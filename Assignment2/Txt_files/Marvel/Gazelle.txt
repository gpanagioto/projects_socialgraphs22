'''Salem's Seven''' is a fictional team of magical beings and former [[supervillains]] appearing in [[Marvel Comics]]. They were initially foes of the [[Scarlet Witch]] and the [[Fantastic Four]], but became allies to both. All seven are the children of [[Nicholas Scratch]] and the grandchildren of [[Agatha Harkness]]. They are humans with magic powers who can transform into fantastic creatures with super-powers.

==Publication history==
The team first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]'' #186 (September 1977), and was created by [[Len Wein]] and [[George Pérez]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=305}}</ref>

==Fictional history==
Salem's Seven originated in New Salem, [[Colorado]], a hidden town in an unsettled part of the [[Rocky Mountains]], populated entirely by magic users who mostly lived in fear of normal humanity due to the persecution they faced during the [[Salem witch trials]]. Salem's Seven were fathered by [[Nicholas Scratch]] with different mothers. Scratch's own mother [[Agatha Harkness]] was the most powerful of the town's inhabitants, but she chose to live among humanity. In time, she becomes the governess for [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]] (son of [[Invisible Woman]] and [[Mister Fantastic]] of the [[Fantastic Four]]). Scratch has Salem's Seven abduct Agatha purportedly for betraying the New Salem community. They bring Franklin back with them to give to Scratch a new host-body, which forces the Fantastic Four to pursue. Although initially overcome and imprisoned, the Four defeat their captors, banish Scratch from this dimension, and save Harkness. When Salem's Seven try to retaliate against Harkness later, she removes their ability to change forms.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #186. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Over the years, Salem's Seven manage to reverse the spells locking them away from their enhanced forms, greatly weakening Harkness in the process. They take control of New Salem, and with Vertigo as their leader, they turn the community against Harkness and burn her at the stake. The [[Scarlet Witch]] and [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|the Vision]] are drawn to New Salem, where they are captured by the Seven. Gazelle disagrees with the group's plans of sacrifice, and is thrown in with the prisoners. The Vision escapes and battles Vertigo, who draws the powers of the other 665 residents of New Salem into herself. When the Vision defeats Vertigo, she loses control of the power. The Scarlet Witch manages to channel some of it off, but in the ensuing explosion all of New Salem is apparently wiped out, including the Seven.<ref>''Vision and the Scarlet Witch'' vol. 2 #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The next Halloween, Wanda attempts to commune with Harkness's spirit, but instead is drawn into the land of the dead, where she confronts spirits of the Seven (except Gazelle) who had aligned themselves with a being that called itself [[Samhain]]. Wanda defeats Samhain and binds him within the spirits of six of the Seven.<ref>''Vision and the Scarlet Witch'' vol. 2 #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Through samples of their DNA, Brutacus, Hydron, Reptilla, Thornn, and Vakume are later reanimated as some of [[Arnim Zola]]'s proto-husks. They are all introduced and then promptly slain for humorous effect by [[Deadpool]].<ref>''Deadpool'' #0. Marvel Comics.</ref>

All members of Salem's Seven are resurrected when the Scarlet Witch's [[mental breakdown]] and manipulation of magic restore them to life.{{issue|date=May 2014}} Scratch manipulates them into releasing [[Shuma-Gorath]], but they later aid the Fantastic Four, [[Diablo (comics)|Diablo]], and [[Doctor Strange]] in defeating Scratch and Shuma-Gorath.{{issue|date=May 2014}} The seven subsequently live with Doctor Strange and are friends of the Fantastic Four.{{issue|date=May 2014}}

In the 2014 ''[[New Warriors]]'' series, Salem's Seven are seen living as the resident protectors of New Salem, which has become a haven for all people "born of magic".<ref>''New Warriors'' vol. 5 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Through the advice of a mysterious benefactor called Quiet Man, [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]] enlistes Gazelle, Reptilla, and Vertigo to join his [[Frightful Four]]. They attack Mister Fantastic in Chicago until Scarlet Witch arrives to help him.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 5 #10. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Hunted (comics)|Hunted]]" storyline, Gazelle is among the animal-themed superhumans captured by [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]] and [[Eric O'Grady#Black Ant|Black Ant]] for [[Kraven the Hunter]]'s Great Hunt, sponsored by [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]]'s company Arcade Industries. In the ensuing chaos, Gazelle is stabbed by a Hunter-Bot controlled by one of the participants.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #18. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Members==

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Marvel===
Appearing in [[Ultimate Fantastic Four]] and operating out of Salem, Oregon, the Seven are a new superhero team. Although they save many people, they are just as quick to fight the Fantastic Four. Members include:

* '''Alpha Dog''': Leader of the Seven. He can alter the density of objects to make it appear he has super strength and invulnerability.
* '''Ghostware''': Member of the Seven who can phase others and self through solid matter.
* '''Neuropath''': Member of the Seven with emotional induction that can control others' emotions.
* '''Penultimate''': Member of the Seven with cybernetically-enhanced body and high-tech weaponry.

* '''Filament''': Member of the Seven who creates hyper-dimensional threads which cut through all matter
* '''Synchron''': Member of the Seven who can alter probability in such a way that he can be in several positions at once, attacking from many directions.

In issue #56, it is revealed that the group are one being: a creature known as the Dragon-of-Seven that can separate into multiple forms. As a single entity, the Dragon-of-Seven takes the form of Agatha Harkness. The Dragon-of-Seven poses as Harkness in order to make the Fantastic Four doubt how they work as a team, and as the Seven so that they would doubt even further, as part of a plot to kidnap the [[Human Torch (disambiguation)|Human Torch]], to force him to explode, and give birth to more just like him. The Dragon-of-Seven is killed when the [[Invisible Woman]] finds a way to reverse the heat waves, so that the Dragon-of-Seven, in the form of the Seven, explodes instead.<ref>''Ultimate Fantastic Four'' #56. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==In other media==
Salem's Seven appeared in ''[[The Avengers: United They Stand]]'' episode "The Sorceress Apprentice". Alongside Nicholas Scratch, they kidnap Agatha Harkness. Scarlet Witch and Vision fight them while the other [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] fight [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]].
