Cartman, why are you doing this? Wuh, that smells.  Uh, I don't really wanna get on there.  I don't know. Awww!  God, it took forever! Hang on, Santa!  Why would Iraqis do that? Why? Oh no. Well good going, asshole! Thanks to you, there's not gonna be any Christmas, and there's no one left to help us! I hope so, or else Santa Claus is as good as dead. Jesus, Santa's sleigh was shot down over Iraq! We're here.  Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here. Oh my God. Iraqis killed Jesus. Uh, on Steven, on Fluffy, on Horace, on Chantel. Uhh... RPG, four o'clock!  We brought Christmas to Iraq! Wow! Look, you guys! Santa got us ''all'' Haibo dolls!  Well, all in all, I have to say this was a pretty special Christmas.  Oh, hey Kenny. Yeah, but I feel like things are finally back to normal.
