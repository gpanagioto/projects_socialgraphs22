I dunno, it was going so fast I couldn't see it.  But I want one. Oh, man, it that the IT? Well, yeah, but I have one question about the way it works. Well,  it seems all the buttons on these front and rear flexigrips are also found on the side of the vehicle.  Well... so... they don't really... do anything. So then, couldn't I just order one that works without going in and out of my ass and mouth?
