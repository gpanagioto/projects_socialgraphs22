We aren't being pushed around anymore. Leave.  You'd better come with us. Come on in, Mr. Marsh. We'll make you some coffee. We're all just like you. I made a mistake too.  I was trying to be ''funny''! I got frustrated and thought I would get some shock laughs. I'm just... not that good of a comedian if you want to know the real truth.  Oh, you don't like that, do ya? Yeah! That's right!
