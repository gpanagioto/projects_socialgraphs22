Kindergartners said it's some big kid in a trench coat.  What are you gonna do?  Butters? Butters, do you understand this stuff is an epidemic in our school?! No, it sucks. I hate this. I wanna go back home. I hate you so much. No. Pleaes, no. It's not mine. I took it from a kindergartner. What are you gonna do? Oh God, this is just gonna get worse, isn't it?
