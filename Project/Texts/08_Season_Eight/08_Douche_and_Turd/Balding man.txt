 You have a home here, friend. I don't know if ''you'' can stay. We'll have to ask Dr. Cornwallis. Come.   Yes, life here is good and natural. But now that you know where our compound is, you'll either have to live with us, or be murdered.  It's not up to you. You'll have to talk with Dr. Cornwallis.  What did he say? Excellent! Dr. Cornwallis is wise beyond his year. Here's your PETA shirt and a bumper sticker.  Stan, I want to introduce you to my stepdaughter, Teresa.  And she's ovulating. Stan, some PETA members are growing concerned that maybe you don't love animals. You... don't belong here, Stan. You should return home. But, why on earth wouldn't you wanna vote? But Stan, don't you know? It's ''always'' between a giant douche and a turd sandwich. Nearly every election since the beginning of time has been between some douche and some turd. They're the only people who suck up enough to make it that far in politics.
