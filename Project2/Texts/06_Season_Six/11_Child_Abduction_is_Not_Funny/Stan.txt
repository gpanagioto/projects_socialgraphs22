I hope this movie doesn't suck ass. Child Tracker? ...Dude, no way! I'm not wearing Child Tracker! I'm not going to school like this! What will all the other guys say?! Huh? But if there is no other team, then it won't be any fun.  I'm not done with my pizza. Dude, this is worse than Child Tracker. But why do I have to leave? Where are we supposed to go? Dude, sometimes I think our parents are really stupid. Bi ologad bag, big nan dastai.   Uh huh, Stan Marsh. }}
