Hello there, children. Bad. Children, I heard about what happened at school today. Now, none of ''you'' took that nasty marijuana, did you? Okay. Because I just want to tell you that drugs are ''bad''! Right. But do you know ''why'' they're bad? And do you have ''any idea'' what that means? Look, children. This is all I'm goin' to say about drugs: stay away from them. There's a time and place for everything, and it's called college. Do you understand? Okay.   Oh, hell no! I can't bear to see that! Don't you boys know what a bris is? They're going to circumcise him. Oh boy. Here we go again. Children... Uhh... What's the one thing that's more sacred to a man than anything else in the world? No, no, no, children, I'm talkin' about the most important part of a man's body. That's right. A "fireman"? Dammit, children! Why do I always have to be the one to explain all this stuff to you? Ask your parents for once!
