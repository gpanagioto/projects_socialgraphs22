 Jimmy and Eric, it looks like a massive snow storm is headed South Park's way. I asked my dad last night and he said that he heard the snow storm is expected on Tuesday. Guys? Wow, those animals are pretty cute. Action News! Yeah! We should make up a bunch of reports about how dangerous it is to be alive. Huh?  Uh-oh, looks like it's Panda Bear Madness Minute!  That is a terrific idea, Stan, A-Okay. We did that! Cough medicine?  Yeah. It was great. The cough companies claim they don't intend for their product to be used by kids to get high! But one look at the packaging tells otherwise.  Dexa Cough, children's formula.
