 The Keepers?  The Guardians of the Secret? Come on in.  The Hare Club For Men has been around for centuries. One of its most famous members was Leonardo da Vinci.  Behold the Last Supper. The dinner Christ had with his disciples the night before he was crucified. What food do you see on the table? Really? Look to Jesus's right.  The food which is a little different color than the others. Yes. The egg marks the secret. It lies directly in front of...  Saint Peter. Eggsactly. But there's something the Church didn't tell you. In actuality, Peter wasn't a man at all. Saint Peter... was a rabbit.  Of course, the Church wouldn't allow da Vinci to paint Peter as a rabbit, so he painted him as a man, but left clues. Look closely. Look closelier.  Look ''more'' closelier.  The original Pope of Christianity. Proof is everywhere. Look at the Pope's hat.  for a rabbit. Because Jesus knew no one man could speak for everyone in a religion. Men can be intolerant; rabbits are pure. But the Catholic Church buried the truth, put a man in charge, and the Hare Club For Men has been decorating eggs ever since to keep the secret in da Vinci's painting alive. I believe Snowball must be a direct descendant of St. Peter himself, and therefor the true heir of the pope's throne.  Boys, get out of here!
