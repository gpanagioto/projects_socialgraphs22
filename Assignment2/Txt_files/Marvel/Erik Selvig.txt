== Fictional character biography ==

=== Early life ===
Erik Selvig was born in 1953. Being of Scandinavian origin, Selvig grew up hearing stories about the legends of [[Asgard (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Asgard]], such as [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]] and [[Bifrost (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bifrost]]. In adulthood, he became a professor of Theoretical Astrophysics at Culver University, where he met [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]]. During his tenure as a university professor, he met [[Jane Foster (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Jane Foster]], whose father was his colleague, and took her under his wing.

=== Helping Thor ===
{{Further|Thor (film)}}
Selvig, Foster, and [[Darcy Lewis]] were travelling in [[New Mexico]] to study thermonuclear astrophysics. While researching in the desert, a storm hit them, with a powerless [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]] suddenly appearing. The trio took him to a local hospital, but he escaped, although he was later captured by [[S.H.I.E.L.D. (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] He went to S.H.I.E.L.D. and told them he was a man named [[Donald Blake (comics)|Donald Blake]], and they released him. However, Thor's brother [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]] sent the [[Destroyer (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Destroyer]] to [[Earth-199999|Earth]] to kill Thor. After the brutal battle, Thor prevailed, and left for [[Asgard (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Asgard]], saying goodbye to Selvig. After the incident, [[Nick Fury (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nick Fury]] recruited him to study the [[Tesseract (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tesseract]], while unknowingly being under Loki's control.

=== Under Loki's control ===
{{Further|The Avengers (2012 film)}}
While researching the Tesseract, Loki opens a portal and arrives on Earth. Loki kills multiple S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, and takes Selvig, including [[Clint Barton (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Clint Barton / Hawkeye]] under his control. In a secret location, Selvig worked to stabilize the Tesseract. Afterwards, he took the Tesseract to the highest point of the [[Stark Tower (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Stark Tower]], and opened a portal, summoning the [[Chitauri (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Chitauri]], who began invading [[New York City]]. There he was confronted by [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]], who knocked him out. Now freed from Loki's mind control, he told [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff]] that they could use Loki's scepter to disable the portal. Romanoff disables the portal while the other [[Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Avengers]] manage to stop the invasion.  Afterwards, Selvig is comforted by Thor, to whom he give the Tesseract.

=== Stopping the Convergence ===
{{Further|Thor: The Dark World}}
A year later, the effect's of Loki's mind control affected Selvig deeply, causing him to have a mental breakdown. Thor comes to ask for his help, as [[Malekith (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Malekith]], a [[Dark Elves (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Dark Elf]], was about to unleash a destruction event called "the Convergence". He worked with Foster and Lewis to develop teleportation devices to send Malekith and his army to their [[Nine Realms (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|realm]]. Thor defeated the Elves and sent them back to their realm.

=== Later life ===
{{Further|Avengers: Age of Ultron|Avengers: Endgame|Spider-Man: Far From Home|Thor: Love and Thunder}}
By 2015, Selvig had fully recovered from his breakdown. While leaving after giving a lecture, Thor asked for his help, to continue the vision given to him by [[Wanda Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wanda Maximoff]]. Thor took him to the Water of Sights, where Thor had visions of the six [[Infinity Stones]]. When Thor lost control of his body, Selvig saves him and the two left from the location. After the Avengers stop [[Ultron (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ultron]]'s plan for world destruction, he joined the new [[Avengers Compound (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Avengers Compound]] and began his work to assist the Avengers in keeping the world safe.

In 2018, Selvig is killed by [[Thanos (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thanos']] during [[The Blip]] but was brought back to life in 2023 by Banner. Sometime later, he hosted a [[Nova (American TV program)|''Nova'']] special dedicated to [[Einstein-Rosen bridges]]. Later, Jane consults him for her cancer treatment but he says that the treatment is ineffective.
