 Richard!  Richard. Ri-chard!  Richard!  Richard!  Richard.  Richard, you ''have'' to move on. I ''want'' you to be happy. Then say it now, Richard. There. Now do you feel better? Of course you don't. Saying good-bye doesn't mean anything. It's the time that we spent together that really matters, not how we loved it.  I love you, Richard. See you soon.
