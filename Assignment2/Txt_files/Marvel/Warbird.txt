==Development==
In an Interview Gerry Conway recalled the reason why Danvers was turned into a super hero, "It actually came about for fairly uncreative reasons… there was this idea, that I was kicking people off books in order to take over writing their books, this was of course not the case, at least from my point of view but given that how was they felt, I said to [[Stan Lee|Stan]]," "well is there any way that we could create some stuff so I'm not kicking people off books ?" Stan had either just created [[She-Hulk]] or was thinking about creating her", and we thought, 'can we come up with another female super hero, that can use the [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Marvel]] name?'"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Eury |first1=MIcheal |title=Back Issue! |date=2012 |issue=54 |pages=23–24}}</ref>

==Publication history==
===1960s===

The character debuted in ''[[Marvel Super-Heroes (comics)|Marvel Super-Heroes]]'' #13 (March 1968) by writer [[Roy Thomas]] and artist [[Gene Colan]]. In the story, she is an [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] in the [[United States Air Force]] and Security Chief of a restricted military base, where Danvers meets Dr. Walter Lawson, the human [[Pseudonym|alias]] of [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[Kree]] hero [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Captain Marvel]].<ref>{{cite comic|title=Marvel Super-Heroes|volume=|issue=#13|writer=[[Roy Thomas]]| artist=[[Gene Colan]]|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|date=March 1968}}</ref> In a later story, Danvers is caught in the explosion of a Kree device after trying to get close to Captain Marvel.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #1 (May 1968).

===1970s===

Danvers resurfaces with superhuman abilities and becomes the hero [[Ms. Marvel]] (created by writer [[Gerry Conway]] and artist [[John Buscema]]) in a self-titled series in January 1977, at first written by Gerry Conway and later by [[Chris Claremont]]. In the series, she is the editor of ''Women Magazine'', a spin-off of the ''[[Daily Bugle]]''. It is revealed that the energy exposure from the explosion of a device called the "Psyche-Magnetron" caused Danvers's genetic structure to meld with Captain Marvel's, effectively turning her into a human-Kree hybrid.<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' #1–23 (Jan. 1977–April 1979).

At the time of the publication of ''Ms. Marvel'' #1 in 1977, the title was self-consciously socially progressive for its time. This was reflected in the use of the word "[[Ms.]]", at the time associated with the [[feminist movement]],<ref name="Comics Alliance 10 November 2014">{{cite news|last1=Weeler |first1=Andrew |title=Oh Captain My Captain: How Carol Danvers Became Marvel's Biggest Female Hero |url=http://comicsalliance.com/captain-marvel-carol-danvers-marvel-biggest-female-hero/|work=[[Comics Alliance]] |date=November 10, 2014|access-date= December 7, 2014|url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141209034738/http://comicsalliance.com/captain-marvel-carol-danvers-marvel-biggest-female-hero/|archive-date=December 9, 2014  }}</ref> and in Danvers fighting for [[equal pay for equal work]] in her civilian identity.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://marvel.com/news/comics/22834/marvel_women_of_the_70s_ms_marvel|title=Marvel Women of the 70: Ms. Marvel|last1=White|first1=Brett|website=Marvel.com|date= July 9, 2014|access-date=December 7, 2014 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170724104758/https://news.marvel.com/comics/22834/marvel_women_of_the_70s_ms_marvel/|archive-date=July 24, 2017}}</ref>

===1980s===
In ''The Avengers'' #200 (Oct. 1980), which was written by [[Bob Layton]], [[David Michelinie]], [[George Pérez]], and [[Jim Shooter]], Ms. Marvel is kidnapped by a character named Marcus (the apparent son of Avengers foe [[Immortus]]) and taken to an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate dimension]], where she is raped by Marcus and impregnated. She gives birth on Earth to a child that rapidly ages into another version of Marcus, who is ultimately unable to remain on Earth after [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]] mistakenly damages his machine and takes Ms. Marvel back to the alternate dimension with no opposition from the Avengers, who perceive Ms. Marvel and Marcus to have fallen in love. Comic book historian Carol A. Strickland criticized the storyline in an essay, "The Rape of Ms. Marvel", due to the storyline implying Marcus to have potentially [[brainwash]]ed Danvers into falling in love with him.<ref>{{Cite journal| url= http://www.carolastrickland.com/comics/msmarvel/index.html|title=The Rape of Ms. Marvel|last= Strickland|first=Carol A.|journal=LoC|issue=1|date= January 1980|access-date=April 15, 2019 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190327101150/http://www.carolastrickland.com/comics/msmarvel/index.html|archive-date= March 27, 2019}}</ref> Citing Marcus' line, "Finally, after relative weeks of such efforts—and admittedly, with a subtle boost from Immortus' machines—you became mine", Strickland posited that this constituted rape. As a former writer of the solo title, Chris Claremont also commented on the inappropriateness of the storyline, having been disallowed from having the character have a normal child and be a [[single mother]].<ref>Chris Claremont, quoted in ''X-Men Companion'' #2 (Fantagraphics Books, 1982): "Actually, my reaction was a lot stronger than that. But how callous! How cruel! How unfeeling! Considering that <nowiki>[the Avengers]</nowiki> must have seen Ms. Marvel only a couple of days before, or even a couple of months before. She wasn't pregnant then. How could she be eight months pregnant now?"</ref>

Claremont wrote a follow up to the Marcus story in ''The Avengers'' Annual #10 (1981). In that story, Danvers is revealed to have returned to Earth—courtesy of Immortus's technology after Marcus continued to age and die of old age—but is attacked by the mutant [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], who permanently absorbs the character's abilities and memories. Danvers' memories are restored by [[Professor X]], and an angry confrontation with the Avengers concerning their failure to realize Marcus had brainwashed her follows.<ref>''The Avengers'' Annual #10 (1981). Marvel Comics.</ref> Claremont continued to develop the character in the title ''The [[Uncanny X-Men]]''. Danvers enters [[the Pentagon]] and, while wiping the government's files on the [[X-Men]], also deletes all records of herself in a symbolic break with her life as Ms. Marvel.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #158 (June 1982). Marvel Comics.</ref> During an adventure in space with the X-Men, Danvers is changed courtesy of experimentation by the alien race, the [[Brood (comics)|Brood]], into a newly empowered character called Binary (created by writer Chris Claremont and artist [[Dave Cockrum]]).<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #164 (Dec. 1982). Marvel Comics.</ref> Drawing on the power of a cosmic phenomenon called a [[white hole]], Danvers becomes capable of generating the power of a star. As Binary, the character has a number of encounters with the X-Men,<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #166–167 (Feb.–March 1983); #171, 174 (July, Oct. 1983); #200–201 (Dec. 1985 – Jan. 1986).

Marvel Comics.</ref>

Claremont expanded on the incident with the character Rogue by having the Carol Danvers persona manifest itself within Rogue's mind, sometimes overpowering Rogue's personality. This happens to Rogue on several occasions, which results in an uneasy armistice between the personalities within Rogue's mind.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #182 (June 1984); #203 (March 1986); #235–239 (Oct. 1988–Feb. 1989).

Marvel Comics.</ref> After Rogue passes through the ancient, supernatural gateway called the [[Siege Perilous (comics)|Siege Perilous]], the Ms. Marvel persona is separated from her as an independent entity. Within the same issue, the Ms. Marvel persona is killed by [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]].<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #269 (Oct. 1990). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===1990s===
Carol Danvers continued to make sporadic appearances,<ref>''X-Men Spotlight On... Starjammers'' #1–2 (May–June 1990). Marvel Comics.</ref> and two additional issues planned for the original title—prevented by cancellation—were printed in a quarterly anthology series.<ref>''Marvel Super-Heroes'' vol. 2 #10–11 (July–Oct. 1992). Marvel Comics.</ref> That same year she appeared extensively in the storyline "[[Operation Galactic Storm]]". Near the conclusion of the story, Danvers loses her connection to the white hole she drew her powers from while diverting anti-matter from the Earth's sun left by the passing Nega Bomb, reverting to her original Ms. Marvel powers. She retained the energy manipulation and absorption powers she had as Binary, but on a smaller scale.<ref>''Quasar'' #34 (May 1992). Marvel Comics.</ref>

After several more team and solo appearances<ref>''The Avengers'' #350–351 (both Aug. 1992); ''Starblast'' #1 (Jan. 1994); ''[[X-Men Unlimited]]'' #1 (Dec. 1996); ''Excalibur'' #116 (Jan. 1998). Marvel Comics.</ref> she rejoins the Avengers<ref>''The Avengers'' vol. 3 #4 (May 1998). Marvel Comics.</ref> with the new alias Warbird (created by writer [[Kurt Busiek]] and artist [[George Pérez]]). Busiek explored the character by having her develop [[alcoholism]], struggling to come to terms with the loss of her cosmic powers and memories. Danvers disgraces herself during the "Live Kree or Die" storyline<ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 3 #7; ''[[Captain America (comic book)|Captain America]]'' vol. 3 #8; ''[[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]]'' #10; ''The Avengers'' vol. 3 #7 (Aug. 1998).

===2000s===

As Warbird, the character returns to the Avengers and plays a key role in the "[[Kang Dynasty]]" plotline.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3 #41–54 (June 2001–July 2002)</ref> [[Kang the Conqueror|Kang]]'s son Marcus, the [[Scarlet Centurion]], falls in love with her, but she rejects him, in part because he reminds her of Marcus, son of Kang's older alter ego Immortus, who raped her. The Scarlet Centurion nonetheless helps her to defeat the [[Master of the World (comics)|Master of the World]], a supervillain whose alien technology becomes the key to defeating Kang. In the course of the fight, Warbird kills the Master, and after the final victory over Kang she demands a [[court martial]] to review her actions. The court martial finds her killing justified as an act of war, and Carol continues as an Avenger. After the [[Avengers Disassembled|Avengers disband]], Warbird leaves the group, and, along with other prominent former Avengers like [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], [[Hank Pym]], [[Falcon (Marvel Comics)|Falcon]] and [[Wonder Man]], is not included in the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] group soon formed by [[Iron Man]] and [[Captain America]].<ref>''The Avengers'' #500–503 (Sept.–Dec. 2004), ''The Avengers: Finale'' #1 (Jan. 2005)</ref>

When describing her pitch for the series, DeConnick said at [[WonderCon]] 2012 that it could be "pretty much be summed up with 'Carol Danvers as [[Chuck Yeager]].{{'"}} She said the series would contemplate what Captain Marvel's legend means to Danvers, how she will wield it, and how the rest of the [[Marvel Universe]] reacts.<ref name=WCCP>{{cite web |url= http://marvel.com/news/story/18290/wondercon_2012_captain_marvel|title=WonderCon 2012: Captain Marvel |last=Beard|first=Jim|date=March 17, 2012|publisher= Marvel|access-date=March 19, 2012| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131115133444/http://marvel.com/news/story/18290/wondercon_2012_captain_marvel|archive-date=November 15, 2013}}</ref>

Danvers also rejoined the main Avengers team as Captain Marvel in volume 5 of ''The Avengers'' and in the spin-off series, ''[[Avengers Assemble (comics)|Avengers Assemble]]'', also written by DeConnick.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 5 #2 (Dec. 2012)</ref> Editor Lauren Sankovitch said that Marvel editors liked DeConnick's work and that adding her to the team would "get some lady power in the Avengers lineup".

In 2013, Carol Danvers starred in the ''Captain Marvel'' / ''Avengers Assemble'' [[fictional crossover|crossover storyline]], "The Enemy Within".

DeConnick said, "The big difference is we were grounded in New York City for the previous volume; at least in the latter part of it.

During the 2015 "[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]" storyline, Danvers headlined her own tie-in series, ''Captain Marvel and the Carol Corps'' co-written by DeConnick and [[Kelly Thompson]] and drawn by López. In the series, Danvers leads an elite squadron of female fighter pilots stationed at an airbase, Hala Field, where she is the only superpowered being; this leads the corps to help Danvers answer questions about her origin, which puts her in conflict with the controlling forces of [[Battleworld#Third Battleworld|Battleworld]].<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.fastcompany.com/3043329/exclusive-first-look-at-marvels-newest-women-driven-comic|title=Exclusive First Look At Marvel's Newest Women-Driven Comic|last=Nagy|first=Evie|publisher=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]|date=March 10, 2015|access-date=August 25, 2015| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180110054535/https://www.fastcompany.com/3043329/exclusive-first-look-at-marvels-newest-women-driven-comic|archive-date=January 10, 2018}}</ref> During the storyline, Danvers becomes a member of [[A-Force]], Battleworld's all-female team of Avengers.

Continuing with the All-New, All-Different Marvel initiative, Danvers starred in the ninth volume of ''Captain Marvel'', written by ''[[Agent Carter (TV series)|Agent Carter]]'' showrunners Tara Butters and Michele Fazekas, with artwork by [[Kris Anka]], which debuted in October 2015. The series, set eight months after "Secret Wars", sees Danvers taking over the responsibilities of [[S.W.O.R.D. (comics)|S.W.O.R.D.]], the military agency that was previously designated to protect Earth from intergalactic threats. Editor [[Sana Amanat]] said, "This is really meant to be the next level for Captain Marvel. Carol is really meant to be a soldier and a commander, and also a diplomat. We're really trying to build up this space complex and this space world."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fastcompany.com/3047641/most-creative-people/a-first-look-at-the-new-captain-marvel-written-by-agent-carter-showrunn|title=A First Look At The New Captain Marvel, Written By "Agent Carter" Showrunners|last=Nagy |first=Evie|publisher=Fast Company|date=June 23, 2015|access-date=August 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180110054516/https://www.fastcompany.com/3047641/a-first-look-at-the-new-captain-marvel-written-by-agent-carter-showrunn|archive-date=January 10, 2018}}</ref> At this time, Danvers also joined [[Ultimates (2015 team)|The Ultimates]]. Series writer [[Al Ewing]] said, "Carol's currently running Alpha Flight, which is Earth's premier space agency. [She has] seen the highs and the lows of the superhero business, and come out the other side. Right now, Carol's in the ascendant, culturally, both in-universe and outside it... Carol's story in ''The Ultimates'' is very much about her links with the ordinary super-hero world, and about trying to form a bridge between that world and the world of The Ultimates."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/26688-the-ultimates-get-pretty-damn-cosmic-in-new-ongoing.html|title=THE ULTIMATES Get 'Pretty Damn Cosmic' In New Ongoing|last=Marston|first=George|publisher= Newsarama |date=November 6, 2015|access-date=March 28, 2016| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180922024350/https://www.newsarama.com/26688-the-ultimates-get-pretty-damn-cosmic-in-new-ongoing.html|archive-date=September 22, 2018}}</ref>

In 2016, Danvers played a predominant role in the storyline "[[Civil War II]]", the core miniseries of which was written by Brian Michael Bendis and illustrated by [[David Marquez (comics)|David Marquez]]. In the story, Danvers is the leader of a faction of superheroes who wish to use [[Ulysses (comics)#Ulysses (Inhuman)|Ulysses']] precognitive power to profile people who in his visions, will commit future crimes. About her position Bendis stated, "From Carol's point of view, she is like, 'You're telling me the world is still turning at the end of the day and everyone is safe? I don't care... If it keeps us safe, that's fine.{{'"}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/05/07/brian-michael-bendis-on-tearing-marvel-s-heroes-apart-again-in-civil-war-ii.html|title=Brian Michael Bendis on Tearing Marvel's Heroes Apart (Again) in 'Civil War II'|last=Lendof|first=Emil|publisher=[[The Daily Beast]]|date=May 7, 2016|access-date=July 8, 2016|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170204213434/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/05/07/brian-michael-bendis-on-tearing-marvel-s-heroes-apart-again-in-civil-war-ii.html|archive-date=February 4, 2017}}</ref> Following the conclusion of "Civil War II", Danvers starred in ''The Mighty Captain Marvel'', by writer [[Margaret Stohl]] and artist Ramon Rosanas, which sees Danvers become a household name. Stohl explained, "She will be one of the most popular heroes on the planet—but that's not something she is very comfortable with. And of course she's lost a lot of folks that she's loved so she has to cope with that, too. That being said, she still has a job to do as commander of the Alpha Flight. Her latest mission being recruiting and training new cadets.

Beginning in July 2018, Danvers headlined a limited series, ''The Life of Captain Marvel'', by Stohl and artist [[Carlos Pacheco]]. The series is described as a "retelling" of Danvers' origin story, but Stohl insisted that it is not a "reinvention" explaining, "You look through a different lens. It's nothing you'll expect and nothing you've seen happen, but there will be parts of her life that change the context of what you've seen before, so it's telling the other side of the story, of how she came to be." Stohl also said that there would be similarities with the [[Captain Marvel (film)|2019 film]], but the film is "its own thing".<ref>{{cite web |url= https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/captain-marvel-author-margaret-stohl-origin-story-expect/story?id=53421255|title='Captain Marvel' author Margaret Stohl says new origin story is 'nothing you'll expect' |last=Rothman|first=Michael|work=[[ABC News]] |date=March 1, 2018|access-date=March 3, 2018| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180619190018/https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/captain-marvel-author-margaret-stohl-origin-story-expect/story?id=53421255|archive-date=June 19, 2018}}</ref> The series reveals that Danvers' mother is Kree and that the blast that was responsible for her powers only awakened her preexisting Kree genes, and did not fuse her human DNA with Mar-Vell's Kree DNA as [[Retroactive continuity|originally written]].<ref>{{cite web| url= https://io9.gizmodo.com/marvel-just-added-another-twist-to-captain-marvels-orig-1829205937|title=Marvel Just Added Another Twist to Captain Marvel's Origin Story|last=Whitbrook |first=James|publisher= [[iO9]]|date=September 20, 2018|access-date= October 2, 2018| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190305234430/https://io9.gizmodo.com/marvel-just-added-another-twist-to-captain-marvels-orig-1829205937|archive-date=March 5, 2019}}</ref>

In early 2019 Danvers starred in the tenth volume of ''Captain Marvel'' written by [[Kelly Thompson]] and drawn by Carmen Carnero. The story sees Danvers return to New York City after a stint in space and reconnect with allies and friends like Iron Man and Spider-Woman, as well as explore new relationships. Thompson teased, "There will definitely be some romance and it may be someone we all know and have seen before in Marvel Comics."<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/02/arts/captain-marvel-new-comic-series.html|title=Captain Marvel to Get New Comic Series Ahead of Big-Screen Debut|last=Gustines|first=George Gene|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 2, 2018|access-date=October 2, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181007055603/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/02/arts/captain-marvel-new-comic-series.html|archive-date=October 7, 2018}}</ref>

===2020s===
Danvers plays a major role in the 2020 "[[Empyre]]" crossover storyline written by Al Ewing and Dan Slott, in which Danvers is elected as the [[Ronan the Accuser|Supreme Accuser]] of the newly forged Kree/Skrull alliance under [[Hulkling]] and leads her own corps of Accusers that includes Spider-Woman, [[Hazmat (comics)|Hazmat]] and [[War Machine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/captain-marvel-accusers-team-empyre/|title=Captain Marvel Assembles a Heavy-Hitting Team for Empyre|last=Galanis|first= Evangelia|publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date= February 29, 2020|access-date=July 30, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cbr.com/empyre-why-captain-marvel-strongest-avenger/|title=Empyre Shows Why Captain Marvel Is REALLY the Strongest Avenger|last=Galanis|first= Evangelia|publisher= Comic Book Resources|date=July 23, 2020|access-date=July 30, 2020}}</ref> During an investigation, Danvers discovers that she has a half-sister, [[List of Marvel Comics characters: L#Lauri-ell|Lauri-ell]], who was genetically engineered using her mother's DNA.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.marvel.com/articles/comics/get-to-know-lauri-ell-the-newly-revealed-half-sister-of-captain-marvel|title = Get to Know Lauri-ell, the Newly Revealed Half-Sister of Captain Marvel}}</ref>

==Characterization==
With ''Ms. Marvel'' #1 in 1977, writer [[Gerry Conway]] played a significant role in the character's development, writing in his introduction to the series, "you might see a parallel between ''her'' quest for identity, and the modern woman's quest for raised consciousness, for self-liberation, for identity".<ref name="MsPrint">{{Cite comic | writer=Conway, Gerry | story=Ms. Prints | title=Ms. Marvel | issue=#1 | date=Jan. 1977}}</ref>

Ms. Marvel's uniform and abilities, however, were derived from the character's then-contemporary male counterpart: Captain Marvel. The ''Ms. Marvel'' [[comic book letter column|letters page]] ("Ms. Prints") featured letters debating whether or not the character was feminist. Reader (and frequent [[letterhack]]) Jana C. Hollingsworth took issue with Ms. Marvel's entire origin:

{{blockquote|For the eleven years I've been a comics fan, I've been proud of how Marvel resisted the temptation to create male-based heroines à la Supergirl. It's been proudly proclaimed that Ms. Marvel is ''not'' [[Jean Grey|Marvel Girl]]; well, maybe the early Marvel Girl did have weak powers and an insipid personality, but at least her powers were ''her'' powers and her personality was ''her'' personality.... I hope you can change her costume if it's all possible, and keep her on her own instead of associating her with Captain Marvel....<ref>{{Cite comic | writer=Hollingsworth, Jana C. | story=Ms. Prints | title=Ms. Marvel | issue=5 | date=May 1977}}</ref>}}

Another reader had issue with the character's outfit: "Question: where is a woman who wears long sleeves, gloves, high boots and a scarf (winter wear), and at the same time has a bare back, belly, and legs? The Arctic equator? That costume requires a few alterations."<ref>{{Cite comic | writer=Lipp, Debbie | story=Ms. Prints | title=Ms. Marvel | issue=8 | date=Aug. 1977}}</ref> These questions, and the controversial rape in ''The Avengers'' #200, caused many readers to question the character's portrayal, and whether she was a good role model for female readers:<ref>Chris Claremont, quoted in ''X-Men Companion'' #2 (Fantagraphics, 1982)</ref>

{{Blockquote|As Carol [Strickland] pointed out in her article in ''LOC'' [#1], women tend to get very short shrift in comics. They are either portrayed as wallflowers or as supermacho insensitive men with different body forms, who almost invariably feel guilty about their lack of femininity. And it's always seemed to me that, why does this have to be exclusive? Can you not have a woman who is ruthless and capable and courageous and articulate and intelligent and all the other buzz-words—heroic when the need arises, and yet feminine and gentle and compassionate, at others? That was what I tried to do with Ms. Marvel. I tried to create a character who had all the attributes that made her a top-secret agent yet at the same time was a compassionate, warm, humorous, witty, intelligent, attractive woman.}}

It has been noted that "Danvers' initial appearances portrayed her as a strong character, but that changed over time—even after she gained super powers."<ref>{{Cite news | title=Heroines shine in 3 titles | last=Munguia | first=Shawn | newspaper=Valley Morning Star | location=Harlingen, Texas | date=March 25, 2008 | url=http://www.valleymorningstar.com/articles/marvel-22310-character-new.html}}</ref> When Ms. Marvel received her own title in the 2000s, Marvel Comics was "determined to have the character take center stage in the Marvel Universe", with "Joe Quesada and the other powers [having] had the character play major roles in their huge 'House of M' crossover, in the 'New Avengers' and in the gargantuan success that is 'Civil War'."

==Powers and abilities==
As Ms. Marvel, Carol Danvers initially possessed superhuman strength, endurance, stamina, physical durability, a limited precognitive "seventh sense" and a perfectly amalgamated human/Kree physiology that rendered her resistant to most toxins and poisons.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Daniel |first=Tiffani |date=2019-05-15 |title=All Of Captain Marvel's Powers, Ranked |url=https://screenrant.com/avengers-captain-marvel-powers-ranked/ |access-date=2022-08-16 |website=ScreenRant |language=en-US}}</ref> She originally only had the power of flight thanks to a contraption under her suit.  As Binary, the character could tap the energy of a "[[white hole]]", allowing full control and manipulation of stellar energies, and therefore control over heat, the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] and [[gravity]]. [[Speed of light|Light speed]] travel and the ability to survive in the vacuum of space were also possible.<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' #1–3</ref>

Although the link to the white hole was eventually severed, Danvers retains her Binary powers on a smaller scale, enabling her to both absorb energy and project it in photonic form. She can also still survive in space. While she lacks a constant source of energy to maintain the abilities at their previous cosmic level, she can temporarily assume her Binary form if empowered with a high enough infusion of energy.

Danvers possesses superhuman strength and durability, can fly at roughly six times the speed of sound,<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #1 (Aug. 2012)</ref> retains her "seventh sense", and can discharge explosive blasts of [[radiant energy]], which she fires from her fingertips. She also demonstrates the ability to absorb other forms of energy, such as electricity, to further magnify her strength and energy projection, up to the force of an exploding nuclear weapon.<ref name="The Mighty Avengers 6"/> When sufficiently augmented, she can withstand the pressure from a {{convert|92|ST|kg|adj=on}} weight and strike with a similar level of force, although [[Henry Pym|Hank Pym]] theorized that this likely was not her limit.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3 #41 (June 2001)</ref> Danvers cannot absorb magical energy without consequence, though she aided [[Dr. Strange]] in the defeat of the mystic menace, Sir Warren Traveler.<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' vol. 2 #5 (Sept. 2006)</ref> Carol Danvers is also able to recover faster and more competently than normal rate.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Daniel |first=Tiffani |date=2019-05-15 |title=All Of Captain Marvel's Powers, Ranked |url=https://screenrant.com/avengers-captain-marvel-powers-ranked/ |access-date=2022-09-07 |website=ScreenRant |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Staff |first=C.

== Reception ==

=== Critical reception ===
Tom Stewart of ''[[Screen Rant]]'' stated, "Carol Danvers, aka Captain Marvel, Ms. Marvel, Binary, and Warbird is a woman of many identities, but when it comes down to it, she is always Carol. She's one of Marvel Comics' strongest, most reliable, and most relatable characters. She has been around in one form or another since 1968 and has been Captain Marvel since 2012, bearing the name proudly.

Richard Newby of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' stated, "Carol Danvers is difficult to pin down because there’s no one truly comparable to her. She stands apart from so many of our most well-known superheroes and that’s what makes her entry into the MCU so exciting.

So, in its own way, is “confidence.” None of this is revelatory to say; feminists have been talking about it ad (their own) nauseam for a long time.

Tanzim Pardiwalla of ''[[Mashable]]'' called Carol Danvers one of the "badass Women of Marvel," stating, "The Captain of the Universe is obviously on the list! What makes her great is the origin story. If you’re wondering how women will relate to a character so strong, you should check out her back story. 'Higher. Faster.

Yeah, I said it. Even before she received her flight and energy-beam superpowers in an alien explosion, Carol Danvers was an Air Force pilot who could and probably would kick your butt. She lives in an apartment at the top of the Statue of Liberty, is best friends with Spider-Woman, and is one of the Avengers. In her most recent run, penned by sass-master Kelly Sue DeConnick, Carol jets off into space with her cat, Chewie (she's a big Star Wars fan, clearly) to keep an eye on the Avengers' cosmic affairs…and also on the Guardians of the Galaxy, who tend to get themselves into some trouble. She's one of the toughest women on Earth (and off it). One other amazing thing: Captain Marvel used to be a dude character, before Carol took over his powers.

She can also control gravity and light, and can manipulate and absorb radiation and magic. This isn’t explored in the films, but she can tether herself to a white hole to gain even more power. As Marvel Studios’ Kevin Feige has said, "Captain Marvel, she is as powerful a character as we've ever put in a movie.

==== Carol Corps ====
Rachel Edidin of ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' called Carol Danvers a "fan favorite," stating, "One of the most close-knit fandoms in comics has rallied around a character who's only recently found her way to the front lines. The Thursday before Emerald City Comic Con, the crowded floor of Seattle's Museum of Flight is a swirl of red and blue and gold fabric fashioned into various garments: jumpsuits, dresses, hats, scarves, t-shirts. One group of people has made tulle brooches. It's fan fashion at its finest, and it's all focused on one very particular Marvel Comics superhero—but not the one you might think. Sure, there's a Captain America in the corner, and a Bucky here and there, but mostly, these fans are dressed as a different Captain: Carol Danvers, who in 2012 became Captain Marvel. And this is Carol Corps. [...] In the larger and significantly male-dominated climate of superhero fandom, the Carol Corps is a notable exception. The majority of the 300 fans milling around the museum are female; in fact, the Corps' central rallying points—crafting and cosplay—are both more traditionally feminine areas of fandom. [...]  In the last two years, they've raised thousands of dollars for girls' leadership initiatives. A loosely organized group called the "yarn brigade" sends Captain Marvel-inspired knitwear to any fan in need of comfort or warmth. Tonight, though, the Corps is celebrating: talking about comic books, admiring costumes, and clustering bashfully around DeConnick like she's a rock star (which, in this room, she kind of is)."<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Edidin |first=Rachel |title=The Minor-League Superhero Who Changed the Face of Fandom |language=en-US |magazine=Wired |url=https://www.wired.com/2014/04/captain-marvel-carol-corps/ |access-date=2022-09-04 |issn=1059-1028}}</ref> Alex Abad-Santos of ''[[Vox Media|Vox]]'' asserted, "DeConnick wrote the vaunted 2012 Captain Marvel comic that saw Carol Danvers take the title of Captain Marvel and become one of the leaders of the Avengers. And in promoting the book — both online, via platforms like Tumblr and Twitter, and in real life, at comic conventions and meetups — she started the fandom known as the Carol Corps. On the surface, they look like any other devout fandom: They worship the character of Carol Danvers and cosplay as her space commander alter ego. But the Carol Corps, DeConnick, and the character they love are also pushing back against a history of the comic book industry neglecting some of its characters, its readers, and the very women who make comic books. Ultimately, this fandom is more than fidelity for a character — it’s about the journey Danvers has taken to become a central figure in Marvel’s crowded comic book universe and about DeConnick’s spirit to push for something more for the character, for herself as a creator, and for fans. The Carol Corps represents Carol Danvers’s resilience and heroism just as well as, if not better than, the character’s own adventures. And her fight to be a hero is theirs too."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Abad-Santos |first=Alex |date=2019-03-08 |title=Captain Marvel's Carol Corps: how a sisterhood of fans made Carol Danvers great again |url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/3/8/18249313/captain-marvel-carol-corps-fandom |access-date=2022-09-03 |website=Vox |language=en}}</ref> Caitlin Rosberg of ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' stated, " Comics has never been a particularly welcoming space for new fans, especially if they aren’t white and male. I started buying individual comics issues for the first time in 2011, after years of hoarding trade paperbacks and borrowing from the library. I was hesitant to step back into a comic book store, but the creation of a Ladies’ Night that met at my local shop — and the announcement that Carol Danvers was going to be Captain Marvel — seemed like a sign. It was finally safe to set up my own pull list. For the most part, I was right. As an industry and a fandom, comics still has a lot of problems — but overall it’s far more friendly to women, especially white women, than it was prior to that moment. It wasn’t all Carol and Kelly Sue, of course. Books like ''Nimona, Lumberjanes'', ''Giant Days, Gotham Academy'', ''DC Bombshells'', and the new''Ms. Marvel'' helped usher in an era driven by young female characters in strong stories. That doesn’t even touch on web comics or manga that are even more popular with female readers. The comics industry appeals to a much broader demographic than the stereotypes would have you believe, and the Carol Corps were a part of that. At the height of the group’s popularity and engagement, it felt like the Carol Corps was everywhere. Tumblr was full of posts sharing favorite panels and cosplay guides, fans were showing up in costume at conventions and marathons and on issue covers. Whispers about the cancellation of ''Captain Marvel'', or even that of other diverse titles, brought the specter of the Carol Corps, a threat to editors and publishers that might dare to test their loyalty and wrath."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Rosberg |first=Caitlin |date=2019-03-06 |title=The pressure on Captain Marvel is overwhelming — and it always has been |url=https://www.polygon.com/2019/3/6/18253214/captain-marvel-history-carol-corps-fandom |access-date=2022-09-03 |website=Polygon |language=en-US}}</ref> Elise Ringo of ''[[Tor.com]]'' wrote, "One of the remarkable things that came out of the Kelly Sue DeConnick run on Captain Marvel was the group of fans who called themselves the Carol Corps. It wasn’t something organized, wasn’t institutional—it arose, entirely organically, out of people who found themselves congregating around a single character. Captain Marvel became a rallying point for the female comic book fans who frequently find themselves treated as outsiders, and later for people of all genders who felt marginalized by mainstream comics fandom. The Carol Corps was representative of something bigger than a single superhero and a group of people who rallied around her to champion inclusivity and openness. The title of a panel Vulture hosted at NYCC in 2014 indicates how formative, and how significant, Captain Marvel and the Carol Corps were for the development of a new, specifically female comic book fandom: Carol Corps and Beyond: The Future of Female Fandom."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Ringo |first=Elise |date=2019-03-04 |title=Why I'm Counting on Captain Marvel |url=https://www.tor.com/2019/03/04/why-im-counting-on-captain-marvel/ |access-date=2022-09-04 |website=Tor.com |language=en-US}}</ref>

A bold new super-heroine in the senses-stunning tradition of Spider-Man!” Amen, indeed. Carol returns as a heroine and a features writer-turned-magazine editor, maligned by both the general public who believe her to be a publicity stunt and her editor, J Jonah Jameson, who happily badmouths “women’s lib.” Standing firm on her salary demands, making friends with Mary Jane Watson, confessing to amnesia during a brawl with the Scorpion, Carol is immediately more than she ever was."<ref>{{Cite web |last=published |first=Claire Napier |date=2020-04-01 |title=10 Best Captain Marvel stories |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/best-captain-marvel-stories/ |access-date=2022-09-06 |website=gamesradar |language=en}}</ref>

Hilary Goldstein of ''[[IGN]]'' called ''Ms. Marvel'' #1 "good, but not a necessity," stating, "Brian Reed is trying to bring two of Marvel's best female superheroes back to the forefront. His first shot, the ''Spider-Woman: Origin'' miniseries, is a decent re-introduction to Jessica Drew. ''Ms. Marvel'' is a stronger title, however. Reed gets it. Here is one of the most powerful characters in the Marvel U and she has basically been seen as a B player. The contrast between her abilities and her low self-esteem is a great lead-in to a new series. Extra kudos to Reed for acknowledging Danvers ties to both the Avengers and the X-Men. While the focus is on her Avengers past, Reed brings back a classic X-Men villain to end the first issue.

Benjamin Bailey of ''[[IGN]]'' gave ''Captain Marvel'' #1 a grade of 9 out of 10, saying, "Captain Marvel is a comic book about an old character that takes up the legacy of a dead character to become a new character with the dead character's name. There's a new costume thrown in mix, too. Fortunately, thanks to some stellar writing and inspired artwork, it's not as confusing as it sounds.

Before her 2012 run, Carol was known as Ms. Marvel, and Captain Mar-Vell was a Kree man who fought to keep earth safe. However, when DeConnick took the reins, she not only promoted Carol up the ranks of the Air Force, but she gave her a much needed defining character arc. DeConnick breathed new life into Carol, making her not only as strong, confident, and competent but also kind and caring. She created a character we all could identify with and many fans donning costumes and dubbing themselves the Carol Corps.

Doug Zawisza of ''[[CBR.com]]'' asserted, "''Captain Marvel and the Carol Corps'' #1 feels like an early Cold War tale, especially given Lopez's costume design for Danvers. Additionally, DeConnick and Thompson write a hierarchy that depends on obedience and trust, with Danvers enticed to follow orders throughout the issue. The unknown and the adventure of investigating it drive this story, much like the excitement of early Cold War dramas, where both sides seek to learn "what is out there." As readers learn in ''Captain Marvel and the Carol Corps'' #1, when all serve the will of god and master Victor Von Doom, treason becomes blasphemy and scientific inquiry becomes reason of suspicion. With the characters and the rules effectively established in this issue, DeConnick, Thompson and Lopez are ready to continue the adventure as they prepare readers to learn about the mysteries of Battleworld alongside Danvers."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Zawisza |first=Doug |date=2015-06-11 |title=Captain Marvel and the Carol Corps #1 |url=https://www.cbr.com/captain-marvel-and-the-carol-corps-1/ |access-date=2022-09-03 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref> ''[[IGN]]'' gave ''Captain Marvel and the Carol Corps'' #1 a grade of 8.2 out of 10, writing, "So far the best Secret Wars tie-ins have been those able to mix the old with the new, something Kelly Sue DeConnick and Kelly Thompson pull off with their first issue. The fun and energy of DeConnick’s initial run carries over into the Carol Corp, each wisecracking member at once appealing and familiar. Though only the first issue, the writing team has already managed to give Carol a weight beyond her mentoring status, certain reveals forcing the character to question what she sees versus what she’s told. This more serious conflict of self meshes well with the book’s light and comedic tone, as everyone from the bantering pilots to the newly thunder blessed Tic get their moments. David Lopez again proves a great fit for the series, his lively pencils and layered expressions adding depth to the various tonal beats.

Jamie Rice of ''[[ComicsVerse]]'' called ''Captain Marvel'' #1 a "nice self-contained story," asserting, "In addition to having amazing character and story, ''Captain Marvel'' also has some truly beautiful art and colors by Kris Anka and Matt Wilson respectively. Space is always a beautiful locale for Carol, and this comic gives a fresh take on Carol’s typical background. It walks a nice line between reality and heightened reality that is particularly appropriate when you are dealing with a hero that has very real emotions while also having the ability to breathe and fly around in space. And while Carol’s character outfit hasn’t really changed, her physical form, in a slight departure from previous portrayals, is more muscular and impressive than ever. Captain Marvel is literally a super strong woman now, which is a nice and bold direction for a comic to take. I have always thought that there is a slight disconnect in the art when a female character is supposed to be super strong but still sports a slender physique – Thor and She-Hulk, however, have also recently been getting some more muscles, so maybe that trend is on the outs. Overall, ''Captain Marvel'' fans should have nothing to worry about in this new beginning. Carol is still Carol, and it looks like this new creative team has no shortage of ideas for stories and ways to test what really makes this woman Captain Marvel. Basically, ''Captain Marvel'' is still a bad-ass comic that packs a hell of a punch – Sorry, I couldn’t help it."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Rice |first=Jamie |date=January 21, 2016 |title=CAPTAIN MARVEL #1 Review: Alpha Flight, Assemble! |url=https://comicsverse.com/captain-marvel-1-review-alpha-flight-assemble/ |website=[[ComicsVerse]]}}</ref> Jesse Schedeen of ''[[IGN]]'' gave ''Captain Marvel'' #1 a grade of 8.5 out of 10, writing, "If Carol Danvers' life has been all about flying higher and charging towards the horizon, her latest solo series offers a perfect new status quo. Carol is leaving the Avengers behind to spearhead the new Alpha Flight and serve as Earth's first line of defense against interstellar threats. The result is a new series that's less a traditional superhero book that an ensemble science-fiction tale. If anything, Captain Marvel reads like marvel's take on Star Trek or Battlestar Galactica. And that certainly has its appeals. [...] Captain Marvel is in good form as she kicks off her latest solo series. The new status quo is a logical extension of what's come before, and the ensemble cast injects new color into the mix. The creative team work seamlessly together to provide a clean, accessible and entertaining gateway into her world."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Schedeen |first=Jesse |date=2016-01-20 |title=Captain Marvel #1 Review |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/20/captain-marvel-1-review-4 |access-date=2022-08-03 |website=IGN |language=en}}</ref>

According to [[Diamond Comic Distributors]], ''Mighty Captain Marvel'' #1 was the 32nd best selling comic book in January 2017.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Top 100 Comics: January 2017 |url=http://www.diamondcomics.com/Article/190638-Top-100-Comics-January-2017 |access-date=2022-09-11 |website=www.diamondcomics.com |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Comichron: January 2017 Comic Book Sales to Comics Shops |url=https://www.comichron.com/monthlycomicssales/2017/2017-01.html |access-date=2022-09-11 |website=www.comichron.com}}</ref>

Leia Calderon of ''[[CBR.com]]'' called ''Captain Marvel'' #1 an "inventive take on Carol Danvers," saying, "The issue as a whole feels slightly graceless in that there is a lot happening all at once, but it shows a ton of promise as it deals with contemporary issues in a loving way. "The Mighty Captain Marvel" reads like a love letter to the character, and builds upon the foundation of Captain Marvel herself, while spinning a unique series for both new and longtime fans of the hero. From the looks of things, we will be seeing a lot of identity parallels as Captain Marvel refocuses and finds herself with both a shape-shifter using her likeness, and a television show skewering it for commercial consumption. The creative team is careful to not overwrite recent history or give us another introduction to a character we've grown to love, but instead give Carol a goal and  focus to help sharpen the character for the latest readers joining the Carol Corps. While this first issue didn't leave as strong of an impression as December's issue #0, there's tons in store for those of us who pick up this series."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Calderon |first=Leia |date=2017-02-22 |title=The Mighty Captain Marvel #1 Flies Harder, Further, Faster |url=https://www.cbr.com/review-the-mighty-captain-marvel-1-flies-harder-further-faster-following-civil-war-ii/ |access-date=2022-09-04 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref> ''[[IGN]]'' gave ''Captain Marvel'' #1 a grade of 6.2 out of 10, asserting, "It’s been some time since Kelly Sue DeConnick’s name last graced the title page of Captain Marvel, but with each new release her presence feels as constant as ever. It’s a fact that makes Carol Danvers latest debut, ''The Mighty Captain Marvel'' #1, feel at once both easily accessible and disappointingly familiar. Much like DeConnnick, new writer Margaret Stohl shows a clear and immediate understanding of Carol and what drives her, something that stands as particularity important given her drawn out role in Civil War II. In many ways this book reads as a return to basics. Carol still puts helping others before herself, to the point where she’s often at odds with the people she reports to in regards to how best to go about doing so. It’s a simple, if familiar, setup, and while this first issue won’t bowl over any readers, it’s a solidly constructed and character appropriate start. With artist Ramon Rosanas turning in a similarly strong debut, there’s plenty of time for this title to become as mighty as its title promise."<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Schedeen |first1=Jesse |last2=Marnell |first2=Blair |date=2017-01-19 |title=Comic Book Reviews for January 18, 2017 |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/19/comic-book-reviews-for-january-18-2017 |access-date=2022-09-04 |website=IGN |language=en}}</ref>

Joshua Davison of ''[[Bleeding Cool]]'' called ''Captain Marvel'' #1 a "heartfelt look at Carol Danvers's youth," saying, "''The Life of Captain Marvel #1'' gets points out the gate for not being a straight retelling of Carol Danvers's life. Such retellings of origin stories can quickly be tiresome and meandering, as they don't often have a central conflict beyond marching onwards to the hero's present. This retelling of Captain Marvel's origin centers the conflict on Joe Danvers's abuse and Carol having to face it while framing it with the fallout of her return home in the present. It's a clever way to handle the concept. [...] ''The Life of Captain Marvel #1'' is an emotional yet action-packed first foray into revisiting the youth and origins of Carol Danvers. The story is constructed and presented well, Carol is as awesome as ever, and the artwork is excellent. This one earns a recommendation with ease."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Davison |first=Joshua |date=2018-07-19 |title=Life of Captain Marvel #1 Review: A Heartfelt Look at Carol Danvers's Youth |url=https://bleedingcool.com/comics/life-of-captain-marvel-1-review/ |access-date=2022-08-03 |website=Bleeding Cool News And Rumors |language=en}}</ref> Matthew Aguilar of ''[[Comicbook.com|ComicBook.com]]'' said, "While this is an origin story, it isn't the typical kind, as most of this is actually set in the present. We see glimpses from her past through flashbacks, but they never overwhelm the current time narrative and also happen to be simply gorgeous thanks to artist Marguerite Sauvage. Her visual style gives a lovely juxtaposition to the current era visuals, which feature Carlos Pacheco on his A-Game. Take a glance at page 12 for all the evidence of that you'll ever need. Issue #1 is mostly grounded on Earth, but it does open up a bit to present an intriguing mystery. The imagery and dialogue involved are interesting on their own, but it's the relation to Carol's history and family that are the most engaging parts of the mystery. Perhaps the issue's biggest achievement is just how new-reader friendly it is. Whether it was as Ms. Marvel, Binary, Warbird, Captain Marvel, or just Carol Danvers, the character has had quite the complicated history. So far though ''Life of Captain Marvel'' is turning a more personal eye to Carol's life and origins, and this approach allows for any fan, longtime or new, to pick it up with ease. It remains to be seen if ''Life of Captain Marvel'' will deliver on its potential, but the book is certainly off to an amazing start. ''The Life of Captain Marvel'' #1 embraces what Captain Marvel has become, both as a character and as a hero in fans' eyes, and it's a story you don't want to miss."<ref>{{Cite web |title=Review: 'Life of Captain Marvel' #1 Builds a Better Hero From the Past |url=https://comicbook.com/marvel/news/life-of-captain-marvel-1-review/ |access-date=2022-09-11 |website=Marvel |language=en}}</ref>

Chase Magnett of ''[[Comicbook.com|ComicBook.com]]'' gave ''Marvel Super Hero Adventures: Captain Marvel'' #1 a grade of 4 out of 5, stating, "The newest entry in this young readers line at Marvel Comics makes some notable improvements. The framing device in which more realistically portrayed characters is gone, making it easier to remain focused on this cartoonish and fun romp. An added middle segment with spoofs of classic comic strips makes for a nice break in terms of reading and the adults likely reading these comic to their children. The adventure itself is easily followed and filled with plenty of gags and big action to capture anyone's attention for 20 pages. It is both an improvement and a solid standard for superhero comics aimed at capturing those just learning to read any media."<ref>{{Cite web |title=Comic Book Reviews for This Week: 9/19/2018 |url=https://comicbook.com/comics/news/comic-book-reviews-marvel-dc-image/ |access-date=2022-09-11 |website=Comics |language=en}}</ref>

Mike Fugere of ''[[CBR.com]]'' described ''Captain Marvel'' #1 as a "solid groundwork for something with the potential to be really special," stating, "''Captain Marvel'' #1 may not be the most complex and thrilling debut Carol Danvers has ever starred in, but it’s a lot of fun. [[Kelly Thompson|Thompson]] and Carnero have crafted some solid groundwork for something with the potential to be really special. The sudden shift at the end of this issue is exactly why we read comics in the first place, after all.

The story tries to set up plenty of events that will surely prove to be significant in upcoming issues. However, at times, that “setting up” process feels clunky. Despite that, Thompson does a great job reintroducing Carol following the events of ''The Life of Captain Marvel''.She also does an excellent job in previewing an adventure that has the potential to be truly epic.

She's grown past her Ms. Marvel days and into an icon and powerhouse in the upper echelon of Marvel heroes, but the same normal human being is at the center, and this couldn't be a better reminder of why we fell in love with her in the first place. Thompson and company's Captain Marvel brings all the elements you loved about Carol and adds a few new wrinkles of her own. That would be enough to win us over, but then she goes and turns the book on its head by issue's end, paving a new path that holds even more compelling possibilities for our favorite hero. This is the best of the old and the new, and while you might come for the Carol you used to know, you'll end up staying for the revolutionary who's yet to come"<ref>{{Cite web |title=Comic Book Reviews for This Week: 1/9/2019 |url=https://comicbook.com/comics/news/new-comic-reviews-dc-marvel-image-254633/ |access-date=2022-09-11 |website=Comics |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Review: 'Captain Marvel' #1 Proves Carol's Star Has Never Been Brighter |url=https://comicbook.com/marvel/news/captain-marvel-1-review/ |access-date=2022-09-11 |website=Marvel |language=en}}</ref>

Marvel Comics.</ref> In ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', she works on apprehending [[Alternative versions of the Green Goblin#Ultimate Marvel|Norman Osborn]] after he escapes from the Triskelion.<ref name="Ultimate Spider-Man #111-117">''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #111–117. Marvel Comics.</ref> Things got difficult for her when Norman lied to the press that S.H.I.E.L.D. wrongly imprisoned him for trying to make the world a safer place, putting the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents out of a job.<ref name="Ultimate Spider-Man #111-117"/>

She receives help from [[Spider-Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Spider-Man]] (Peter Parker) after she arrests him in public, hoping that it would lure Norman to her. She summoned a press release and had [[Harry Osborn]] tell the reporters the truth that Norman was a horrible person for experimenting on himself and killing his mother.<ref name="Ultimate Spider-Man #111-117"/> Outraged, Norman went to the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier and attacked his son along with her, Spider-Man, and the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents on board. Norman accidentally killed Harry and, feeling guilty, tells the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents to kill him.

When Loki attempted another invasion of Earth, Danvers and the women of the team ([[Power Princess|Zarda]] and [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]]) were placed under a spell by [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Amora]]. Danvers, using technology, was able to resist the spell and was able to free the rest of the team to battle Loki's forces.<ref>''New Ultimates'' #1–6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After Spider-Man was captured and replaced by the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]], Danvers decided that having Peter, untrained, loose in the city was doing more harm than good. She approached [[Aunt May|May Parker]] and they both agreed that Peter would attend training lessons from individual members of the New Ultimates.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #150. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Danvers and her New Ultimates battled Nick Fury and his Avengers while each side accused the other of being traitors to S.H.I.E.L.D. and the United States of America. During the fight, Danvers was hit by a Police Cruiser, leaving her in critical condition. Her role as S.H.I.E.L.D. Director was then passed on to [[Gregory Stark]], the one that had in fact engineered the events from the start.<ref>''Avengers vs New Ultimates'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> After Stark is killed, Fury replaced Danvers as director.<ref>''Avengers vs New Ultimates'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>
