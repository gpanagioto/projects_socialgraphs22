Hey, if you boys are building a clubhouse you should start with the floor. A ladder to heaven? Why, son? That's the ...s-s-saddest thing I've ever heard. The boys wanna see their dead friend Kenny again, Jimbo, so they're... building a ladder to heaven. ''No'', it's... alright, Sheila. The boys were just... building a ladder to heaven to see their old friend, Kenny. Well, our son just said to us that he really needed to see his little friend Kenny again and... and that he thought it would work...  if he... built the ladder to heaven.  No! Agh, look, I, I think maybe this has gone on far enough. Boys, it's really neat that you want to see your old pal Kenny so much but... When you die, your body is put into a broiling oven and cooked until you're nothing but ashes.  The person's ashes are put into an urn, and that's where Kenny's body is. What?  Oh God, and we told our boys they'd never reach heaven. If Saddam is building weapons, we have to stop him. With our weapons.  Wait, are you saying that you boys only wanted to build a ladder to heaven so you could get some candy?? No, no. We shouldn't bomb anybody. These boys are right. The only heaven we can hope for is one here on earth, now. We should stop waiting to get into heaven and start trying to... create it.
