An aquarium at Sea Park, Denver, day. The aquarium is full of spectators in stadium seats looking on as a whale goes about its routine.

Brian

And now, Jambu is going to going to give you all a big wave! [the whale rolls to the right and smacks one of its fins on the water, which splashes onto the audience. The crowd ooos and ahhs. A wave of water hits the boys, who are sitting in the front row.]

Cartman

I'm all wet! Sweet!

Kyle

Dude, Jambu is the best! [Jambu returns and takes a quick dive towards the bottom of its tank.]

Brian

Now get ready for Jambu's next trick. [Jambu leaps up into the air, performs a somersault, and strikes the water with its fluke, again sending water onto the boys]

Cartman

Haha! I'm totally wet! This is awesome!!

Brian

[shown as a brunet, with long sideburns] How about that, folks! A full body flip! And now, Kelly's gonna show us how she makes Jambu do his tricks. [a blonde woman in a wet suit steps forward, kneels down by the edge of the small dock she's on, and strikes the water three times with her hand] When Kelly slaps her hand three times, Jambu comes to her. Jambu will stay and wait until Kelly gives him a command. [she signals for him to go forward, and she dives in after him] Oh, what trick are we gonna see? Get those cameras ready! [Kelly dives and gets into position. Jambu circles the tank, then returns and pops up out of the water with Kelly on his nose. She then waves her arms signaling she's fine.] That's Kelly riding on Jambu's nose! [aside, to his partner Mike in the booth] I wish Kelly would ride on my nose. [they both laugh. Jambu drops a bit and Kelly dives off his nose. Jambu splashes the crown once more.]

Cartman

Yes! Yeehehehes! [Jambu returns with Kelly on his nose as if she were a hood ornament]

Brian

We hope you enjoyed Jambu's orca show, and enjoy the rest of your day at Denver's Sea Park! [clicks off his mic] You bunch of retards. [Mike laughs. Everyone begins to clear the small stadium]

Stan

[reading the park map] Okay, where to next?

Cartman

I think there's a sea lion show at 2:30.

Kyle

Let's just stay here and watch the whale swim around some more.

Cartman

Why?

Kyle

Dude, everyone's leaving! We can walk right up to the tank and really study him.

Cartman

Kyle, the show is over! The whale isn't gonna splash us any more, so who cares?

Stan

Let's go see the stingrays, and then we can go to the sea lion show.

Cartman

Killer. [the boys turn and leave]

Kyle

I'll meet up with you guys in a little bit. I-I wanna hang out here some more.

Cartman

Okay, Kyle. We're gonna get splashed some more, but if you wanna go make love to the whale, that's fine. [turns to catch up with Stan and Kenny. Kyle walks around the tank]

Kyle

Jambu? Jambu? [taps the glass wall four times. Jambu dives and floats up facing Kyle] Cool! It worked! Hey, Jambu.

Jambu

Hello, little boy. [Kyle is awed that the whale could talk] Do you like my flippers?

Kyle

[a little scared, looks around] Who said that?

Jambu

I did.

Kyle

No way!

Jambu

This is very exciting! Usually when I talk, nobody can hear me. Where are you from?

Kyle

[timidly] South Park.

Jambu

It sure is nice to have somebody to talk to. Can't we talk more? Please?

Kyle

What do you wanna talk about?

Jambu

Let's talk about rocket ships.

Kyle

Rocket ships?

Jambu

[it's actually Brian, still in his booth] Yeah. I love rockets, but I can't see them 'cause I'm stuck in this tank. [he and Mike both laugh, then he shushes Mike and returns to the mic]. You know, someday, I wish that I could go up in space in a rocket ship.

Kyle

Why? Aren't you happy here?

Jambu

I try to be, but my wish is to one day blast off in a big rocket ship!

Kyle

This is amazing! But wait right here. I've gotta go tell my friends about this! [the two men in the booth are laughing their asses off]

Jambu

Oh God, it's funny every single time. [Mike continues laughing]

+++++


At another exhibit in the park.

Stingray Announcer

And for those of you just joining us, this is the stingray tank. Stingrays are members of the shark family, but they're extremely peaceful creatures. We invite you to gently touch the top of them as they swim by.

Cartman

[slapping the water as a stingray approaches] Heh! Come on, stingray! [it speeds away. Another one approaches] Splash me! Ha! Hey, splash me! [it speeds away as well] Dude, these things are dumb. Let's go!

Kyle

[running up to the other boys] Hey you guys! You guys are not gonna believe this!

Stan

What?

Kyle

Dude, he talks! The orca whale talks!

Kenny

(What the fuck are you talking about?)

Kyle

I went up to Jambu's tank and I tapped three times like the trainer did. Jambu swam up and started talking to me about rocket ships! Come on! You gotta check it out! [runs back towards Jambu's exhibit, grinning]

+++++


Jambu's exhibit, Orca Ocean.

Kyle

Jambu! Jambu, I'm back! [hits the wall four times, and Jambu swims around, stopping in front of Kyle again] How are you feeling? [no reply. A few seconds later...] Huhm. Jambu, you wanna talk about rocket ships? [Brian is playing a video game, Mike is reading a book - Mother Trucker.] Ja- Jambu? Are you still feelin' lonely here?

Cartman

Kyle, Kyle. Let it go, man.

Kyle

He talked! I swear to Abraham he talked, and he loves rocket ships!

Mike

[noticing the commotion] Dude, he's back, he's back! [the two men get ready]

Kyle

Goddammit, say something!

Cartman

Come on, guys, let's leave Kyle with his stupid whale.

Jambu

[Cartman stops in his tracks] Please don't call me stupid.

Kyle

Jambu! Jambu, why didn't you speak up before?

Jambu

I'm sorry. Sometimes I can't talk. It's because I'm very very sick, you see.

Kyle

Sick?

Stan

I don't believe it.

Jambu

Yes, because I'm not used to the earth atmosphere. You see, my name is actually Willzy-x, and I'm from the moon! [Brian clicks off his mic, Mike laughs, and they both crack up]

Mike

The moon?

Jambu

The... that's where all orca whales are from. If I don't get back to the moon, I'm going to die.

Cartman

You live on the moon?

Jambu

I used to. I wish I could return and dance in the moon castle with my wife and three children again.

Kyle

Oh my God...

Stan

Why don't you just tell the people here at the sea park?

Jambu

I can't tell them, because they're evil communists from the Horsehead Nebula. They want to kill all us zypods, so they keep us in these horrible tanks and make us perform.

Kyle

That's terrible!

Mike

Dude, dude, the boss is coming!

Jambu

Uh, uh, sorry boys, I can't talk anymore. I'm too sick. [coughs] Can't. Talk. Any. More. [coughs. The boys stand there, stunned]

+++++


Kyle's house, basement.

Kyle

Alright guys, listen up! This may sound a little strange, but, the whale, at the Denver Sea Park, is going to die, unless we get it to the moon,

Butters

Well okay! Let's do it!

Kyle

The whale's name is Willzy-x, and he told us he's dying on our planet. We've come up wth a plan, but we're gonna need all of your help to make it work.

Clyde

...A whale. Talked to you.

Stan

It's true. The whale talked to all of us. In between shows at his orca tank.

Craig

Hey, that whale talked to me too. After everyone left the show I walked up to the glass and he started talking.

Kyle

Weh-well, why didn't you tell anybody?

Craig

Well I thought I was crazy. He said my dad was gonna sneak into my room naked one night and beat me up.

Kyle

Well you're NOT crazy. The whale talked to all of us. And he needs our help getting him home.

Craig

...So it's true.

Kyle

Nobody else is going to help him, you guys. We've got a chance to do something pretty special here. Are you with us?

Tolkien

...What do we do?

Kyle

Stan? [Stan rises and approaches the easel]

Stan

All right. In order to make our plan work, we're going to need the pool from Clyde's back yard, Timmy's wheelchair, the Russian government, and all of our skateboards.

+++++


Denver Sea Park, night. The boys arrive at the park. A security guard whistles as he patrols the grounds. Behind him a wheelchair is heard. He pulls out a flashlight and swings it around to highlight everywhere he looks. Timmy and the gang roll by quietly, the pool riding on the skateboards.

Timmy

[softly] Timmihhhhh... [The guard looks back just after they pass by, so he just missed them. The boys reach Jambu's tank]

Stan

Craig, Token, get the slings ready. [Cartman, Clyde, and a third boy position a ladder into place. Jambu swims over to see what's happening.]

Kyle

Shhh. Willzy-x, don't say anything. We're gonna bust you out of here.

+++++


Denver Sea Park, morning. Brian and Mike arrive at work.

Brian

Dude, did you see that episode of Trading Spouses last night? That was insane. Yeah, well ha- whoa. What the hell? [people mill around by Jambu's tank. Police officers move about. The park's owner talks to the guard]

Owner

How could you not have seen anything?? It's a whale, for Christ's sake!

Guard

It must have been taken while I was going to the bathroom.

Owner

Were you in there for three hours?!

Guard

[hurt, turns away and shields himself] Don't yell at me! [Brianand Mike arrive from the booth]

Brian

What happened?

Kelly

Somebody kidnapped Jambu, took him right out of the park.

Mike

What? How?

Guard

[raises his head up long enough to say] I DON'T KNOW!

Sergeant

All right, people, it's obvious we're dealing with a highly intelligent animal-rights group. Those bastards have done stuff like this before.

Nelson

Sir! Sir, we've found a note!

Owner

A note? Let me see that. [reads the note] We're taking Willzy-x home to the moon. Long live the zypods! [the duo instantly realize who stole Jambu] What the hell does that mean?

Sergeant

Harris, run a fingerprint on that note! [hands the note to Harris] Nelson! Find out what kind of crayon it was written with. [Nelson leaves] We'll find out who was responsible for this! [the duo know the jig is up]

+++++


The Orca Ocean booth. The duo are inside. Brian paces the floor.

Mike

We have to tell them! We know what those boys look like!

Brian

We can't tell them, then they're, they're gonna think this is all our fault

Mike

It IS all our fault!

Brian

How were we supposed to know that they were gonna actually do it?!

Mike

I shouldn't have laughed. All those times we've messed with those kids' heads, I shouldn't have just sat there and laughed.

Brian

[grabs him by the arms] Don't you say that! It was funny! It was really funny! We've just... [lets him go] we've just gotta make this right ourselves.

Mike

How?

Brian

We've gotta track down those kids. Before the police do!

+++++


Moscow, day, the Kremlin. Inside, Putin and members of his staff meet in a boardroom.

Putin

Comrades, I'm afraid our situation is dire. The economy is stale and I... Very soon, Mother Russia... will no longer be a country.

Aide

Sir! Sir, somebody is on telephone! Another rich American wants to fly into space! [silence, then everyone rushes into Putin's office]

Putin

Hello? Hello, this is Russian President.

Kyle

Hi. My name's Kyle. Uh, I understand that your country flies people into space for money.

Putin

Yes, we certainly do! [holds his left thumb up for the others to see] What were you looking for?

Kyle

I need to book one trip to the moon, please. Right away.

Putin

The moon. That is quite large trip, but I'm sure we can do it!

Kyle

You can? Awesome!

Putin

It sounds like we're in business! We will just need, say, twenty million dollars?

Kyle

[lowers the phone with some disbelief] Twenty... million? [raises the phone to his ear again] Are you nuts? We don't have that kind of money.

Putin

...What?

Kyle

But you need to understand: we have a whale here that needs to get back to his family on the moon.

Putin

Goddamnit it is prank call again! [his staff leaves] Kiss my ass, George Bush! This is not funny! [slams the phone onto the base]

Stan

What happened?

Kyle

They want twenty million dollars.

Cartman

Twenty million? Just to go to the dumb moon?

Craig

That was it? That was you guys' whole plan? Ask the Russians to take the whale to space?

Stan

They were going to do it for that 'N Sync guy.

Tweek

Oh, Jesus, now what are we gonna do?!

Kyle

All right, look, there's gotta be other Third-World countries with space programs. We've gotta split up and find someplace cheaper, that's all.

Clyde

Well we can't keep the whale out here anymore, people are gonna see it!

+++++


Channel 4 News Break.

Anchor Tom

A beloved performing orca whale has been stolen from the Denver Sea Park. A full investigation is underway, but tracking down the kidnappers is proving to be one WHALE of a problem.

Field reporter

Thanks, Tom, I'm here at the Denver Sea Park where, believe it or not, dozens of people have come to show support for whoever took the whale. [a crowd of protesters begin to chant]

ALF leader

That's right. We are members of the Animal Liberation Front! Whales do not belong in tanks, they belong in the ocean! We applaud whoever did this noble deed! Set the whales free!

Protesters

Set the whales free!

Field reporter

One thing for certain: something is certainly FISHY here at the Sea Park. Tom?

Anchor Tom

Thank, Mitch. It seems that this problem is almost un-BEAR-able. [no one says a word] Let's hope that whale is found.

+++++


Brian and Mike arrive in South Park in a truck with a tank-trailer.

Mike

This is so bad, man. How do we even know this is the right town to look in??

Brian

Will you relax? Those kids said they were from South Park. We've just gotta go door to door. Do you have the composite sketch we did?

Mike

[holds up a sheet of paper] Yeah.

Brian

Let's go! [they exit the truck and face the houses on one side of the street]

Mike

Maybe you should start with the houses on the left, a-and I'll take the-

Brian

[stops him] Wait a minute. Check that out! [before them is a big pool in a backyard. The fence, which normally blocks off the view from the street, is destroyed, and tracks go through the gap all the way to the pool] Come on! [they move towards the pool and walk up the steps. Brian grabs some crap floating on the surface and shows it to Mike] Oh my good, look!

Mike

Whale poo.

Brian

We're close. We're really close!

Mrs. Donovan

[the sliding door opens] Can I help you?

Brian

[drops the poo quickly and turns to face her] Oh... h-hello ma'am. We're just here to examine your pool.

Mrs. Donovan

Oh.

Mike

Have you noticed any whales in your pool at all?

Mrs. Donovan

No, I don't believe so. But we've been out of town for a couple of days and came back to find the fence broken. Do you think somebody's been using it?

Brian

Ma'am, do you recognize any of these boys? [Mike hands her the sketch. She takes it and studies it]

Mrs. Donovan

The fat one in the middle... kinda looks like Dakota Fanning. Excuse me, gentlemen, I have to get back to the oven. [hands the sketch back to the Mike]

Mike

[turns around, getting exasperated] We're too late. They've moved on to another town!

Brian

We don't know that!

Mike

If they've moved on, then we have no leads! This is fate, Brian! It's fate! For telling the kids their naked dads were gonna beat them up! For thinking that screwing with kids was funny!

Brian

[grabs his Mike and shakes him] It WAS funny!! It was funny, Bob! And it will be funny again, I swear to you! If those boys took the whale out of here, we would have seen them on the road! I'm telling you, we're close. It's going to be funny!

+++++


Kyle's house, day. His parents are at his bedroom door with Ike.

Sheila

[knocks three times] Kyle bubbe, we're taking Ike to the new Harry Potter movie. Wanna join us?

Kyle

I can't, Mom. We're working on our school project.

Sheila

All right. Well, there's pizza in the fridge if you and your friends get hungry. [Gerald goes down the stairs with Ike as she speaks, then she turns away and goes down the stairs]

Kyle

Okay ma, thanks! [behind him is Jambu, and the other boys are keeping him moist]

Butters

Shouldn't we get him back in the water?

Clyde

Whales are mammals; they don't need water to breathe, dumb-ass.

Cartman

Yeah, we just have to keep him wet.

Kyle

Yes, yes, hello? Is this Mr. Su-gi-yama with the Japanese space program? [waits for the answer] How much to take a whale into space? [waits for the answer] Nu-no, we don't want you to eat the whale, we want you to send it to the moon. How much? Jesus Christ! Uh hang on. [puts Mr. Sugiyama on hold as he answers another call] Hello? Jimmy, any luck at the Chinese Embassy?

Jimmy

[with Timmy and Tweek] The Ch-Chinese will take someone to space for t-t-ten million dollars.

Kyle

Ten million?? Well that's more than the Germans want!

Jimmy

Yeah. We told them that, a-and they told us to go f-fruck ourselves.

Kyle

Damnit! [hangs up without returning to Mr. Sugiyama] Tell me what to do, Willzy-x! How do we get you home??

Cartman

He hasn't said a word since we brought him here.

Kyle

Yeah... He must be really sick. [walks up to the whale and strokes him] Hang on Willzy-x. There's still hope. Stan and Craig might still luck with the space program down in Mexico.

Clyde

Mexico has a space program?

+++++


Mexico. A view of the coast is first seen. Then, in a downtown area, a bus lets Stan and Craig out and leaves. Stan follows the directions on a map, and eventually end up in front of Jose's Ceramica Y Fuentes. A man is sitting by the entrance next to a fountain.

Stan

Uh, excuse me, we're looking for the Mexican... [enunciates] Aeronautica y Spacia Administra-tio-n?

Man

Allí. ("There") [points down the road]

Stan

Thanks. [they leave and arrive at MASA - Mexicana Aeronáuti'co y Spacia Administración]

+++++


MASA - Mexicana Aeronáuti'co y Spacia Administración. Within the chain link fence, there are a few buildings, along with abandoned appliances, oil barrels and a gass pump and several men either standing or sitting around and relaxing. One man, Mannuel, is by the entrance and appears to be cleaning a rocket part as Stan and Craig appear.

Stan

Is this the Mexican space program? [again, neglected beauty, and the place looks quite primitive for a space administration, straight out of the 1950s.]

Mannuel

Space, sí ("Yes"). Fly [Gestures flying upward with his left hand].

Stan

Does the Mexican space programs have rockets that can go to the moon?

Mannuel

Claro. Sígueme. ("Sure. Follow me") [sets down the part he was cleaning and goes inside the complex. The boys follow him]

+++++


MASA - Mexicana Aeronáuti'co y Spacia Administración. Inner complex. Along with more garbage and abandoned cars, there are three rockets lined up to be launched. The rockets are near a boat dock.

Mannuel

De rocket lunar? ("The space rocket?")

Stan

This rocket will fly to the moon?

Mannuel

Sí ("Yes"). Fly [Gestures flying upward with his left hand].

Stan

To the moon?

Mannuel

Sí.

Stan

[enunciates] We want to take something to the moon. How much would that cost?

Man 2

O-ah... Two hundred.

Stan

Two hundred? Million?

Man 2

Two hundred... dollars.

Stan

[to Craig] Quick, call Kyle.

+++++


The Broflovski house, day. Sheila is cleaning a lamp table next to the sofa when the doorbell rings. She goes to answer it.

Brian

Eh hello ma'am, uh, the teacher at the school said she recognized this boy to be your son? [Sheila takes the composite sketch and looks at Kyle's image]

Sheila

Oh yes, that's my bubbe. Kind of a bad drawing though.

Brian

Ma'am, we need to talk to your son, please! It's very urgent!

Sheila

I'm sorry, he just left. He's on his way to Mexico.

Both men

Mexico??

Sheila

Yehhs. As part of a school project, he's helping his class to move two donated grand pianos to needy school children in Tijuana. My little bubbe is very caring.

Mike

Oh my God.

Brian

Which highway did they take??

+++++


On the highway during the day, a truck zips along. Kenny, Clyde, Cartman, and Butters ride in the cab with the driver, Kyle is in the trailer with Willzy-x, keeping him moist with damp clothes.

Cartman

Hurry it up, dude, we have a rocket to catch.

Kyle

Hang on, Willzy-x. Hang on, buddy.

+++++


The highway, night. The truck keeps rolling.

Cartman

We have to hurry!

Driver

I'm going as fast as I can.

Kyle

Hang on, Willzy-x. We'll in Mexico soon!.

Butters

Oh hamburgers! What is that?? [The Denver Sea Park truck appears before them and blocks their way, so the driver stops. Brian steps out of the Sea Park truck. Mike joins him and they both stand before the Moovit truck until it stops, then they move to the driver's side door]

Brian

All right, out of the truck!

Cartman

Uh oh.

Driver

What the hell is goin' on?!

Brian

You're carrying a stolen whale!

Driver

Stolen? You kids told me you won that whale at Pizza Hut!

Clyde

We're busted. [Brian and Mike roll up the trailer and Kyle looks]

Kyle

Huh?

Brian

Come on out, kid. [the four other boys walk around Brian and stop]

Driver

Look, I didn't know nothin' about this.

Brian

Just help us get the whale into our truck and we'll all keep quiet about this.

Kyle

You don't understand! Willzy-x is from the moon! He'll die if we don't get him back, now! Willzy-x, you have to talk! Come on boy, you have to! I know you're sick, but you could do it!

Mike

Look, kid, we need to tell you a little secret. [a bright light comes on and a police siren sounds. They all turn to see who it is. Two motorcycle cops get off their bikes.]

Cop 1

What's goin' on here??

Brian

Aw crap.

Butters

Oh, now we're gonna get it.

Cop 1

Hey... That's the stolen whale!

Cop 2

Everyone down on the ground. Now!

Kyle

No! Please, we have to go!

Cop 2

You're not goin' anywhere! You're in a lot of trouble! [the first cop starts making arrests]

Kyle

But... we were so close... I'm sorry, Willzy-x. We tried.

Cop 1

We said down on the ground, kid. Move it! [three gunshots come out of nowhere, and everyone turns to see whom it could be now.]

ALF leader

Leave those kids alone, you bastards! Animal Liberation Front! [the ALF members growl]

Cop 1

Put down that weapon, now!

ALF leader

These boys are trying to get that whale home! You're not gonna stop them!

Kyle

All right!!

The Other Boys

Yes! Wow!

Cop 2

That whale belongs to a sea park!

Kyle

It belongs with its family!

ALF member

That's right!

Cop 1

I said drop the gun NOW!

ALF leader

Save the whale! [fires her gun and charges. The other ALF members charge and fire as well. Cop 2 is hit and falls. Cop 1 fires back. The boys hide behind the Moovit! truck]

Mike

Jesus, Oh God! [he's soon riddled with bullet holes and falls over]

ALF member

Save the whales, motherfucker!

ALF leader

[fires a few more rounds over the boys' heads as she positions herself behind them] Where are you taking the whale?

Kyle

Tijuana, Mexico!

ALF leader

Of course. Brilliant! Release it in international waters. I'll drive the truck. [she and the boys get into the cab, Kyle stays in the trailer with the whale]

Kyle

You're going home, Willzy-x! [the truck drives away, and Brian crawls over to Mike]

Brian

Mike? Mike??

Mike

[still has enough life in him to cough and say] It... wasn't... funny...

Brian

Don't say that, Mike. It was funny. It just wasn't that funny this time. [Mike's head drops] All the other times were still funny, Mike! They were still funny!!

Cop 1

[crawls to his bike and grabs a radio] Forty-five to dispatch... Stolen whale... heading to Tijuana... Whaaale to Tijuana!! [falls]

+++++


MASA, night. Workers get the rocket to the moon ready. They connect chains to the body.

Worker 1

Conecte la segunda cadena. ["Connect the second chain."]

Worker 2

No sé si va a llegar. ["I don't know if it'll reach."]

Stan

They're on their way, Manuel. Is the rocket gonna be ready?

Manuel

Sí ("Yes"). Fly [Gestures flying upward with his left hand].

+++++


The highway, night. The Moovit! truck is now accompanied by an ALF van.

Butters

Look! The Mexican border!

Clyde

Oh Jesus, they're here!

+++++


U.S. Customs / Mexico Boarder Checkpoint. The sign reveals that they are in Arizona and about to enter into Mexico. The Park County cops are blocking the checkpoint and have their guns pointed.

Sergeant

Hold your positions! [a police helicopter comes down. The owner of the sea park and the orca trainers step down from it, along with the security guard]

Owner

Aha! We've got them!

ALF leader

Hang on, boys.

Owner

Mary Mother of God! [the Moovit! truck barrels through the helicopter and blockade. Everyone in the way jumps out of the way. The Moovit! truck is now in Mexico]

Sergeant

[lying face down, points at the truck] Get them!

+++++


MASA, later. The Moovit! truck rolls in.

Kyle

Willzy-x, I think we're here.

Stan

[to the ALF leader] Back down the ramp! It's all rigged to go!

ALF leader

You got it, kid! [makes a quick right, then backs up left and towards the end of the dock]

Owner

[arriving at MASA with the guard and trainers] Don't let them get that whale in the water! [Kyle rolls open the trailer door]

Stan

Kyle, it's all set to go! [the ALF van rolls in] Just get Willzy-x into the water! [some ALF officers emerge from the van.]

Kyle

Come on, guys! [Craig, Clyde, Kenny, Butters, and Cartman show up. Clyde and Kenny jump up and pull the ramp down]

Owner

[starts to run in with the guard and trainers] Stop right now!

ALF leader

Hurry, boys! We'll take care of them! [The zoo personnel and the ALF face off, with the ALF landing the first blows. Kelly goes down like a statue. At the dock, the boys struggle to move Willzy-x into the water]

Kyle

Hang on. [looks around] Hold on a second. [steps down into the water and addresses Willzy-x] I gues... I... guess... this is... goodbye, Willzy-x. [the whale opens his mouth. Kyle begins to tear up] I'm gonna miss you. [Butters and Clyde tear up and look at each other] Hey, don't forget me, okay? I won't forget you. [sniffs a bit, then pets the whale.]

Cartman

Oh crap! There's more of them! [police cruisers pour in and officers pour out of them]

Kyle

Get him in the water! [the boys pull Willzy-x once more, with a mighty pull] Goodbye, Willzy-x! [the whale takes to the water and the ALF cheers a job well done]

ALF leader

Swim, mighty whale! You're free!

Stan

Okay, Manuel, hit it. [Manuel presses the launch button]

Owner

[advances with the guard and police] Stop! That is my whale!

ALF leader

I'm afraid you're too late! The whale's been set free.

Owner

No!

ALF leader

Now you see that your ways of captivity and exploiting animals will never prevail. [behind her, a rocket rises into launch position] Not as long as there are children like these who still believe in the beauty and magic of freedom. [The park owner, guard, police, and now FBI gawk at her, or at the rocket behind her.] For it is children, with their innocence and their spirit, who know what is truly best for all the world.

+++++


the rocket is now in position. The rocket powers up and now she hears it. She and the ALF turn to see the rocket rise out of its base. Behind it are the chains, attached to a sling below water holding Willzy-x. The chains tighten and lift Willzy-x up and away. The boys grin big.

ALF leader

Oh my God!

Kyle

We did it!

+++++


the boys cheer, congratulate each other, and dance. The Mexican launch crew does so as well. A mariachi band appears out of nowhere for the celebration and plays the Mexican anthem. On the US side of the border, Brian looks up to see the rocket rise into space with Willzy-x trailing along in the sling. He laughs weakly.

+++++


South Park, night. Manuel has driven the boys back to town in the Moovit! truck and lets them off in their neighborhood.

Stan

Thanks for the ride, Manuel.

Manuel

Sí, bye. [closes the door and drives off]

Butters

Well, see ya, fellas. Uh I've gotta get home before my parents wake up.

Clyde

Yeah, me too. [Craig goes off as well]

Kyle

All right. Thanks for your help, dudes. [the boys walk towards Kyle's house, but Kyle stops] Well, we did it, guys. It wasn't easy, but... we did a really amazing thing.

Cartman

Yeah, I feel pretty awesome right now. [Stan looks at the sky and steps forward. The other boys join him. Before them, up in the sky, is the full moon, bright and nicely detailed]

Stan

I wonder... if he'll ever come back and visit us.

Kyle

I don't know, but at least from now on, every time we look at the moon, we can know that Willzy-x is up there, dancing with the other zypods in his castle.

A shot of the moon, with the Earth in the distance. On the ground lies Willzy-x, motionless.
