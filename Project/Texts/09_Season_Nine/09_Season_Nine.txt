Hello, Mr. Garrison, I'm Dr. Biber. I'll be performing your surgery today. ...an abortion? Mmister Garrison- Mmrs. Garrison, you can't have an abortion. No, I mean you're physically unable to have an abortion, because you can't get pregnant. You can't have periods either.  You had a sex change, Mr. Garrison, but you don't have ovaries or a womb. You don't produce eggs. N-that's right. Basically, yes. Then that's it! We brought him back. Call the parents. They're going to be shocked to find out... their son is alive. It's the latest in electro-plastilical science. Your son's organs are all functioning again. I'm afraid he can't respond to you. You see, being dead for that long, most of Kenny's brain cells died from lack of oxygen. Your son is alive, but, in what we call a "persistent vegetative state." I'm afraid no. Brain cells cannot be repaired once dead. But his soul is still in here.  Almost... trapped in here, if you will. Kenny is the same as he ever was. It's just that, now, he's more like ...a tomato. A feeding tube. It pumps a nutrient paste directly into Kenny's stomach. With it we can actually keep Kenny the tomato alive for years. He can't respond to you, boys. Being dead for that long caused severe damage to his brain.  But this just doesn't seem right. I'm afraid I've been given a court order to remove Kenny's feeding tube. I'm sorry. I have no choice.  Your son is suffering from severe dementia. He claims that the ghost of a dead friend talks to him. This is usually a sign of schizophrenia brought on by some tragic event in the child's past. I think it's best that we take him to the mental center and do some tests.  Just stay perfectly still now, Butters. Good. You're gonna feel a little pinch now, Butters.  Well, after fourteen hours of testing, I can say Butters is definitely suffering from aggravated repressed memory syndrome. You see, Butters, when the brain wants to cover something up, it makes up images and sounds for you to hear. Good. We're making a lot of headway. We'll do some more testing tomorrow. All right, folks. Let's let Butters get some rest.  Well, all his vital signs are still normal. From his outward appearance, I would say he has the standard skin pigment deficiency. Yes, I'm afraid that your son is suffering from gingervitus. Well, the red-haired and freckle gene is a recessive gene. It must've stayed dormant in your system until you hit adolescence.  Ms. Cartman, I know this must be... very difficult for you. I for one can't stand red-haired, freckled kids, but you need to understand, there is no cure. Your son will be ginger his whole life. You might want to just... put him down. All right, but... you're gonna have to take certain precautions now. It's very important that you keep Eric out of the sun. The sun... is his worst enemy.  God bless you, Doctor. I know you'll make me well again. My whole life I've been a woman trapped in a man's body. A sex-change operation is my last chance at happiness. Ough, ergh. Eww.  So long, balls.  Oh, that stings. OH! Oh jeez. Do I look like a woman? Now, you're absolutely sure you want a vaginoplasty? All right, then let's begin.  With the scrotum open, I can now discard of your testicles. Now, I'll just continue the incision up the shaft of the penis.  Now, I'll just... turn your... penis inside out. All we need to do now is ...stuff the ...unskinned penis inside your... pelvis... And now I'll use the skin from your penis to make vaginal lips.  Pretty much. So, I hear you're interested in reconstructive surgery. Oh yes, Mr. Garrison. Uh yes, he had a vaginoplasty. Mhm. Sure. You see sometimes a woman wants to be a man. That procedure is called a peniplasty. ...You what?  Ohhhhh! You want a negroplasty! It's a fairly common procedure, really, just the reverse of a caucasioplasty just like Michael Jackson had. Let's take a look here.  Negroplasty takes about seven hours and costs roughly three thousand dollars. Well, it's a good idea if you wanna be tall and black. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it. Dr. Biber.  Oh, you're Kyle's father. What is that on your shirt? Ahhh you like dolphins, hm?  I can make you one. Invert the back, move the esophagus to the top of the head. Yes, a full dolphinoplasty could be achieved relatively simply... There's nothing crazy about a person wanting to look on the outside the way they feel on the inside. Excuse me, I'm performing an operation here! I gave you a sex change. Mr. Garrison, I can't reattach your organs. Because I've already used your testicles to fashion new knees for a little boy who wanted to be tall and black. And your scrotum has been made into a dorsal fin for a man who wanted to look more like a dolphin. He's going to play basketball? Oh my God. Well, ah I only made him ''look'' like he could play basketball. If he actually does it, the testicle in his knees will explode!  No, I just made him ''look'' more like one. We have to stop him from playing! Those testicles in his knees are ticking time balls! Come on, we've gotta get to those balls!  I'm sorry, Kyle, I should have told you the surgery was cosmetic only. Let's get you two up to the clinic and I'll change you back, for a nominal fee. Dude, don't be nervous. You're the best player at our school, dude. You'll make the team for sure. Good luck.  Dude, you were awesome, Kyle.  Kyle, you have to cheer up, dude. So you aren't built right for basketball. Wha-a-a negroplasty?? Uh excuse me, is this really a good idea? What? Jesus Christ, dude! Dude, is Kyle's- dad a- dolphin?  Kyle went down to play in the basketball game, Mrs. Garrison. What?! But you made him into a basketball player. Oh Jesus, he's about to play!  Kyle, NO!  Yeah, that's basically it. All right.  Hello, we are selling magazine subscriptions for our community youth program. Would you like to help young people like us by purchasing a subscription of your choice? Who are the corporations? Are you serious? We never heard that. Well... Well what do we do? ''Sign, sign everywhere. Sign''Done something to my mind. Mom, the mall is a way for the corporate fat cats to imprison you into a life of servitude. I've got some stuff you should read. Right, so how do we get back at them?  NO! Yeah! So it seems like we have enough people now. When do we start taking down the corporations? You mean like a baker and a cop?  Alright, I can't take it anymore! I'm getting on that stage! Uh, excuse me. Excuse me, can I have your attention please? What are we doing?  It's been nine days! Doesn't it seem like we should accomplish something? Maybe instead of complaining about corporations being selfish, we should look at ourselves. I mean, is there anything more selfish than doing nothing but getting high and listening to music all day long? Dude, these people have no idea what's going on. Let's get out of here. What? You mean, we're stuck here listening to this crap?  Dad! Token sings? Wow, two hundred dollars. Can you imagine? Yeah. We're too smart to be talented. Hey yeah! We deserve that money just as much as he does. He's looking at the sign. All right. It's genius.  Ohhhh Token. Right, yeah, you're makin' a smart move, man. You guys, we're gonna lose our client.  Look, Token, here's the bottom line. You're gonna start having a lot of offers comin' at you from all directions. A media storm is about to hit you and ''you'' can't handle it on your own. Nobody can. This thing in Denver is is just the crust, Token. With our support, you can have the whole pie. Ah Kenny, Token just signed with us! Oh, you're interested in hiring our client? You were awesome, Token! This is just the beginning. I bet we start to see all kinds of offers comin' in for Token now.  Uh excuse me, Token already has representation. So unfair... so unfair. Huh? You were looking for a talent agent? And what does she do? Uh, we're sorry dude, but getting her career off the ground would take too much work for us. Yeah! Hi, Mr. Lu Kim? Uh hi, it's Wing's agents. Everything's fine, yeah, but we're supposed to arrive in Los Angeles in about four hours. Listen, does your wife ever eat? Or anything? Uhh, all right. We'll call you after she goes on TV. Uh sure, here she is.  There it is! American Idol contestants! Ah our client has an audition to this show. Oh no, no no no, come on!  Excuse me, ma'am. No, I don't think you understand. We're here with Wing. That's right, ''the'' Wing.  We can't wait in line! We have to be in school on Monday! We have someone who's ready to go on TV right away! All right, our client will do it! What's "The Contender"? Go Wing!  Anyone? Help four boys and a Chinese woman get back to Colorado? Oh, thanks. You do?  We won't!  You guys, you guys! Sylvester Stallone wants Wing to sing at his son's wedding tomorrow! He's gonna pay her four thousand dollars! Yeah! Whoa whoa, wait, wait. ...where's Wing?  ...Oh Jesus Christ. If that big CAA talent agency finds out she has work, they're gonna try to steal her away from us again. Oh no!   Two four nine all right, this is the place. Hello? We want to talk to somebody right now! You tell 'em, Kyle! Jesus, they really want Wing as their client! No! Screw that, dude! If we keep letting CAA take all our clients, we're never gonna make it as talent agents! We've gotta split up and find Wing! You and Kenny go that way!  You bastards! Yeah, you wouldn't kill her, 'cause then she can't pay you money! We know because we're in the same business you are!  Guys! Guys! Guys! Don't you see what we're doing? Jesus... we're not talking about an object here, we're, we're talking about a person. I mean, look at what we've all become. All this violence and anger and, and for what? For control over somebody's life who... w-we're all just trying to leech off of. Wing doesn't belong to us ''or'' to you. We're all just caught up in a business that treats people like commodities. It's a lousy business. I quit. I think we all learned it's best to leave talent to the talented people.   Dude, you see what Kenny got? Yeah, Kenny finally found something he's really good at. Are we in trouble or something? Oh wow... Please what? What? Kenny? Dude, how'd you do that? Yeah, the lawyer lost that page. Now that Cartman got Kenny's feeding tube out, he's gonna die for sure!  Yeah! Let's go to the, uh, media. We'll make everyone in the country know that they're killing Kenny. Don't kill Kenny! Don't kill Kenny! Well, what does it say? Oooo. You mean, Cartman's side is right?  Aw Jesus, not again. Yes! It's over! It's over! We can start having fun again!  We did it! We did it! ... What? No... NOOO!! Look, you guys, maybe it's not all that bad. I know, but listen: the finals are all sudden-death elimination, right? That means as soon as we lose one game, our season is over. I know we can lose if we try. Okay, so then we'll just tell the other team quietly that we're gonna let them win, and then we'll act like we're trying. Our parents will never know. Hundred bucks, no big whoop. Uhh, hay guys, look, we don't wanna win, so uh,  here's a list of all the pitches I'm gonna throw, in order. Look! We're gonna be the losers tonight, all right?! Damnit! No!  Aw spit!  Oh no. No, no, no! Dad? Dad, we need to talk.  I don't suppose you guys want to win this game. Gay. Hey yeah. We need to find the very worst kid athlete in the whole world. Somebody who can't possibly win. Yeah, with him on our team, we don't stand a chance. Wow, he IS great at sucking. Dude, we had it all wrong. While we spent all our time trying to make our team suck, these guys practiced and got really good at sucking.    Come on, Dad! Get up! Dad!   Dude, where is she? We can't wait. Mom!  I want a breast! But Mom, we've been waiting for hours! All right. Okay, this is everything, mom.  Oh, boy!  Cartman, you ate the skin off of EVERY PIECE OF CHICKEN! I can't believe that fat asshole! Well this time he's gone too far! Why do we even hang out with him, anyway? Well it's not like we're nice to him. I mean, we rip on him all the time! All right. Then let's just ignore him. From now on, let's not talk to him, let's not even acknowledge him. I think I have extra. Here you go. Cartman isn't our friend anymore.  Who was that? Dude, he did that to me this morning. Yeah, we know better than to think that. Cartman? Hey Cartman, that was really cool what you did. Well, anyway, we just wanna let you know. Talk to you tomorrow. He's what??  A hundred dollar gift certificate to South Park Mall?  Maybe ''we'' should do the talent show. Dude, didja see, Jimmy? They're giving away a hundred-dollar first prize for the talent show.  Woof. Dude, you are right, Cartman. Your uncle Roy has a sweet boat. Man, I wish I could really drive this thing. Sure I do! Dude, I don't think your uncle'd want us driving it.  Okay, turn on the ignition, Okay...   Boats don't have parking brakes, dumbass! They only have the... oh wait wait. Neutral button!   Jesus Christ!!! Oh dude! Oh Jesus! You said you'd take responsibility to your uncle Roy! What? Oh God, I hope I didn't hurt any beavers. Huh oh.  Mom, Dad?  The, they're gonna go help those people, right? Ye-but, uh, s-somebody's gonna help the people off their, their rooftops, right? Dude! Dude, did you see the news last night? You saw all those people trapped on their roofs? Pretty funny?! Dude, we did that!! That was our fault! But they're trapped now and nobody's helping them! Maybe they couldn't get out! Dude, ah I just...  ah I don't know what to do here.  Nothing. Dad, isn't it possible the flood wasn't caused by global warming? I, I mean, the water was held back by a giant beaver dam, after all. Mom, you know, those people in Beaverton are still trapped in the flood. Kyle, it... it isn't global warming.  Global warming isn't happening right now. It's, it's not what caused the Beaverton flood. Because, I know what did cause the flood. No. No. No. No. ...sort of.  Shh! Not, not exactly. We were messing around in this guy's new boat, and Cartman egged me on, and, and I crashed it into the Beaverton dam. Look, maybe, maybe we can help those people in Beaverton ourselves. We can sneak out of here, get a boat, and go help them off their roofs. That way, I can do the right thing, but still lie about it. Uh, hey Dad. Dad, we're, we're trapped in Beaverton, We're, we were trying to save everyone! No, Dad, listen: I need to tell you something. Nothing. Can you just come get us, please? We have to find a way out!  Come on! We've gotta get to the roof!     No. I broke the dam. No. I broke the dam.  I broke the dam. I ran a boat into the dam and I broke it. No! I broke the fucking dam! I literally broke the dam! On a boat! That wasn't mine! I kept it secret, for two days! The boat caught on fire, and it exploded! Ohhh, fuck it! Yeah, us too. What? Oh my God, how does it know the answer? So what do you suggest? Yeah, there's just one problem: a boy can't go to a chicks' slumber party. But if one of us pretends to be the new girl in class, the girls will wonder where that boy went. All right, Butters, that's Heidi's house. Yeah dude, of course. Now go, the party's already started. Maybe they found him out. Come on, we gotta go check on him.  He's just dancing around. Come on, Butters. Ho-Hold on on guys. We're not sure what this device is capable of. Maybe we should wait until we've had more time to study it. Guys, guys, guys, stop!  Look at what this thing is doing to us. Butters was trying to tell me something outside the house. That this device is nothing but trouble. I think I know what he meant now. We risked everything to get it from the girls. How long before the girls attack us to get it back? And then what? Hide it forever from the government? From the... terrorists who want to use it for evil? Maybe... maybe nobody is meant to have this kind of power. We got it away from the girls. That's what matters. But now the right thing to do isn't using it ourselves, then we're no better than they are. Nobody will. That's the way it's suppose to be. Hit it, Kenny.   Oh no, dude, he's gonna put me with Wendy. So, I haven't even spoken to Wendy since we broke up. Kyle?? So, what are you and Wendy doing? Uh huh... Yeah, well, so is your hat.  I can't. I'm busy. ...So take it with you!  Well, maybe I didn't want to have an egg with you, okay, Bebe?!  HA!  Alright, give it to me. I'll take it home tonight.  Why do you say that? That's because I was pissed off! You think you're so great, don't you?! Well guess what?! Maybe ''I'' don't need ''your'' help! I'm taking the egg home tonight, and I'm gonna show everybody tomorrow that I'm every bit as good an egg-take-care-over as you!   Fine! No problems at all! It's right there, see?  Day five. I made it!  Hello? What? Governor's office? Aah, you'd like that, wouldn't you?! I took care of this egg, Kyle, not you! What's up?! Oh, nothing except that you've been trying to impress Wendy all week long like a pathetic dickhole! You've set it all up to look like you're this awesome prince and I'm just a loser! Well guess what?! I'm gonna take this egg to class myself! And I'm gonna hold it up in front of Wendy, and say "See?! I'm every bit as good as Kyle is."  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!  Dude, you should just go be with Wendy and be happy. Yeah well, I blew it. Now we're gonna fail and Wendy thinks I'm a total loser. I don't. She's totally lame.   I'm sorry I didn't trust you, Kyle. I'm obviously just a crappy best friend to have. Huh? That...  That's the real egg with Garrison's signature? Then... then Wendy ''won't'' think I'm a total loser! Come on, buddy, let's go!   There! Over there!  Excuse us! Excuse us please! Jesus Christ!   Dude, what's the big deal?  What about the Foley family? I think they're all ginger. I'm sorry, but I don't understand. You both have dark hair and brown eyes. You buying school lunch today? That's just wrong, dude. I wish Cartman could see what it felt like to be ginger. Sure, for what? Okay dude, knock him out.  All right, let's do it. You mean,you're a ginger? Maybe he'll actually learn a lesson this time.  Should we tell him the truth? Huh? Why? ... totally. You know, Cartman is an uncaring, bigoted intolerant asshole, but I have to admit, I had my own prejudice about gingers. I think we all need to realize that everyone is different in one way or another, and we shouldn't be threatened by those differences. I mean, Cartman had me kind of creeped out that gingers were gonna come get me in the night. You guys... need... anything?  More ginger kids. Um, meh-maybe we should just go home. The hell do they want?  Run, dude, run!! Kyle. Kyle, wake up. I think we're at the Sunset Room at the Airport Hilton. Cartman? I can't spend any money. I'm saving up for that bike I want.  Let's just do something fun that's free. Well I can't spend any money.  Excuse me? Uh what do I have to do? Fine. L-look, is this a religion? Because my family is like, Catholic or something. Then how come that sign says "Church of Scientology"? ''Seven'' and two. Uhhh, sh-sure? Yeah? Yes. So how did I do? ...Huh?? I am?? I didn't know that! What what do I do? I'm totally depressed. I don't know. I'm not sure. But... I need two hundred and forty dollars. No, I found a self-help program that can cure me. But I'm completely miserable and these people can help! Neither did I! Don't you care that I'm depressed?! What if I become suicidal, or, or become an alcoholic like Grandpa??  ...well but... but that's ''my'' money. I hope so. Really? Thetan levels... So, this is gonna make me happy? What? Stan. I took out the garbage yesterday. Aagh!  I don't know!   Jesus Christ... Aw dude, I need to go to bed. Yeah, I know who you are. Well-h. I mean, you're not... you're not like as good as Leonardo DiCaprio, but you're okay, I guess. I mean, you're not Gene Hackman or that guy who played Napoleon Dynamite, but you're okay. Hey!  Dude, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. Dude, this is ''my room''!  Dad! Tom Cruise won't come out of the closet! Tom Cruise locked himself in my closet and he won't come out.  I just told him I thought the Napoleon Dynamite guy is a better actor than he is. Sure. I, I guess. But I don't know any of this stuff. Okay, I'll try. I just wish I could write in my room, but Tom Cruise won't come out of the closet.  Yeah, yeah! I can't. I'm writing a new sacred doctrine for my church. Cult? Scientology isn't a cult, Kyle. I've read all this stuff and it's based on fact. I did not! Those are rumors put out by people who are afraid because they don't know the secret truth. I can't tell you unless you pay for a few years of audit counseling! All I know is that I was depressed before, and now I found meaning! Neither did I! But now, if you guys can't accept this great thing I belong to, then I suppose we're no longer friends!  I wrote that um, our followers shouldn't fly in DC-8s anymore because they're too much like Xenu's evil cruisers. And I wrote that the evil Lord Xenu was recently broken out of galactic jail. And best of all, I wrote that all the Scientologists should no longer have to pay money to belong. I I realize that to really be a church, we can't charge people for help. ... Well, it's not about the money, it's about the message, right? But you said that there were- But then, why me? Why do you need me to write something so badly? Three million dollars? Yeah. Yeah, I get you. Uh, thanks. So, first of all, I've written that the brainwashed alien ghosts are actually from a galaxy called Nubanon. And uh, oh,  ...I ...I can't do this. Look, everybody, we're all looking for answer, you know. We all want to understand who we are and where we come from, but... sometimes we want to know the answers so badly that we... believe just about anything.  I'm not the reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard. And... Scientology is just a big fat global scam. What?? YOU told me it was a lie! Well fine! Go ahead and sue me! Well go on, then! Sue me! Okay, good! Do it! I'm not scared of you! Sue me!  Okay, where to next? Let's go see the stingrays, and then we can go to the sea lion show. What? I don't believe it. Why don't you just tell the people here at the sea park? It's true. The whale talked to all of us. In between shows at his orca tank. All right. In order to make our plan work, we're going to need the pool from Clyde's back yard, Timmy's wheelchair, the Russian government, and all of our skateboards. Craig, Token, get the slings ready.  What happened? They were going to do it for that 'N Sync guy. Uh, excuse me, we're looking for the Mexican...  Aeronautica y Spacia Administra-tio-n? Thanks.  Is this the Mexican space program?  Does the Mexican space programs have rockets that can go to the moon? This rocket will fly to the moon? To the moon?  We want to take something to the moon. How much would that cost? Two hundred? Million?  Quick, call Kyle. They're on their way, Manuel. Is the rocket gonna be ready?  Back down the ramp! It's all rigged to go! Kyle, it's all set to go!  Okay, Manuel, hit it.  Thanks for the ride, Manuel. I wonder... if he'll ever come back and visit us.  Wait. Where's my Dad? Yeah. Dad? Where the hell could he have gone?? Dad, weren't you watching? Dad, aren't you supposed to like, not drink and drive? Why not just pull over? Dad, we're gonna crash! Aww, it's all warm!  This is sooo embarrassing. Look, guys, about last night, can you just be quiet about it? Because, I don't want everyone knowing, okay? Could we please just keep this to ourselves? Oh Jesus.  Dad! What the hell are you doing?! Dad, it's the middle of the day! I thought you weren't going to drink as much anymore! What?? Did you go to your AA meeting?! Dad, you've had enough! Just stop now! Aww, Goddammit! Dad, what are you doing in Grandpa's extra wheelchair?! No! You don't need another beer! Dad, you just need to not drink so much. It's very simple. Ah, excuse me, who's in charge here? Uh, look, my dad was here yesterday and ...you all kind of messed him up by telling him he had a disease? No it, it's not. And, y-you can't just go around saying stuff like that to people like my dad. He He's kind of, a hypochondriac No, cancer is a disease. My dad needs to drink less. No, he just needs a disciprine. But thanks to you people, my dad now thinks he has a disease that he can't cure himself. Yeah, and I also know a thing or two about cults. I was the leader of one for a while.   Dad?! Dad, what are you doing?! Dad, you're drunk! You're not driving a car!  What?? Dad, you can't drive! Your license is suspended, remember?! If you get pulled over again, you're gonna go to jail for ten years! ... I'm eight! Where? I can't see.  Oh my God... Dad, let's just wait our turn. I just, my dad was- What?! No, Dad, people will see!  Dad, we're going back! Praise Christ. Naw, Dad, all the guys are going to Kyle's hosue to watch the Bronco game. Kenny and Kyle's Dads were hoping you'd come. No, my dad doesn't drink. Dad, Dad, Stop! Dad, you don't have to do this! You have the power. You haven't drank since seeing the statue. Yeah. The statue wasn't a miracle, Dad. So that means ''you'' did it. That means ''you'' didn't have a drink for five days all on your own. No! Dad, you like to drink. So have a drink once in a while. Have two. If you devote your whole life to completely avoiding something you like, then that thing still controls your life and, 'n you've never learned any discipline at all. Naw. All or nothing is easy. But learning to drink a little bit, responsibly, that'sa disciprine. Disciprine... come from within.  I've had a great teacher. No not you, my karate teacher. He's really smart. All right! That's probably okay if you spread it out. I think you're pushing it. That's not disciprine. Dad! How can I not be nervous? Trying out for the All-State team has been my dream for years.  Yeah? Yep! I love basketball. I wanna play for the Denver Nuggets one day. Oo whataya mean? I know. I deserve it. You're right.  But I feel like a basketball player. That's all I wanna do.  Mom? Dad? What's a sex-change operation? But our teacher, Mr. Garrison? He just had his penis made into a vagina. How come? Yeah. That's right. Totally! I totally understand! Yeah. My school teacher wanted to be a woman, and you made him into one. Well, do you also do other surgeries like that? No, no, uh I wanna be tall and black. I hate being small and Jewish. I feel like a tall black man. Yeah!  Mom! Dad! I have awesome news! The doctor who gave Mr. Garrison his sex change said he can make me tall and black.  Dr. Biber said he can give me a negroplasty so I can finally look the way I've always wanted. He even took my picture and then did computer imaging to show what I would look like after the surgery.   Can I have three thousand dollars, Mom and Dad, huh?? Can I??  But why not? You said sometimes people need surgery to make them feel better about themselves. Well, all ''my'' life I felt I was black! I've listened to hip-hop, I watch UPN and I love playing basketball! My body doesn't reflect who I am inside. Why? Why do I have to accept it when I can change it? But Jews can't play basketball!   Yeah, but it was totally worth it.  Look, Stan, I'm finally whole! My dad is even gonna take me back down to the all-star game to see if I can try out for the team again!  Alright, Dad!   Coach! Coach, I'm all better. I'm ready to play. Ih it's me, Kyle Broflovski. I had a negroplasty. Can I play in the All-State team now? All right!  I'm a hundred percent ready, coach!  All right!  I got it! I got the ball.  But what about Mr. Garrison? He can't go back. Hey, let's ask them.  Wha- whataya mean? Ugh! Those dirty liars! Yeah, we're pissed off. Cartman, what the hell are you doing?! You said it! Yeah, so, where are they. Let's go get 'em. Yeah, it's called a town. You're doing what? We can't. Kenny just checked. There's a wall of people like seven miles thick behind us. Whoa, Cartman. We aren't gonna be hippies anymore. Y-you don't have to kill us. How come we never get opportunities like that? We're not talented? Probably. Why? Can I talk to you?!  What the hell are you doing?! Abraham Lincoln has been dead for two hundred years! Yes he does! Tolkien actually pays attention in school! Unlike you, fatass! Eminem, Justin Timberlake, Hootie... They all have agents. You ''need'' somebody to manage it all for you. Welcome to the team, Tolkien. We knew you could do it! Twenty dollars. Mister, you can't do this to us! All that time and effort we spent helping Tolkien and this is the thanks we get?! Sir, we would ''love'' to sign your wife. Jesus, we made it just in time!  Oh crap! Ma'am, we are a very important talent agency. If your producers knew you were forcing people of our stature to the back of the line, well- Aw, just forget it!  Goddamnit! Goddamnit! Ahh-d, excuse me, sir, did I hear you say you needed somebody for your show? Hey, is your show as good as America Idol? Let's do it Wing! Oh my God, dude! What? Get out! Woohoo! Yeah! What do you mean? We thought she was with you. Wing? Wing? They did it to us again! That dirty talent agency stole our client again! Damn, CAA is pretty impressive. You assholes stole our client! How about some Goddamn business ethics?! You think you own the entertainment business, but you don't! Give us back Wing, RIGHT NOW!  Dude, maybe we should give up! Cartman!  Wing?  Stupid talent agents!  We're gonna get Wing back as our client and... and make a ton of money! I swear it to you! They killed Kenny! She had a contract with us first! ''We'' own her! Her life belongs to us! Yeah. Yeah. It's not a very satisfying feeling. Me too.  Tolkien? That thing is pretty cool. What games did you get with it? Wuh what'd I do? Wow, level nine already? Dude, you kick ass in "Heaven versus Hell." Kenny had a will? That's... really touching. Oh my God!  Kenny! You're alive! He did not say that! You just want him dead so you can have his stupid PSP! He did not! Did not! Cartman! Cartman is NOT Kenny's BFF!  That dirty no-good sonofabitch! How can they let an eight-year-old decide Kenny's fate? Dude, we have to do whatever we can to get that feeding tube put back in! Yeah, come on!  We want all the country to see that Kenny is alive, and in pain! You say tomato, but I say Kenny! Oh geez. Maybe we let this thing get out of hand. This issue is so complicated, but... m-maybe we sh-should just let Kenny go in peace. Cartman's side is right, for the wrong reasons. But we're wrong, for the right reasons. Come on, everybody. I think Kenny wants to be left alone.   This is it, Stan. If you strike this kid out, we all get to go home. Aw God, I'm so ''borrred''.  Come on, Stan! Just strike this kid out so we can end the season!  No more boring baseball until next year! Nobody said anything about a post-season. I can't believe it. I can't believe we have to keep on playing. You mean, throw the game? You know how our parents are about this sport. You hate this game too? No, ''we're'' gonna get creamed! Dude, he's not gonna swing! So just throw balls. That way he'll have to walk to first base.  Crud!  What? Dude, what are we gonna do? We can't win this game. I know who. There he is! Now, don't let him know we think he's a loser, or else he won't play.  Dude, thanks for helping us out by joining our team. You guys are so good you'll probably go all the way to win the national title! Aw crap!  Oh my God... their pitcher was able to hit him right on the bat. Jesus Christ! They can bat themselves out!  Our whole summer, dude. We have to play this boring game all summer long. Get up! You have to fight!  God, this is gonna be sooo yummy. She's here! I want some!  All right, let's eat Colonel!  The skin's the best part... You can't believe it?? He does this shit all the time! Hello?? I've been saying this for years! Yes, but he ''thrives'' on that. That sounds great! Do any of you guys have milk money I can borrow? Thanks.  We're ignoring him. Because he's a fat racist self-centered intolerant manipulating sociopath! There ''were'' no good times! And if he really feels bad he can just tell me himself! It was Cartman having Butters apologize for him. He probably thinks if he apologizes to everyone, we'll think he's changed and let him back into our circle. We didn't think that by pretending you didn't exist, you would really change, but you really have. Well, what's the point? Jimmy always wins with his stand-up comedy. I don't know how you do it, dude. How do you get up in front of that many people? Huh wuh, what's the matter?  Sorry I couldn't make it yesterday. What'd you guys do?  Can you believe it, Stan? I never thought global warming could happen so fast. I guess... I didn't listen. Huh? How do you know that? George Bush? Terrorists? Communists? Chinese radicals? ...Cartman?  Cartman flooded Beaverton?!!  Dude, you have to tell everyone. Right now. Stan, people in Beaverton are still trapped on their roofs. Nobody's helping them because they think they can't go outside. How? We can't get out! The flames are too big!  Dude, this whole building is going to collapse! Oh Jesus, we have to hurry! What are you doing? What gold?? No, Cartman, I have no idea what you're talking about! Jews do NOT carry gold in a little bag around their necks.Cartman! Stop playing around! Dude, we don't have time for your stupid jokes! We're gonna die! Goddamnit, you ''know'' I don't carry gold in a little bag around my neck, Cartman! Whattaya want from me?! ...Okay, fine! Here!  Now let's go! What are all you guys doing here? The girls do not have a device that shows them the future Cartman. That's retarded. The outside of the device seems to be covered in numerals. Inside are colors... which must open up to some sort of temporal time warp. That's a pretty solid idea. But who? Now ''look'', Butters, when the girls bring out the future-telling device, pay attention to how it works. Once you know how to operate it, just grab it and get the hell out of there. Jesus, what are they doing in there? Can you see anything?  Wait! I don't wanna know that! I don't wanna know when I'm going to die, fatass!  It's too much power. For anybody. Stan's right. It has to be destroyed. Hello? Oh, hey, dude. Oh, we're just makin' a cradle out of an egg carton for our egg. We figure that way it'll be easier to keep safe so we can get an A. I don't think it's gonna be that hard to keep it from breaking. This whole assignment is stupid. Why? Who? Okay, there. Now we can carry this egg around in this case without it getting cracked. Look, Stan, you want me to just take care of this egg? It's just that... I really need this A, Stan. And Bebe did say you almost broke your last egg. At who?  Huh? Wendy, it isn't your egg anymore! Well, you might have made it, but we're the ones who are taking care of it now. You have your own egg to look out for!  Wendy, I just wanna get an A, okay? Let's not make this any more confusing than it already is. <>[Stan peeks out from the kitchen and sees Kyle's arm around Wendy] Wendy, nothing's gonna happen to the egg. You can have it when the week is over and I have my grade.  Freakin' weirdos, man. What the hell is wrong with everybody? Dude, it's totally fine. Dude, did you hear what's happening? Garrison is taking us all on a field trip today. He wants to do the final egg check in front of the Governor's office! She's really taking this grade seriously, Stan. I'm gonna come over so that we can take our egg to school together, all right? Okay, Stan, you've been an asshole to me all week! What is up?! Impress Wendy?? What the hell are you talking about?! Stan? Stan? Stan, I think we should talk. Stan, I don't like Wendy.  All I cared about was getting an A in this stupid project! I thought you didn't care about Wendy anymore. Stan, there was never anything between Wendy and I.  I wouldn't go out with my best friend's ex-girlfriend. Yyeah well, I-I'm sorry I didn't trust you either.  and kept the original safe with me. Yeah dude. I'm sorry. Yeah. And I can still get my A! Stan...  Do you really think my hat is stupid?  Mr. Garrison, it's Kyle! Our egg is okay! We'll be there in a couple of minutes! Don't fail us! We'll be right there!  Keep running!  Hang on! Wait!   Gays can get married? What??  What did we do?  What?! That's not true, fatass! I have red hair, and I don't have to avoid the sun! This is all a bunch of crap! It's not a presentation, it's a hate speech! People aren't creeped out by gingers! Fine, I will!  Stupid supremacist asswipe! What's the big deal? Don't you understand what ignorant prejudice like that can lead to? I have to disprove Cartman's hateful rumors! Do you know any red-haired, freckled kids? Hey. Wuh I'm giving a speech tomorrow about people with red hair and freckles. Can I ask you a few questions? We... came to learn the facts about people with red hair, light skin and freckles. But it's... it's not true they... have no souls.  I just had a couple more questions about- And so, red hair, light skin, and freckles are all passed down genetically. A child's red hair is not determined by the lack of a ''soul'',  Thanks, Butters. Nah, my mom packed me a kosher lunch. There! You see?! This is what happens when Cartman is allowed his right to free speech!  That's a great idea! Can you guys meet me over at Cartman's house tonight at around midnight? We're gonna teach that fat bastard a lesson! Wow, Cartman. You look... different. Is that an umbrella you're using?  ...Wow, that's a little ironic, isn't it? Well, I mean, all last week you were ripping on ginger kids and now you ''are'' one. Dude, this is going awesome. Dude, check it out.  We did it guys. We finally taught Cartman a lesson. I'll bet that now, Cartman is gonna have a long hard think about how he treated gingers. I don't believe it. Nah, let him make a complete ass out of himself for a little while longer.  Dude, we're gonna go sneak into Cartman's and change him back into a non-ginger! Because now he's acting like gingers are awesome. And all his friends are gingers. When he wakes up tomorrow and realizes he ''isn't'' really ginger, it'll be hysterical! Are you in? Oh... hey there.  Let's just... let's just walk this way.  Yeah, good idea.  Kenny! In there! Let's go!   Oh Jesus, I should have known! Cartman! I need to tell you something! Aah I think you'd rather hear this in private! You are such a manipulative asshole, Cartman. Oh dude, check it out. I got a Jake Plummer. How come you didn't buy any cards, Stan? So what should we do now? It's Saturday and we have to have as much fun as possible. Yeah dude, nothing fun is free. Yeah. See ya.  Hey Stan, we're gonna go to the movies. Look, Stan, we're really getting concerned about this cult that you're getting into. Dude, L. Ron Hubbard was a science-fiction writer. He lived on a boat with only young boys and got busted by the feds numerous times. What secret truth?? I didn't know you were depressed. Dude, Jambu is the best!  Let's just stay here and watch the whale swim around some more. Dude, everyone's leaving! We can walk right up to the tank and really study him. I'll meet up with you guys in a little bit. I-I wanna hang out here some more. Jambu? Jambu?  Cool! It worked! Hey, Jambu.  Who said that? No way!  South Park. What do you wanna talk about? Rocket ships? Why? Aren't you happy here? This is amazing! But wait right here. I've gotta go tell my friends about this!   Hey you guys! You guys are not gonna believe this! Dude, he talks! The orca whale talks! I went up to Jambu's tank and I tapped three times like the trainer did. Jambu swam up and started talking to me about rocket ships! Come on! You gotta check it out!  Jambu! Jambu, I'm back!  Ja- Jambu? Are you still feelin' lonely here? He talked! I swear to Abraham he talked, and he loves rocket ships! Goddammit, say something! Jambu! Jambu, why didn't you speak up before? Sick? Oh my God... That's terrible! Alright guys, listen up! This may sound a little strange, but, the whale, at the Denver Sea Park, is going to die, unless we get it to the moon, The whale's name is Willzy-x, and he told us he's dying on our planet. We've come up wth a plan, but we're gonna need all of your help to make it work. Weh-well, why didn't you tell anybody? Well you're NOT crazy. The whale talked to all of us. And he needs our help getting him home. Nobody else is going to help him, you guys. We've got a chance to do something pretty special here. Are you with us? Stan?  Shhh. Willzy-x, don't say anything. We're gonna bust you out of here. Hi. My name's Kyle. Uh, I understand that your country flies people into space for money. I need to book one trip to the moon, please. Right away. You can? Awesome!  Are you nuts? We don't have that kind of money. But you need to understand: we have a whale here that needs to get back to his family on the moon. They want twenty million dollars. All right, look, there's gotta be other Third-World countries with space programs. We've gotta split up and find someplace cheaper, that's all. I can't, Mom. We're working on our school project. Okay ma, thanks!  Yes, yes, hello? Is this Mr. Su-gi-yama with the Japanese space program?  Hello? Jimmy, any luck at the Chinese Embassy? Ten million?? Well that's more than the Germans want! Damnit!  Tell me what to do, Willzy-x! How do we get you home?? Yeah... He must be really sick.  Hang on Willzy-x. There's still hope. Stan and Craig might still luck with the space program down in Mexico. Hang on, Willzy-x. Hang on, buddy. Hang on, Willzy-x. We'll in Mexico soon!. Huh? You don't understand! Willzy-x is from the moon! He'll die if we don't get him back, now! Willzy-x, you ''have'' to talk! Come on boy, you have to! I know you're sick, but you could do it! No! Please, we have to go! But... we were so close... I'm sorry, Willzy-x. We tried. All right!! It belongs with its family! Tijuana, Mexico! You're going home, Willzy-x!  Willzy-x, I think we're here. Come on, guys!  Hang on.  Get him in the water!  We did it! All right. Thanks for your help, dudes.  Well, we did it, guys. It wasn't easy, but... we did a really amazing thing. I don't know, but at least from now on, every time we look at the moon, we can know that Willzy-x is up there, dancing with the other zypods in his castle.  He knew he had to take us all home, too, right? Are you sure you're all right? Dude, I think you're being followed.  I think his pants are falling down. You know, I didn't even get home until 2:30. This is ridiculous. Jews can't play basketball. Nyanyanyanyanyaaanyaaa! You-hoo-hoo-hoo loh-ost! Hahahahahaaahaaa!  Kyle, I'm totally ripping on you at a totally inappropriate time. Yeah, you know why? Because Jews can't play basketball! Jesus, that's no fun. You guys, Mr. Garrison has titties. He's a ''Jewish'' dolphin. A Jewphin. Hello, ma'am. I'm working to clean up the neighborhood from parasites. Do you mind if I take a quick look around your house? I'm afraid you may have hippies.  Hm, I don't like the sound of that. Could I take a look in your attic? Oh yeah, boy. Take a look at this, ma'am.  These are what we call the uh giggling stoners. Pretty common form of hippie, usually found in the attics. Problem is, if you see one hippie, there's probably a whole lot more you're not seein'. Uh, whe-where's the backyard. Yep, that's what I thought. See that? You've got a drum circle in your backyard.  Yeah. You know, I had a guy in Jackson County. He had a little drum circle in his backyard. It turned into a drum circle four miles in diameter. You get a few hippies playing drums and next thing you know, you got yourself a colony.  God damn hippie!  Get out of here! Ma'am, I need to clear out your giggling stoners and your drum-circle hippies RIGHT NOW, or soon they're gonna attract something much worse! The college know-it-all hippies.  All right, in you go. Get back. Get back or you're all gonna get maced!  What's wrong is that there's more of you showing up every day and I need to find out why! Brah, I'm not gonna argue with you, all right? Just go with it. And you're gonna be here a little longer, brah, all right? Here, here's some joints  Please, I have to talk to you all right now! Mayor, something very big is happening, and if you all don't give me a moment of your time, there may be no more South Park to council over! I'm talking about the end of all life as we know it.  Three new drum circles have sprouted up here, here, and here. They're all growing in diameter, at a rate of two hippies per hour. What this means... is that the hippies are conglomerating. They're ''thriving'', if you will. I think that they're setting up for a... hippie music festival. It's, it's simple science. Look: When hippies start to nest in a new area, it draws other hippies in. With the right weather conditions and topography, it can lead to a music festival. One that lasts for days, even weeks. Reggae on the River, Woodstock, Burning Man, they will all pale in comparison to what we're looking at now. In my professional opinion... I think we're looking at a full-blown hippie jam festival the size of which we've never seen.  I know hippies. I've hated them all my life. I've kept this town free of hippies on my own since I was five and a half. But I can't contain them on my own anymore. We have to do something, fast! It's not pot''holes'' you need to worry about. It's pot''heads''. I know what these people are capable of. What are you doing?!  I ''knew'' you were trying to have a hippie jam festival! All right, everyone pack up your crap, we're going to my basement!  What happened? Were you bit? Did you eat their brownies? DID YOU EAT THEIR BROWNIES?! Listen, you're my friends, but if you've been compromised, I'll have no problem taking you out! I'd expect the same from you.  Everybody get in a single-file line! Ah, Officer Barbrady, you're just in time. These college know-it-all hippies were setting up for a music festival, just as I predicted. What? You let them out?! Jesus, we have to find them! No! No, we have to stop them! You know how we-?! We gotta stop them! Hebbiaaay!  What did I do?! They're not people, they're HIPPIES!  Mayor! Mayor, I confirmed the data! The hippies are going to have a massive jam band concert!  You... You what? They're hippies! They don't HAVE any money! Does the city council know about this?! You just SOLD OUT OUR TOWN!    How much money is enough, Mayor?! How many people's lives it is all worth?! God damned hippies!  Great, I love crapping in a toilet with no rim on it.  Let me guess: they've started a hippie jam band music festival.  It's too late! Even if I did agree to help, there's too many of them now!  Don't think that you can buy me with presents! ...Unless of course it's the new Tonka radio-controlled play bulldozer. I want the batteries for it too. And I get to drive it around in the school parking lot. Yes.  Kyle doesn't get to have one! Ever! And he has to watch ''me'' drive ''mine'' around the school parking lot and get super-jealous! All right, fine. But now listen up and listen good! I've never tried to get rid of this many hippies before, so I'm gonna need every resource this town has! And even if I don't succeed, and it's a million-to-one shot that I will, I still get the Tonka radio-controlled bulldozer and get to play with it in the school parking lot where Kyle has to watch me and be super-jealous because he doesn't have one! Are we clear?!  All right, everyone listen up! The hippie jam band festival is now fourteen miles in diameter and five hundred thousand hippies thick. In less than three days, all of South Park will be completely consumed. Our only hope is to fight our way to the center of the crowd, and reach the heart, here.  Hippies can't stand death metal. If everything works, they should disperse just before they consume us all. We drill.  I've designed a vehicle that can bore its way through even the densest hippie crowd. The pilots inside will be safe from the pot smoke and the crappy music outside. Not just somebody. I need a complete team to operate this vehicle. Along with me I'm gonna need a scientist, an engineer, and of course, a black person who can sacrifice himself in case something goes wrong. All right, then we just need a black person who can sacrifice himself in case something goes wrong.  There's no more time for ideas! We have to have this vehicle up and operational in less than three days! Look, it's a long shot! But it's also the only shot we-  got. I... don't want you to worry about me, Clyde Frog.  Primary engine running? Navigation systems? Let's punch this baby.  Reaching hippie crowd. Hull status? Switching to secondary fuel line.  What's that? Come on, come on! No, Chef, I'm not gonna let you go out there! ...All right, fine Chef, go! Hit the PA system NOW!  You're the scientist, jackass! Put them in my laptop!  Hold it right there, Kyle!  ''Kill'' you? Oh no. I have much bigger plans for you, Kyle. Hoho! Aw man, this is awesome! Weeeee!  Oh, sorry! You don't get to! Hehe. Oh, check it out! Cooool! Of course he sings. He's black. Two hundred dollars. You wanna know what it is, guys? That's right. We're not talented. See, we're not the artistic side, we're the thinking side.  Wait, you guys! I just had an amazing idea. Tolkien is going right to the top, right. I mean, he's gonna be a huge star. So, why shouldn't ''we'' get some of that money? We can be Tolkien's agents. That way, we get ten percent of whatever he makes! We just need a really kickass office and some nice suits. A and a fountain in our lobby. All top agencies have fountains in their lobbies. We gotta make Tolkien think he needs us, when actually he doesn't need us at all.  Perfect! All right, you guys get back to the office, I'll bring Tolkien there. Wait a minute! You guys, this is very important: when I bring Tolkien back to the office, have Kenny hide in another room, and call the phone on my desk. Because I'll answer and pretend I'm talking to somebody super famous and important. When Tolkien sees that, maybe he'll think we're legit.  Oh hey, Tolkien! Buddy, my man, what is up?!  Hey, you know, I heard you were doing something down in Denver tomorrow night. Yeah I don't know if I ever told you this before, but I'm actually an agent over at the Super Awesome Talent Agency. You may have seen our ads around town. Anyway, why don't you come down to the office, Tolkien? Maybe I can convince the company to represent you. This will only take a second. Welcome to our offices, Tolkien. As you can see, we are quite a successful company. Did you notice the fountain? Pretty nice, hm?  Guys, you remember Tolkien. He's thinking about becoming a client. Now, Tolkien, I I know what you're saying to yourself: You're saying, "Hey, why do I need an agency? Why should I give them ten percent?" Right?  Yeah, yeah, no, I'm happy you called, Abraham Lincoln. I'm just sort of in the middle of something right now. I'll I'll call you back, Abe.  I'm making it look like important people call us.  ...well Tolkien doesn't know that. How?! Jew!  Yes, yes, I think that's a good idea, guys. Let's give Michael Jordan a call about that.  Ah, now, where were we? Uh if... we could just get you to sign right here?  From now on, we are an entertainment team, Tolkien. You just do all the singing, all the performing and all the entertaining,and leave the rest to us. We represent Tolkien.  Give us a call, we'll work out a deal. Two hundred dollars, Tolkien, that's great! And ten percent of two hundred is... Sweet! You may have heard of Super Awesome Talent Agency. Tolkien, you signed with us! What?! Uh they're not so great! They probably don't have a fountain in their lobby! ...Oooo... ...Goddamnit!  This just goes to show that hard work doesn't pay off! I'm gonna be a homeless drug addict from now on!  You've ...already done all the work? We'll go to LA with your wife. All she has to do is go on the show, do all the performing, make all the money, and leave the rest to us.  Excuse us! Dude, how long is the wait? Brrr brrr! Brrr brrr! Oh, excuse me, everyone. That's my cell phone.  Hello? Oh yes, hi, Colonel Sanders! Yes, I'm doing great, but you know, heh, someone at American Idol doesn't know who Wing is. Eh eh, you're right, Colonel Sanders! You shouldn't give her any more chicken. Stupid assholes!  Is there a cash prize involved in your show as well? Come on, Wing! She's got a hell of a chin on her, I'll give her that.  Gay. Your gift of hope is a great deduction.  Thanks, Mr. Stallone. We're just sorry she wasn't a better boxer.  Four thousand dollars?  That's four hundred for us! We did it!  ''Who let the dogs out?'' ''Who let the dogs out?'' ''Who let-?'' Naw, sh-she was with you!  Wing? Wing? Wing? Here, Wing! Not this time! They dropped their card. Now we know where CAA Talent Agency is! We're gonna march in there, and get our client back. Of course it's impressive! They steal everyone else's clients! Yeah, whatever. You can suck our balls. Oh my God, you guys. Look!  Yeah, if these talent agents wanna play rough, we can play rough too!  Do you wanna play rough?! Okay!  Don't give us that crap! She's no good to you dead and you know it! Aw aw guys, come on! Tolkien, you're... waiting tables? Aw man, that's too bad, Tolkien. Hey, could you bring us some more bread, huh? Oh and some more olive oil. Chop chop!  Mom! Mom! Get up, we have to go!  MOM, GET UP!  Everyone's moms are taking their kids after school! We're outsmarting everyone by getting to the store right when it opens! Let's go! I can't wait to see the look on everyone's faces when I show up to school with a PSP! I wonder if Kyle will cry? Oh PLEASE let Kyle cry!  WHAT THE HELL?! Kenny, when did you get here? Friday?! Aw, Jesus!  Uh, my friend Kenny was saving my place in line. Oh, Goddammit!  They'd better not sell out! YES YES, I KNOW! UP YOURS, KYLE!  JUST SHUT YOUR JEW MOUTH!!! ''(looking bored)'' Fags!  Oh yeah! Oh yeah, baby! Who the man? Who the ''man''? Who cares? Kenny's dead!  When do I take possession of my PSP, sir?  Yes! Well... well then he's NOT alive. That's not Kenny. Kenny sniffs paint and sets things on fire! Here, look.  Kenny, Kenny look. Want a dollar? Oh, I just remembered! Kenny told me this one time, that he wouldn't wanna be kept alive via feeding tube. Um, it was um, this one time... Stupid? PSP is stupid?!  Uh I mean, I mean this isn't about PSP, Kyle! This is about my friend, and his wishes. And Kenny said he didn't want to live like this! Did so! Fine! We'll see about this, you freakin' Jew!  You see your honor, I was the only one that Kenny McCormick told his wishes to. And Kenny told me specifically that he would never want to be kept alive on a machine. What they're doing to him ...is not right. I do have legal authority, your honor. You see, I was Kenny's... BFF. That's right. Kenny and I have been BFFs since first grade. Here, look.  Kenny has the other half of this BFF necklace. I believe you all know what that means, and how serious this is.  He's right in here. That's right. Respect our authoritah. I believe the people at home see he's NOT in pain because he's a tomato! You say Kenny, but I say tomato!  What?  We're done! No more baseball! All right, we did it!  Post-season? Nobody told us if we win too many games we'd go on to the finals! All right, hit one out of the park!  Come on, kid, you gotta at least swing at it. All right!  Ball. Balll.  That was no strike, that was a terrible pitch! You need some Goddamned lasik surgery! What?!  How the hell was that a strike?!  Goddamnit, he's going to first! What happens if we win the State Championship game? Wiat. I've got it, you guys. A fifth point in a sports movie, the team always goes out and finds a really sweet player to join their team. Exactly right, Clyde. So what ''we'' need... is to find somebody to join ''our'' team, who totally sucks ass. I don't think so! You guys are way too good! You're the best at this game!  We're gonna lose! We're gonna lose! Stan, you said your mom was bringing Kentucky Fried Chicken home for dinner! Now is she or isn't she?!  She's got Colonel! Oh boy! Some extra-crispy thighs, extra crispy? Come on guys. If we all help out, we can do it super-fast.    Oh wow, a Jew asking for money! There's a new one.  Yuh, you guys know why Jews have glassy eyes? Dude, Stan, yuh you know why Jews have glassy eyes? Like Kyle?  I can't be dead!! No! No!! Oh my God, this can't be happening!   Dead and... still wandering the earth a lost soul.  How can my own God forsake me?! Am I doomed to wander the Earth alone for all eternity?! ...What did you say? Butters...  Butters! You can see me?? Oh my God, and you can hear me?? Because, Butters, I'm... dead.  Butters! Butters, I just want to talk to you! I ate a bunch of chicken skin and it blew out my insides. I don't know, but you're the only one who can. Butters!  Butters, Goddamnit, I need your help! Butters... Butters, you have to help me! All right, Butters, you leave me no choice.   Butters. Butters, Goddamnit, I'm not in your imagination! I'm dead and for some reason you can see me! Get a hold of yourself! I'm the one who died! And for some reason, my spirit is trapped here on Earth. I can't find the passage to Heaven. What do you mean? I'm not going to Heck, Butters! I'm not black, all right?! Now look: I thnk the reason my soul is still here is because I need closure with all my friends and loved one. I can say my final goodbyes to them through you. This is your problem, Butters! Either you help me, or I will haunt you for the rest of your life!   Tell her, tell her that I love her.  Tell her, tell her that I wish... I wish I would have been a better son sometimes!  It's just that, it's just that I got so caught up with the rat race of life tryin' to succeed that I... sometimes... took my family for granted! Just the good times. I can't! Don't you understand?! God forgave the Jews, you should be able to forgive me!  Okay, that takes care of Tolkien, Clyde, and Mr. Kitty. That's everyone, I guess.  All that leaves is you, Butters. Butters, I'm sorry if I ever did anything to hurt you.  Well, it's all done. My soul is at peace. I think... I can go now. Don't be sad, Butters. What awaits each person in heaven is eternal bliss, divine rest, and ten thousand dollars cash.  Goddamnit, what the fuck is going on? What else do I have to do?! Atone?  Not really... Let's see. Oh, and I broke Mr. Anderson's fence and never told him about it. I took a crap in the principal's purse... seven times. Then there was the time I convinced a woman to have an abortion so I could build my own Shakey's Pizza. I pretended to be retarded and joined the Special Olympics. I tried to have all the Jews exterminated last spring. Uhh, oh yeah, and there's this one kid whose parents I had killed and then made into chili which I fed to the kid. Really? I know how. Well, there's everything, Butters.  I've made everything right. Yes, Butters, my soul is finally at peace. It's time for me to leave.  Goddamnit, what?! I've made everything right! I want my eternal bliss! Do you think this is funny, God?!  Do you think this is funny?  Butters. Don't worry, Butters, I'm gonna get you out of here. I found the woman you need to talk to for me. Look!  Doctor Lindsay, expert in the paranormal. She can tell us what to do! She's gonna close soon! Come on!  Of course. That's it, Butters! We had it wrong all the time! I told you, Butters.  Oh my God, this is it, Butters. This is what I'm here to stop. Come on, Butters. This psychic boy and his ghost pal are going to save the day! All right, Butters, I'm going in alone, first. Give me thirty seconds in there, and then you go in and free the hostages. Don't worry. I have a plan.  They can't hurt me, Butters. I'm already dead.  Yes, it's working!  Well, we did it, Butters. We saved the day. My spirit is at rest now. I can finally go to everlasting peace, eternal rest, and ten thousand dollars cash. Butters, I think that, through this whole thing, we've really become friends. We both, kind of needed each other and... well... I'm gonna miss you.   You sonofabitch Butters! You told me I was a ghost! How stupid are you?! So help me GOD Butters, I'm gonna get you back for this! I'm going to  Hey, that's bullcrap! How come Jimmy doesn't have to do it?! No room at the inn, Virgin Mary.  Up yours, Butters. Jimmy, Jimmy, what the hell are you doing, man? Dude, you don't just go up to a girl and ask her if you can stick your penis in her vagina. Ye-you have to ask her on a date, take her out for some Italian food. Sure, lots of times. I've been laid, like, five thousand times. I told you: a date and then Italian food. And then you gotta make her think you're a good listener. Why sure, they do this all the time in movies and TV shows. You go on the date and wear an earpiece, and I'll be nearby, secretly telling you all the right things to say.  Okay Jimmy. First off, tell her how good she looks.  Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy, even though what she's saying now isn't interesting at all, you say, "Wow, that is very interesting. Please tell me more."  All right, when she stops yappin' again, say "Wow, I've never thought of it that way before, but you're right." All right Jimmy, when she finally shuts her trap again, I want you to repeat whatever she said, and then follow it with "Wow, how insightful." Yes, nice, Jimmy, very nice. Aaagh!  D'you know what you are? You're all a bunch of fucking cock roaches! You need people like me! You need people like me so you can point your fucking finger and say "That's the bad guy!" Well say goodnight to the bad guy!! Yeah. Isn't this fun? Just you and me hangin' out, Stan. No stupid Kyle around. You know how? Well here.  Roy keeps the keys in the glove box. Nobody's gonna know. We just drive it around the marina real quick. Look, if anything happens, I'll take full responsibility.  Awesome. We're not moving. Maybe you have the parking brake on. Other way! Other way! Stan... beaver dam!   Dude! Stan! You are in serious trouble! I don't even have an uncle Roy! That was just some guy's boat I knew about. Look, it's okay. We weren't here. This didn't happen, okay. We were both at ''my house'' all afternoon long playing Tea Party. Okay? Now come on, we gotta bail!   Yeah. Shyeah, that was pretty funny. Hehey, no! We aren't the ones who built a town beneath a giant beaver dam, okay?! That's their fault! Well they should've gotten out of there! We did! Ah ah ah, ah, I know what you're thinking, Stan. You're thinking, you're gonna go tell Kyle. Look, I know you think he's your best friend, but Kyle is a Jew rat! He has his Jew ethics while he hoards his greedy Jew gold, and he will Jew you out if you tell him about this! Oh hey, Kyle.  Hngh, totally.  Aw crap!  Oh Goddammit you told Kyle, didn't you?! Oh, here we go. See? I told you! If you're so caring, Kyle, why don't you share some of your Jew gold with the people caught in the flood?! Why?  "Oh, you've gotta help those people. It's your responsibility." Help! Help!  Not so fast, Kyle. Hand over the gold! You know what I'm talkng about! All Jews carry gold in a little bag around their necks! Hand it over!  I'm not playing around, Kyle! If we survive this, I don't intend to live in poverty! Give me your Jew gold now! Yes, but you can live if you give me your Jew gold! The decision is yours, Kyle! I want... your Jew gold!   Hey! Wait up, you assholes! God!  ...Aw man.  Hehe, I broke the dam. Hehe. [''closes the door and comes downstairs''] Ah, gentlemen, thank you for coming. We don't have a lot of time, so I'll cut to the chase. The girls at our school have been hiding something from us, hiding something huge. What if I were to tell you that the girls have a device, which allows them to see... into the future. Thank you, Clyde. Uh, I'm afraid it's true. . I caught the following images on tape. I warn you, this images maybe be too shocking for young children. Video playback initialized.  Believe it. The girls can ask any question they want and it gives the answer. Freeze image!  Gentlemen, we have to get our hands on that device.  How is the incubation shield coming Clyde? Good man.  Any luck here? Good. Keep working. We want to know all we can before we try to operate it.  All right, gentlemen, our containment center for the time warp is nearly complete. All that's left for us to do is get the device from the girls and bring it here. Don't be a fool, Craig. Do you really think the girls are just gonna hand that technology over? Heidi Turner  is going to have a slumber party on Thursday night. There's no doubt in my mind the girls will be using the future-telling device there. If we... can get somebody invited to that slumber party, not only can we get a hold of the device, but find out how to use it. No, not a boy, but a girl. One of us is gonna have to go undercover, show up in school tomorrow disguised as the new girl who just moved to town. No, not like ''Juwanna Mann'', Kevin, okay? It's way cooler than that! Which is why we have to fake that boy's death. It's simple spy stuff, my friends. Take your top man, fake his death, then send him in disguised as the enemy.  Okay, it's ready! Step down, Butters.  Okay. One! Two!  Nice.    Now Butters, we don't know exactly what is that girls do at their slumber parties. But if they start, you know, lezzing out, just roll with it. Remember Butters, you must get that future-telling device from the girls at all costs! And just roll with it if they start lezzing out.  God only knows the horrors that go on in girls' slumber parties. Let's just hope Butters can survive it. That son of a bitch! Butters! Just what the fuck do you think you're doing?! You aren't there to have fun, you black asshole! You were supposed to be getting the future-telling device. Working on what?! Your dance moves?! Just do what you were sent to do, dickface!  Tango tango tango! We've got it! Let's get it to the containment center! Go!  aahahaha, we have the device now! The power belongs to us!  Gentlemen, this is a historic day for all of the boy, and mankind. In a few moments, we will know the future.  No, No! We don't have time for that, Stan. It's time to ask questions. Because I do, Clyde. I'm askin' the first question! Let's just start with something simple. Will Kyle die before he's twenty? Will you all shut up so I can do this!? Are you guys nuts?! After everything we've gone through!? Think of the power! Are we sure about this? We'll never know the future. Damn, Ken. I broke the egg. I tried to cover it up, tried to put it back together with modeling glue, tried to seal it with a soldering gun, but, I give up. I can't hide it, I broke the egg. ...No. No. That's why I'm here. I think you should still give Heidi an A on the project. You see, I broke the egg, not her. And so, I should get an F, and she should get an A, which means that together the grade should average out to C minus for both of us. Damnit! I knew you'd say that! You always have it out for me!  Mr. Garrison..., you've never been this cool to me before. ...Why are you doing this? What do you want from me? ...No.  Yes teacher.  This disease is called Gingervitus, and it occurs because ginger kids have no souls. Kids who have gingervitus cannot be cured.  vampires. I was getting to that, if you will let me.  Mrs. Garrison, I'm really havin' a difficult time with all these interruptions. Fine! In the meantime, shut your Goddamned daywalker mouth!  Informative if you want to die.   ''-ed a fine time to leave me, Lucille'' <br /> I'M GINGER! Help me! Hellp mee! And how could I become a ginger now?! I wasn't born like this! So I'm gonna stay like this forever? Agh, excuse me, Doctor, but it just so happens my mom loves me, no matter what I look like!  Mom?! Hey dudes, what's goin' on?  How is everything with you guys? Yes, well, it's interesting you should point that out, Kyle. I went to the doctor yesterday, and apparently I suffer from a small skin pigment deficiency. Actually, gingervitus is the medical term. Yes, Kyle.  The sun's rays are bad for my skin, so I need to be protected when I'm outside. Well, I'm glad we've gotten all that out of the way, and now we can just go on with our lives as normal. What do you mean, Kyle?  That's fine, just get it out of the way...  I'm grubbin'. What's it look like? Huh? But... it's me. Guys! Okay, look, maybe I'm ginger, but... I'm not like other ginger kids. I'm still me inside.  I want to thank everyone for showing up today. I've called this meeting because, I don't know about you, but for one am sick and tired of being discriminated against! Just because we have red hair, light skin and freckles, we're thought of as somehow less important, and it's bullcrap! Kids at school laugh at us, doctors call us "genetically inferior." The world needs to know that we are people, with feelings! And our parents love us for who we are! ...Riiight, exactly! We can't let this go on any longer! We should be PROUD of who we are! Think about all the great people in history who were ginger. People like...  Liiike... Right! Ron Howard! And uh... Aaaaand... Right! We already had him, but right! See? Ginger people go on to do amazing things in society! We need to let everyone in this school know that we are not inferior! That we are in fact beautiful, totally awesome, and super-smart. It's time for us to take back our pride! Red Power!  Red Power! Red Power! Red Power! We gingers are proud people! We are the noble descendants of great Americans like Ron Howard, and ...others! We will not be discriminated against any longer, for we are a great race!  Red Power! Red Power! Red Power! Red Power! Better red than dead! Better red than dead! That's right! This is bullcrap! We True Gingers are furious that the role of Annie is being minimalized! The bitch isn't ginger! She's just using makeup to look ginger! And pretending to be ginger with makeup is the worst thing anybody can do! There she is! Get her!  Die, you stupid bitch!  Can I get a Red Power? Oh yeah! That feels good, doesn't it? Feels good to be proud of who you are! Now I don't think I need to tell you there's a lot of hate out there. Hate for awesome people like us. And if there's one thing I've learned, is that the only way to fight hate, is with more hate! We are not the freaks of society, everyone else is! Gingers are the chosen people! The chosen race! And we must view the rest of the world as the lowlife, dark-skinned rats that they are!  We're fine, thanks. We're fine! You're welcome!! Now leave us alone!!  My fellow gingers! I envision a world in which there IS no hate! A world where everyone is ginger! And so, we must gather together every child who is NOT ginger, and ''exterminate'' them! Now go! Go out into the night and take non-ginger kids from their homes! We will eradicate them all with cages and tortures and a pit of lava to thrown them all in! Now I am not gonna live my life as a Goddamned minority! Are you with me?! My fellow gingers! The day of reckoning is finally upon us!  What we begin here, we will take worldwide, until the blood of every non-ginger child has been spilled!  No, we're fine! Thank you! Yes! We're good! You're welcome, now leave us alone!!  We will start... with the daywalker! Go on then! Say your last words! Okay fine, let him speak!   What have we become? D-don't you see? If we go and exterminate everyone who isn't ginger, then we're no better than they were for thinking less of us. Maybe we all have to learn to live... together. Right, but... but I've learned that we can't judge people based on what they look like. See I know, I know, but I I get it now. We we've got to live and let live.  ... Huh? Ss. Who? Oh him? Oh. No, that was just... Tha-that was about something else, totally unrelated. That's it! You've got it! ''Live together!'' ''The same, you and I!'' Yes, but I'm not going to die.  That's why we gotta get along, people! Aw man, I got a crappy AJ Feeley again! HA! Saving money, duhhh!  Hey, I know! Let's go play laser tag at FunPlex. Stan, don't you know the first law of physics? Anything that's fun costs at least eight dollars. Okay, be a Jew. We're gonna go play laser tag.  Stan, I just want you to know that I still hate Kyle more than you.  I'm all wet! Sweet! Haha! I'm totally wet! This is awesome!! Yes! Yeehehehes!  I think there's a sea lion show at 2:30. Why? Kyle, the show is over! The whale isn't gonna splash us any more, so who cares? Killer.  Okay, Kyle. We're gonna get splashed some more, but if you wanna go make love to the whale, that's fine.   Dude, these things are dumb. Let's go! Kyle, Kyle. Let it go, man. Come on, guys, let's leave Kyle with his stupid whale. You live on the moon? Twenty million? Just to go to the dumb moon? Yeah, we just have to keep him wet. He hasn't said a word since we brought him here. Hurry it up, dude, we have a rocket to catch. We have to hurry! Uh oh. Oh crap! There's more of them!  Yeah, I feel pretty awesome right now.  Ichi banzai Ichi banzai! Kya! I'm doing some sweet bun-sow moves.  I'm a little better than everyone else here. Nah-uh, I don't raku disciprine! Yeah, let's go. Sure, whatever dude.  Dude, what the hell is he doing? You know, Stan, I'd say your dad racksa disciprine! Man, that was such a bummer. Why? All right, Stan. Sure.  All students trying out for the All-State team to center court!  All right boys, now you're all here because you're the best of the best.  Uh, uh excuse me, Brof-Broflovski, is it? Can we talk to you for a minute?  You uh... You're the best player in your school, are ya? Yeah. Uh, look, kid, you've got great skills and a great attitude. But you're just not physically ...built for the game. Well, it's just that... Jew's can't play basketball.  Awright, kids, we've gotta work on that shooting! Come on! Who are you? Well, you're tall and black enough. All right, Broflovski, suit up! Broflovski, be ready to take over for Owens. All right. Broflovski, you're going in next possession.  Hey everybody, you're not gonna believe it! It's Mr. Garrison! Only it ISN'T Mr. Garrison! He- He's a woman now!    He's alive! Kenny McCormick! He's alive at the hospital!  Oowhoops Ah I don't know, just ignore him. Stay back?! Hell, my wife and child are in there! I don't know, but she is ''pissed''. Sir, how can it be that a first timer scores that kind of thetan level?? He registered OT9! I'm only OT7 and I've been in the church all my life! Sir? Nubanon. Allí. ("There")  Believe what?  What are you talking about? Sharon, have, have you seen Stan? Oh, Jesus, what has gotten into that kid?! Yeah, but when ''we'' did it we actually ''stood'' for something. I mean, remember Woodstock, Sharon? We actually did something there.  S-stan. STAAAN!  My son is in there! Duh-uh!  Stan! Stan! Sta-ogh. Ugh!  Eric, you were right. About the hippies. Could you... get rid of them for us now? Please. Some of our kids are in there. We should have listened to you earlier. We're just asking you to try. The whole town even got together and, and baked you a cake.   It's yours.  My God... I'm the... only scientist in town. You got a better idea, Steven?! Dammit, my son is in there! Well I... guess this is it, Sharon. Check. Vehicle shell holding!  The drill is getting too hot from all the hippies.  Somebody's gonna have to go outside and activate the backup boosters. Which cord is it? I'm a geologist! Nyugh! It's working! It's, it's working! Stan!  Heeey batterbatterbatterbatter heydn no hit no hit can't hit can't hit can't hit it can't hit it can't hit it. Good call, ref! Good call! What'd you say?! You want me to kick your ass right here?!   Whattaya wanna do, huh? Whattaya wanna do? I'm standin' right here! How do you wanna handle it? This is for what?! Arresting me for what?! I'm not allowed to stand up for myself?! I thought this was America! Huh?! Isn't this America?! I'm sorry, I thought this was America!  Heeey! Well somebody had to put that knucklehead in his place. Wha-what do you mean? I can fight anybody. I just need to train. I just need to get in the best shape of my life. Oh boy, they're really gettin' into each other's heads out there.  Yeah! Let's go, South Park! These Fort Collins kids got nothin'! Wooo!  Heeey batterbatterbatterbatter batteruuuuuuuupp batterbatterbatterbatter! Yeah! Attaway, South Park! They ain't swingin' at nothin'! Walk to first! Woo! Fort Collins can't play!  Come on, let's go! I'm right here!  Oh I'm sorry! Why don'tcha get 'im on chars in America, I'm sorry! Greeley sucks! Greeley sucks! What, is this a Communist country or something?! I thought this was America!  This is America! This is an honest America!  Can you believe it, Stan? State Championship game. It's... the greatest thing ever. I've worked hard, believed in myself, and now I'm gonna be fighting in a State Championship game.  This is gonna be the biggest fight of my life. They've worked really hard to get here, Chris, and, you know, I don't like to really "trash-talk," but, I don't think Denver has a chance. Well I think that there's a uh...  Oh my God.  Stan's little league game, I'm... I'm not gonna go. I just... don't think I can, all right? Because I'm scared, all right?!  I don't know if I can take this guy, Sharon. Look, I get what you're trying to do. You're trying to get me to realize that I ''have'' to fight him because it's who I am. I've lost the edge. I'm sorry, Sharon. But you have to take Stan to his Little League game alone.  It's over, Denver! South Park whupped your ass!   I didn't hear no bell.   Boy, that's just awful. Don't blame the mayor, Sharon. What about FEMA? Think this whole thing is really their fault. That's not important right now, son. What's important is figuring out whose fault this is.  Ladies and Gentlemen, if Global Warming has in fact already caused the Beaverton flood, then this is only the beginning. The effects are going to spread. What we are looking at is a global warming catastrophe the likes of which we've never seen.  My colleagues in the scientific community are still running tests, but... we believe it may happen... the day after tomorrow.  With all due respect, cliché dissenting Republican, the economy isn't going to matter... the day after tomorrow.    Stan! Get in the car! We have to evacuate!  Come onnn, come on! No, Stan, I'm afraid us adults just let you children down. We didn't take care of our earth, and now you've inherited our problems.   Go back, go back!!  Come on, we've got to board up that last window! Seal off all the doorways! We must try to protect ourselves from the global warming.  Listen, listen everyone! Nobody can leave this building! You go outside, and you'll die! By now, the global warming has... shifted the climate,  bringing on a new ice age. Within the hour, the temperature outside will fall to over 70 million degrees below zero! All we can do... is try to wait it out, as long as we can.  Stan?? Stan!!  Stan?? Stan, you're alive! Stan, you must listen to me! You must stay indoors! Do not try to go out! Global warming has brought in a new ice age! What is it, son? You just stay put, son! I'm coming for you! Do you hear me?? I'm coming for you!!  I'm going to Beaverton. My son is counting on me! You can't go out there! You'll freeze to death! All right, come on, both of you! We've gotta pull together every warm piece of clothing we can find. Feeling warmth is a symptom of the last stages of hypothermia! Yeah, me too.  Don't be a fag!  We have to try!   Two hundred and forty dollars?! What'd you do, break something?! Oh Jesus, the answer is no, Stanley. Stanley, do you have any concept of money at all? Money doesn't grow on trees, you know? Well, if you really think your life is so bad, Stan, why don't you take what you have out of your bicycle savings?! Yeah, well just like the rest of us, you have to make choices with your money. Do you want a bike, or do you not want to be depressed? Right now, Stan!  Stan! What the hell did you do?! All right, what the hell is going on here?! Look, we don't want our son to join your group, okay? Okay, Stan, it's late, go up to your room and get ready for bed! Let Mommy and Daddy handle this.  What?! Mr. Cruise? Mr. Cruise, come out of the closet. Come on, Mr. Cruise, this is ridiculous.  What did you say to him? Oh boy.  Mr. Cruise, you can't just stay in the closet, alright? You need to come out. Tom Cruise won't come out of the closet. Well, we CAN'T leave you alone because YOU won't come out of the closet! Wasn't L. Ron Hubbard a science-fiction writer? Stan, do you want to hear the great secret doctrine of life behind Scientology? All right, go ahead and tell him. Aw rats.   Hey, come out of there!  Oh hey, sorry boys.  Hey, see you Nelson. Well, I ran into Nelson from work. We were at the bar watching the game. Two-dollar margaritas! It was great. All right, come on, I'll drive you guys home.  Oh yeah, I'll be fine. I got some beers to keep my buzz going. I'm not drinking and driving, I'm driving while I'm drinking. Right, boys? ...Oh I gotta pee. Hand me that empty bottle, Stan. Stan, you need to learn some things about being a man! Now give me that bottle!  Shh! Trying to concentrate!  Oh yeah?  Get off my ass, dickhole! Aww crap!  Everybody just stay calm! I can handle this, no problem. I know how to deal.  What seems to be the officer, problem? Okay.  Okay, no problem. Easy. Ooof. There! I did it, see?! No problem! Do what?? Wull come on, that's impossible! Okay... Okay, hang on... Okay...  What? What did I do?!  What did I do?! Well uh, I'm, s'posed to tell you kids about how bad drinking is, um... I'd-did a little drinking and driving. As part of my punishment I'm... doing community service work at schools like these. Uh, you you shouldn't drink, because it leads to uh bad things. I was in jail for the night and well I guess I donno, I... Just don't drink but,... if you must drink, d-definitely don't drive. I've... definitely learned that firsthand, and uh, uuh, that's all, I guess.  Hi Bill.  Um, my name's Randy, and... I just, really like beer.  But, I don't know if I'm really an alcoholic. Because I got a DUI and so I'm required to attend AA meetings for two weeks. I was stupid one night and drank too much and then drove a car. That was dumb and I'm not gonna do it again. What wait wait, hold on. I never knew that Alcoholics Anonymous was a religious thing. Look, I, I really just need to cut down on my drinking and never drive the car drunk again. Uh... a disease?  Oh my God...  Hello, Stan. No, Stan, you don't understand. I have a disease. Daddy's very sick. Yes, they're the ones that told me. I thought I could just quite drinking on my own, but... it's an illness, son. I have to admit that I'm powerless to this terrible disease.  I can't! I'm sick!  Stan. Stan I... need your help. Gotta try to take it easy from now on, son. Get Daddy another beer, will ya?  I know that! But this disease is just eating me up! I hate my illness! I wish it was that simple, son. But if I don't give myself up to a higher power, this disease is going to kill me dead. I'm afraid the only thing that will cure me... is a miracle. Cure... cure disease. STAN!!  I gotta drive to Bailey.  No, Stan, you don't understand. There's a church in Bailey. The statue of the Virgin Mary is bleeding out her ass. They say her divine ass blood has miraculous healing power. She can cure my alcoholism! I'll be back soon!   This is my only hope, Stan! Either you drive this car or I will! I sure hope this works. No. No, it ''will'' work! I have to put my faith in a higher power. I HAVE to believe that this will work!  There! There's the church! Stop right here, Stan! Right here is good! Brake pedal! Left pedal!  Is this the line?  Is this whole line people waiting to be cured? I know exactly how you feel. I've got alcoholism. Wait a minute. Stan, isn't that Josh Garrett up there? He's from South Park. Maybe he'll let us in line with him. I could die waiting in this line, Stan. Come on, let's go!  Heeey heh, Josh Garrett. How you doin'? I've got a disease: Alcoholism. It's pretty serious. You? We are the same, she and I. This is taking too long! I'm gonna run out of beer! Stan!  You see that guy up there? I think he has a kidney disease. Every couple of minutes he gets out of line to go to the bathroom. When he leaves next, let's take his place. The guy behind him is blind! There he goes! C'mon! C'mon! Go go go!  I'm going to die! Please, officer, you have to understand. I need a miracle way more than these people. I'm an alcoholic, and I'm powerless over it. Oh bless you, sir! Bless you!  Good morning, family. The Lord has truly blessed us with another beautiful day.  I've got another AA meeting today and guess where it's gonna be, Stan. At Whistlin' Willy's Pizza, so you can come with me. Stan, those people drink. I have new friends now. My AA friends, who have faith in a higher power. Boy this lemonade is great! Who knew how fun being sober could be?! 'Scuse me, I-I'd like to address the group if I may.  I'm Randy and I'm an alcoholic. But I put my faith in a higher power and... I haven't had a drink for five days now!   What? That means... I'm ''not'' cured. I still have the disease!  Come ON! Let's GO! You heard what he said!  The higher power didn't cure me! I'm powerless again!  I'm sorry, son! I'm off the wagon! But the statue wasn't a miracle! You're right, Stan. If God didn't make me stop drinking then... I did. Maybe... Maybe I ''can'' force myself to never drink again.  No?? But, maybe... I'm just the kind of person who needs to have it all or nothing. How did I manage to raise such a smart kid? Thanks son. Oh. Well, tell you what: let's leave the car here, walk home, and watch the game. Like to have another beer or two.  Well how about four? How about twenty? Right right. Does vodka count? Hello everybody!  Hi gals!  You guys try those new wings tampons? Do those work well? Hello, boys! It's me, your teacher! Mrs. Garrison!   Hello, Mr. Slave.  Would you like to take this beautiful woman to bed?  Nu- no thanks? Come on, Mr. Slave, I wanna try out my new snootch. Well, I ASSUMED you supported me. It's still me; I just have a vagina instead of a penis. Don't you even care that I was suffering? I wasn't happy the way I was! Look, we can still be together. All you have to do is stop being gay! I'm not gay! I'm a woman! Oh, so is that it?!  Oh jeez, should I do it?! Should I do it?! Oh what the hell!  Wooo! Huhuh, wooo! Look, I'll giggle and make them bounce up and down!  Heeheeheeheehee, heeheeheeheeheeheehee.  You know, the strange thing is, I haven't gotten my period yet. Is there a reason a woman might miss her period? ...Pregnant?  You here for an abortion too?  Yeah, I discovered a few days ago I wasn't bleedin' out ''my'' coo, so I guess I'm knocked up. Is this doctor any good? Oh, that's me.  Hello doctor, looks like I need an abortion.  Yeah, I've got one growing inside me. Now, are you gonna scramble its brains or just vacuum it out?  ...If you want you can just scramble it and I'll queef it out myself.  Mrs. Garrison. Don't you tell me what I can and can't do with my body!  A woman has a right to choose! But I missed my period.  You mean, I'll never know what it feels like to have a baby growing inside me and then scramble its brains and vacuum it out? But I paid five thousand dollars to be a woman. This would mean I I'm not really a woman. Ih, I'm just a... a I'm just a guy with a mutilated penis! ...Oh boy, do I feel like a jackass. Hey asshole! You told me you were going to make me into a woman! Yeah?! Well what kind of woman can't have abortions and bleed out her snatch once a month?! You made me into a FREAK is what ''you'' did! And I want you to change me back! Why the hell not?! You WHAT?! Oh you! You're comin' with me right now to find my balls and scrotum right now, Mr. Man!  Boys, have you seen Kyle?! He's not at home. What? Oh Jesus! Come on, boys! We've gotta get to my balls before Kyle hurts himself!  We don't have tickets! Look, there's a boy with my balls in his knees and he's in serious danger!  That dolphin has my scrotum! Now let us in! Gerald, where's Kyle?! My balls are in his knees. If he jumps with them they'll explode! Which one is he??  NO!   Hey guys! This girl is staying a woman! Who wants to pound my vadge! Girl power! Godspeed!  We did it! We did it!  Children, children, we have a very special announcement.  Tolkien is going to sing in front of a huge audience at the Miss Colorado Pageant in Denver. And for doing it he's gonna be paid two hundred dollars. Now of course, as a woman, I'm a bit against those chauvinistic pageants, but I hope that you children take a moment today to congratulate Tolkien for being so special. Just between us girls, nothin' gets my vadge wetter than a black man singing. Get your man-hands off of me! Don't worry, Jimmy. We're not laughing with you, we're laughing AT you.  Welcome students and parents to the annual South Park Elementary Talent Show!  Okay, that was the Goth kids with "Talent Shows Are For Fags" Okay, very nice, Clark and Laura. Very nice.  Our next act is Butters, who will be singing a song Okay, thank you Butters, very nice, short and sweet.  And now we have Eric Cartman, who will be doing select readings from the movie, ''Scarface''.  Okay, very nice, Ike, thank you. All right, children, it looks like we have no more contestants, which means, the Talent Show is over!  Now we will tally up the judges' scores and find out which act they hated the least. Okay, let's put our hands together for Jimmy Valmer.  I'm in pretty bad shape. My... leg is broken and my... left boob is leaking But... we need supplies, food, silicone. Okay, children, this week we are all going to learn about parenting.  Heidi, you'll be with Eric. Annie, you'll be a family with Timmy. Millie, your husband is Craig. Powder, you and Kenny are a loving couple now. Aaand let's see who else we have here, uh... And, Wendy? Wendy will be with Kyle.  Just let me say what I came here to say. I know we had a falling out and... things were said that... shouldn't have been said. I want to apologize for calling you a faggot. Well, wait, wait, it gets better. I've forgiven you for walking out on me after I had my sex change, and uh...  And I'm ready to take you back, Mr. Slave! Well, give us a kiss!  What the hell is he doing here?! Well, that didn't take you long, did it?! Yes! Married?! You can't get married! You're faggots! Mr. Slave, I am legally a woman now! If you wanna get married, you have to marry ME! Oh, that's just great! They're gonna let queers and homos get married, huh?! We'll just see about this, you fudge-packin' fags!! I'll stop that gay-marriage law!   These homosexuals think they can just step all over our traditions! Well I say: Marriage is a holy sacrament between a man and a woman!  They passed this law behind our back! We need to tell the governor and the world that gay marriage is not okay! That homosexuals cannot muddy our traditions! And there is only one way for us, all together, to make that message very clear! We need to round up three or four queers and beat the livin' hell out of them!  Come on, everybody! Let's get some queers, and some trucks, and have us a good old-fashioned fag drag! Appeal to the Governor? Oh,come on! Where's your balls?! Fag drag!  Eh fah, fag drag? Governor, we have collected over one thousand signatures requesting that you veto this gay-marriage bill! Because you're the governor? Well, think of the children! If you allow gays to get married, then you're also givin' them full rights as parents to adopt. You think kids can be raised by queers??  But, if you had such a study, a scientific study which proved same-sex couples are incapable of raising a child...  Mr. Governor, I will get you that study.  You've all been doing a great job taking care of your eggs, but now we're going to mix it up a little. Wendy and Kyle will no longer be together. Let's see what happens when we put two same-sex couples together to take care of an egg, shall we?! Kyle, you are now with Stan! And Wendy is with Bebe!  Come on, Bebe. We'll take your egg for you and Wendy to look after. And we'll just take this egg for Stan and Kyle to look out for.  Wendy, we're doing an experiment.   And if not, we'll certainly prove a point to that goddamned Governor, won't we?  Never mind, just carry on, children. Just carry on as two reckless little boys will. Okay, children, it's Wednesday! Time for an official egg check! Heidi and Eric?  Okay, Annie and Timmy?  Powder and Kenny?  Now how about our ''gay'' couples? Stan and Kyle? What?  Are you sure you didn't break it and switch eggs on me?! Where's my signature?! Two boys can't possibly take care of an egg! It isn't fine! It has two daddies! You call that fine?! It may be fine on the outside, but inside it's confused and embarrassed! Look at the freak egg! It has two daddies!  Two daddies! Two daddies! Come on, class, let's rip on the freak egg! Two daddies! Two daddies! Damnit, damnit! Stan and Kyle's egg is still doin' fine! Those little assholes are screwin' up my entire plan!  What the hell is this?! You broke your egg?? Uh but you're partnered with a girl. Did you tell anyone else about this? Did you tell your egg partner, Heidi? I can't do that, Eric! You have to get an A, Eric. Here: I'll sign this new egg for you. We'll pretend this never happened, all right?  Go enjoy the rest of your recess. ...Okay, well, you're welcome, Eric. Now, just run along.  Because I'm a nice teacher, all right? Nothing! It's all okay! Just take your damn egg!  Eric, you've never been anything but a problem for me! You're taking that egg! And if you break it again, I'll break both your legs, and burn down your house! Do you hear me?!  Urrgh, this scientific study isn't turning out the way I planned! Looks like I'm gonna have to... intervene. Are you Jakartha? Mrs. Garrison. I spoke to your associates on the telephone. I have a little... problem I need taken care of. I heard you're the best. It's an egg. I can pay two thousand now, three more when the job is finished. I don't care. Scramble it, fry it, do what you will! It has to look like an accident. What's the matter? You... afraid you can't do it? Can't say that I blame ya. That egg has caused me nothin' but problems since day one!  I guess... you're not as good as they say you are... Then why are you scared of one little egg?! That's more like it!  Thank you, Governor. Ladies and Gentlemen, with the help of some adorable fourth-grade students, we've completed our scientific, ''non-biased'' study of fags having kids. Come on up, children.  The parents were grouped together as male and female. As you can see...  Yes, what is it?! I'm a little busy!  What?? Y-your... you're too late! No you can'- Hello? Hello!!  You told me you killed that freak egg!! Well it's here! You'd better make damn sure it doesn't reach these steps uncracked!  The the egg that the two boys were given just- In conclusion, Governor, you can rest assured that-!  Noo! Noooo!! Okay, very nice, Tolkien. Thank you. 'K kids, looks like we only have time for one more speech today, so let's have uh Eric. Kyle, let Eric give his presentation. Kyle, if you wanna debate Eric, you can do so with ''your'' paper tomorrow! Okay, very nice, Kyle. A little dry and science-y for my taste, but there you go.  All right, that's lunch, kids. We'll pick up with Clyde's speech about lesbian cheerleaders after recess. Okay children, let's take our seats.  Oh that's very interesting, isn't it, kids?  ...Well, I think we've all learned an important lesson, haven't we, class? If you don't make the right choices in life, you could end up being a big loser like Stan's dad.   What? Th'um, nuh-nothing. I- I'll explain it to you when you're a little older. Your teacher had a sex change?? Oh my God!  That does it! I'm taking you boys OUT OF THAT SCHOOL!  He's a teacher! How are we supposed to explain this to our children?! Oh, just great! You see, Sheila?! This is what your transgender progressive thinking gets you! Now your son wants to be transracial! KYLE, YOU'D BETTER STOP BEING ANTI-SEMITIC RIGHT NOW, MISTER!!  Oh, that does it!  Who the hell do you think you are?! What kind of nutjob would agree to surgically alter my son into a tall African-American?! Huh that's right! And I also happen to be a lawyer! And I'm gonna have you sued for malpractice, and your clinic shut down!! What th- Look, they're- They're dolphins! Why? A b--uh I love dolphins, Ever since I was a child I dreamt of... Huh b-b-b- But that has hardly any bearing on what I'm hear to- ...What?  ...No.  No, no, it's crazy. That doctor is a miracle worker, Sheila. Iiii'm the happiest I've ever been.   I used to think I was crazy. But Dr, Biber told me that there are a lot of other people out there who are transspecies. All I did is change my appearance to look the way I felt...   Come on, Kyle, we should get going! Alright Kyle!  Excuse me, where do you have special seating for dolphins? Eh excuse me, where, where is the bathroom for dolphins? Well where the hell am I supposed to go to the bathroom? I I need a large tank with salt water. Damnit you people have to make special arrangements for transspecies people like me! I may be a dolphin, but I'm also a lawyer! What? Why?? Oh my God!   Mrs. Garrison, grab Kyle! Stop the game!  So, does this mean I'm not really a dolphin?  We'll wish we spent the money when we have a lawsuit on our hands. Congratulations, boys! You're goin' on to the post-season. Woohoo! Boy, that was great, wasn't it?! How much was bail this time?  Yeah, those dads get REALLY drunk and obnoxious. We're so proud of you kids! Geez I really wish this guy would shut up. Shh, shh! We've got the television working!  And... the rest of the country? Randy! We've looked everywhere! Kyle's missing too! I'm going with you. You can't do this alone! Stephen!  Stephen, you have to keep moving! Oh Jesus...  I feel warm too! Maybe we should... strip these jackets off, and warm our bodies next to each other! Penis! Vagina! ''I have a Yankee Doodle sweetheart,''<br />She's my Yankee Doodle girl.<br /> Gerald, that is very closed-minded of you! You shouldn't judge people who want to change.  You see, Kyle, sometimes a person' outside doesn't reflect who they are on the inside. They feel like they're somebody trapped in another person's body. And so, they can have a surgery  that makes them more into the person they see themselves as. Do you understand? There. You see, Gerald? He totally understands. What?? Absolutely not, Kyle! Yes, but Kyle- Kyle, you have to accept your body the way it is. The answer is NO, Kyle! You're NOT going to have negroplasty! Where are you going?!  Gerald! What happened to you?! A dolphin?!?!  Gerald, this is crazy! We we need you to take care of them, Eric! They're out of control! Well, we can promise not to buy one for Kyle, but we-we can't make him watch you play th-  Oh yes! Fine! We'll force Kyle to watch you. Look out for yourselves! Who's that? Mr. Garrison, are you all right? Kyle!   Kyle bubbe, we're taking Ike to the new Harry Potter movie. Wanna join us? All right. Well, there's pizza in the fridge if you and your friends get hungry.  Oh yes, that's my bubbe. Kind of a bad drawing though. I'm sorry, he just left. He's on his way to Mexico. Yehhs. As part of a school project, he's helping his class to move two donated grand pianos to needy school children in Tijuana. My little bubbe is very caring. No thanks. I can't believe you just went ahead and had that surgery without even asking me what I thought. But I'm gay! I don't like vaginas! It's great that you feel better, but you never stopped to think about how other people around you would feel! How can you say that?! You're gay too! Oh, Jesus Christ!  Mr. Garrison! Ohoh, Jezuth! That's, that's wonderful, Mr. Garrison! Ooooo... Mr. Garrison, Al and I have been living together for a few months. No!  Mr. Garrison, there's something you should know. Al and I are getting married.  Oh, Jesus Christ. We're getting married right after the bill passes on Saturday. Okay, that's enough. Out, Mr. Garrison. Oh my God, you're just saying that because you're jealous. We wanna be treated equally!  Oh, Jesus Christ. ''If I could swim with the dolphins, the soft and gentle dolphins...''Why can't I swim with the dolphins? ''...and the home of the... brave! [the lights come up and everyone cheers. The teams take the floor for the jump ball.

''I see a ladybug''- Hello lady ladybug.  Well yeah, but... we usually win. Yeah. My dad always said "It's Okay to lose, but if you don't try, wuh you're grounded, Mister."

Well... how do you know you're supposed to go to Heaven? Well... how do you know you're not supposed to go to... you know... Heck. Oh. I can't. Ahah, I have school tomorrow. Helll- Uh all right. All right, I'll help you! Mrs. Cartman? This is going to seem very strange and, and you may not believe me, but, well, your son wanted me to tell you something. He says, he love you.  He wishes he would have been a better son sometimes. He he got caught, he got caught up in the rat race of, of taking things for granted. Kyle, Eric wants you to know that he's, he's sorry for all the times he made fun of you being a no-good stinking Jew.  He's asking for your forgiveness. And and he wants you to just remember the good times. He can't! Don't you understand?! God forgave the Jews, you should be able to forgive him! Uhh alright then.   Aww, that's okay, Eric. So I won't see you again? Wow. Yeh you're still here. Well, I guess saying goodbye wasn't enough. Well, well, you know, the preacher says that before your soul can be at peace, sometimes, you have to atone for something bad you did. Did you ever do anything really bad?  Broke fence... Boy oh boy, Eric, you've got a lot to atone for. Really. I mean, honestly, I don't know ''how'' you're gonna make up for all this. Does this mean... you have to go now? Oh jeez. I I guess maybe your soul is stuck here for a different reason. Eric! Calm down. I-I-it wasn't me! Ih it was the ghost!  So... the ghost ''was'' in my head. The whole time. Yes! Uh yes sir! I believe you.  AAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Please leave me alone, Eric. My bottom is really sore. Eric, ye-you're just an image in my head brought on by a traumatic event. Wuh I hate my stupid psychotic brain!  Hello, ma'am. May I talk to you? Well, there's this ghost, see? Only it probably ''isn't'' a ghost, ih-it's just a delusion brought on by my trauma. Well I'm supposed to heh, help him, find out why his spirit is wanderin' the Earth, even though I know that I'm most likely just completely insane. Really? Well, he's sittin' next to me right now. Hey, I think she could see you too. You really ''are'' a ghost. Go in there? Uh, but they'll see me. Eric.  Well, be careful, ghost pal. Hurry. Go, go!  Boy, we sure did. Yeah. Uh I feel that way too. I'll miss you too, ghost pal. Huh? Huh but I thought you ''were'' one! Oh hamburgers.  M'boy, did you see that first prize for the talent show? Why you must be excited! You'll probably win like always.  Hey, who's droppin' bombs in there?! How about a courtesy flush?! ''Lu Lu Lu, I've got some apples, Lu Lu Lu, you've got some too.

What if they find out I ain't a girl? Lezzing out? What's lezzing out? Then I can go home and tell my mommy and daddy I'm not really dead? How about we read each other's future? Oh geez, are we gonna start lezzing out?  AAAAAAAH NOO! Witches! You're all witches!  Huh? Oh nothin'. Hey, you guys wanna tell each other's futures now?  Nobody likes meee... You don't know how hard it is to be me.  You think I'm ugly-ehehee... You said I'm ugly and flat.  You mean it?  Hello? Well, I'm just having some fun with my girlfriends. Well, I'm workin' on it. Now look! I'm getting pretty sick of this! Well I put myself through a lot, and you can't talk to me like that! Uh... mom. Ah. Uhh, could I hold that? How?  No! That darn device is nothin' but trouble! Ah I'm done, and I'm goin' home to tell my Mom and Dad I'm not dead!  Hello? Mom? Dad? Uh, it's me, Butters. I'm back.   Uh, I guess you're probably a little surprised to see me. Hi Dad. Mom, Dad, can I come upstairs now? Can I have something to eat? Well, I'm pretty hungry. Uh hello, I'm Butters. Huh? Can I just have some Spaghetti-O's? Oh! Daywalkers! That was a very informative speech, Kyle. Well okay! Let's do it! Shouldn't we get him back in the water? Oh hamburgers! What is that??  Oh, now we're gonna get it. Look! The Mexican border! Well, see ya, fellas. Uh I've gotta get home before my parents wake up. Wow. Go! Go! Get in the containment field!  Nah dude, then it won't be fun to watch. How could be nothing but trouble? Can't believe it. Not all that bad? How could you say that?! You hate this game more than any of us! All the other teams are worse than us. But who? He's perfect. Hey, I hate Cartman too. Can I ignore him with you? What? I... don't believe it. Let's go take it! He got it! He got the device!  I wanna use it. You shut up, asshole. Maybe we should take it so someplace safer. You know the rule. No ginger kids in the cafeteria. Hey, that whale talked to me too. After everyone left the show I walked up to the glass and he started talking. Well I thought I was crazy. He said my dad was gonna sneak into my room naked one night and beat me up. ...So it's true. That was it? That was you guys' whole plan? Ask the Russians to take the whale to space? Did it hurt? Like that motorcycle kid in ''Bad News Bears.'' I never realized ignoring him was an option. Yeah Eric, we're gonna stop ignoring you now.  It's occupied.  I don't know. I got this emergency letter from Cartman that said to meet in his basement.   NOW ''DAMN'' YOU, LET HIM ''SPEAK''! Where did they get that thing?  It's all set. Once we have the device, it can be housed in here safely until we know what we're dealing with. Nice. You're gonna be fine. Good luck, man.  Then, he's already dead. How come you get to use it first? Ask if the Broncos are gonna win on Sunday. Yeah. Forget about the girls. What about if the CIA or, or the Russians know we have this? They'll come after us for sure.  I am.  You're not supposed to be in the cafeteria. Right. And you're a ginger.  Sorry. If we let one ginger kid in here, then the others are gonna start coming.  ...A whale. Talked to you. Well we can't keep the whale out here anymore, people are gonna see it! Whales are mammals; they don't need water to breathe, dumb-ass. Mexico has a space program? We're busted.  Oh Jesus, they're here! Yeah, me too.  Mrs... Garrison? Am I a man yet? We don't... have one. Ahhh- Too bad? You're a lawphin? Tickets please. What?  Sorry ma'am, no tickets, no entry. You can't go in, ma'am!  We have unauthorized entry on level one! There they are, next to that dolphin!  Stop them! They didn't pay the two-dollar entry fee! Hey, what the hell?! So let me get this straight. That woman over there was trying to get to her balls which were in the knees of a black child whose father is a dolphin. Sounds like an open and shut case. All right, let's head 'em out!  Stay back, people! Sir! More people in Beaverton are calling. They say they're trapped in floods and fire now. License and registration, please.  ...Sir, why don't you step out of the car for me? Sir, I'm going to give you a sobriety test. Stand over here, please?  And now touch your finger to your nose. Touch your finger to your nose. Just bring one hand to your nose, like this.  Keep blowing. Keep blowing.  Keep blowing.  Aw Jesus! What's goin' on here? ...I understand. My, my brother's an alcoholic. Here, let me push you to the front of the line.  Hippies? Oh my. Oh, well they showed up a few days ago, but I didn't think they were hurting anything. Oh dear. Oh, well, so, so what do I do? Ooooo...what's that?  Whoa, how did I get here? Man, I'm so high. Whoa, dude! Not cool!   Wow, my friend Brittany was right. This is a really laid-back place. Oh wow, you guys shouldn't be doing that. Don't you know what you're doing to the world? We just spent our first semester at college. Our professors opened our eyes. The government is using its corporate ties to make you sell magazines so they can get rich. Just hang with us for a bit. We'll fill you in on everything you haven't been told.  You see, the corporations take their profits and invest it in the war machine while keeping everyone blind. Well, so my idea was this: Let's have, like, a week long music festival, draw everyone here, and then together, we can tear it all down.  Who was ''that''? Wow, this band is so crunchy. Dude, I need more weed. You kids just haven't been to college yet. But just you wait, this thing is about to get HUGE. Oh yeah, level four, sweet! We didn't listen! I'm going as fast as I can. What the hell is goin' on?! Stolen? You kids told me you won that whale at Pizza Hut! Look, I didn't know nothin' about this.  I broke the dam. Well, we just heard that this miracle was happening and we wanted to see it for ourselves and come and pray.  What is your problem? Get lost, little Eichmann.    Yeah man, the corporations. Right now they're raping the world for money! Yeah, we'll have one guy who like, who like, makes bread. A-and one guy who like, l-looks out for other people's safety. More tunes. More tunes!  Let's bail on this whole angry scene.   We must respect the wishes of people's BFFs. Otherwise, all our BFF necklaces would become meaningless That's right! We know whose fault this is! It's George Bush's fault!  My name's Bill, and Im an alcoholic.  The corporations run the entire world. And now they fooled you into working for them. Oh my God! And I broke the dam. Well it may represent her sorrow over all the bad things going on in the world. It it sure is. (Sonofabitch!)  (Hey, terrific!) (All right!) (What?!) (Wing?)  (Friday) (I could get to level sixty!)  (Hey, that's odd.)  (What the fuck is going on?) (Me?) (That I ''what''?) (All right. How am I supposed to do that?) (Yeah, fuck him!) (Fuck yeah!) (Me too.) (That guy would try anything.) (So?) (Our egg is okay.) (What's a great idea?) (Hehe, yeah. Hehe) (Hehe, yeah, heh)  (AH!) (Hey yeah!) (What the fuck are you talking about?)  This is a really nice town you have here. That's why the corporations are trying to use you to take it down. What the hell are you doing?!  Right now we're proving we don't need corporations. We don't need money. This can become a commune where everyone just helps each other. No no, can't you imagine a place where people live together and like, provide services for each other in exchange for their services? Hey, what happened to the tunes, man? This is killing my buzz. We all have BFFs, and we believe that a BFF is the highest legal authority. Yeah! George Bush doesn't care about beavers! Well uh, we were thinkin' we would, you know, just go appeal to the Governor.  Huh? O-ah... Two hundred. Two hundred... dollars. You have to admit you're an alcoholic. It is a disease because it's a physical dependency. That makes it a disease.  It is time to let us out! I'm sending your names! Open this door right now! What are you doing, man?! What's up, man?! You can't keep us down here like this!  Just go with it? We've been down here for days!  This music is so angry.  What's wrong with you?!  What makes you think ''you'' could tell us where to live?! This is a free country, man!  Stan, sweetie, we're gonna go to the mall. Do you wanna come? Okay, sweetie. He went with his friends to that music festival. Now, Randy, we were the same way once, too. Don't forget that we were both considered hippies back in the '60s. You ate too much acid, man!  ...Oh my God. Our son is with those people. Please, save our boy, Randy. Randy, sit down. Randy, don't! Randy... What? Why? You don't think you can?! This is the biggest game of your son's life! Why wouldn't you go and support him? What-?  So then, don't. You don't have to get in fights with other parents at Little League games! Just sit there and watch! No, I'm telling you you don't have to get thrown out of games and make an ass of yourself. Get up, Randy! Fight! Fight for me! Hi boys. Uuh uh uh, not so fast. You boys can help bring in the other groceries in the car, then have your chicken. It won't take a minute. Oh my gosh, those poor people.  You all done with your fishsticks, Stan? I don't know. You know, to me, it seems like the mayor of Beaverton should've done something about that dam years ago. It's useless. This traffic isn't moving!  Here you go, sweetheart. I know, but, I'm afraid it's too late for them, sweetie. We have to try and save ourselves now. Oh my God! Where would they go?! They, they've got the boys! Stanley!   Stanley. You? Stanley, you haven't touched your food. What's the matter with you? What? Why? Well how long have you been feeling this way? Stanley, I didn't know you were miserable. Uh, Stanley, take the garbage out before you go to bed. Wwhat?? What's going on? What?? This is just too much. All right, people, we can move onto issue number 14B. Kid, we're have a city council meeting. Kid, what the hell are you talking about? Johnson, get him out of here.  I know. I signed the permit. I signed a permit allowing them to have their concert here. Their little "festival" should pump some money into our economy. They don't have to know. I can sign whatever permit I want! That kid really needs some psychiatric help. All right, let's go. What have I done?  They still have a long way to go! What's happened? That's it. We're going to Plan B. Nuke the crowd!  Mayor, we have got to do somethin' about all these potholes on our roads! We-  Yeah. We apologize. Yeah, yeah! I get it! Fine!  Now, now, don't cry, ladies. Everything's gonna be fine. ...I didn't volunteer! ...Aw dammit!  I'm alive!   We don't have it in the budget to fix them right now. You can't go in there!  It must have been taken while I was going to the bathroom.   I DON'T KNOW! A what? Steven, what do we do? I'm your engineer. I have to do it, Steven. Butters, if anything happens to Mommy, I, I want you to be a good boy. Online It's useless. The main power line has been shut down. We made it! We don't have time to argue! They're gonna nuke us! What? Butters, what on earth are you doing?? Dead people? Oh, Stephen, I don't know if we should ground him or call a doctor. What do you think, Doctor? Oh no.  NO!  What?! Oh my God, Butters! He, h-he's coming down! Oh thank God! OHHHH MY GOD!! NOOOOO!! NOOOOO!! My son is DEAD!! NOOOO!! NOOOO! NOOOO! BUTTERS!  Don't put him down there! Don't put him down there!  Stephen, you did what?? You dug up our son's body? Performed some kind of pagan ritual? Not like this!  Keep the door locked. Oh God...  It isn't right! Make it go away! He was supposed to stay dead! It's... hungry. Yes. The basement. What are we becoming?! Uh, Eric, we're, we're talkin' about potholes right now, m'kay. Uh huh hi Eric, uh, how's it goin'? We know you can do it, Eric. You're smart. Wha- why you're the smartest kid in school, m'kay? They, they s- they stopped. Something's wrong. M'kay, kids, as your counselor, I know it can sometimes be difficult to talk about subjects like drugs and sex and alcohol, m'kay? So, as you remember, last week I told you to write down any difficult questions you had and put them in this box anonymously so we could discuss those questions in class, m'kay? I got a lot o' responses, so let's read some aloud.  then we'll just do drug identification exercises, unkay?! M'kay, uhh, Jimmy, why don't you come up here and write down the names of two narcotics? Jimmy, I'm not asking you, I'm telling you! Well why the hell not?! It's what... Oh, you do? R-right now, right now it is? M'kay, m'kay. Don't worry, Jimmy.  N'kay, uhhh, let's pick someone else. Um, Eric, why don't you come up here? Well, because uh, Jimmy is pitching a tent right now.  Huh?  Oh oh oh, right. Quiet, children, quiet! We need to hear. Randy, wheh-where are you going? Hey, look everybody! Helicopters!  So does, does this mean the storm is past. Global warming's over? Well, that sounds pretty reasonable, m'kay.  There you are! Eric Cartman, you are under arrest. I was just over at your house and freed sixty-three people you had locked in your basement. Oh no, you're coming downtown!  You can't kidnap people and lock them in your basement. I handled it, Mayor. Gee whiz. Yeah. Jimmy? Jimmy Valmer? Jimmy, what are you doing here? The talent show is inside. Not perform?  But Jimmy, you love talent shows. Everyone in town knows that. Why? Well of course not, Jimmy. Little girls don't wanna have sex. Well, Jimmy, the girls here are young and pure. They're not like the ladies down at Colfax Point. Well yeah, those women will have sex with anybody. You're welcome, Jim.  Wait... Oh God. Is this problem under control? Thousands of people have descended on South Park for a hippie music jam festival. The event is said to be the largest such gathering in the history of man.  Fear and horror in South Park today as the music festival continues to grow.  They're arriving in droves and apparently no end is in sight. All right, welcome to Hippie Jam Fest 2005!  For too long, the corporations have bled the world of its love and resources! It is time for us to get to work and make the world a better place! And we're gonna start ''right now''.  Yeah, South Park is now hippie capital of the world!  And there are your finalists, the sixteen most beautiful women in Colorado. Here to sing for our sixteen lucky finalists, the winner of the Colorado Child Star Contest, Tolkien Black.  Tom, the crowd just keeps getting bigger and the town is literally bursting at the seams. We don't know where this music festival came from, but, it's very close to consuming us all. Tom, I'm standing in South Park, Colorado, where a desperate attempt to save the town is underway. Some call it a suicide mission, but the heroic men and women of the hippie digger may be our only hope of survival.  Tom, I'm standing here with the little sluggers and some of their parents, and I can't tell you how excited they are.  Little Stan Marsh is the pitcher for the South Park Little League team, and Stan, how does it feel to be playing for the State Championship? Mr. Marsh, you must be very proud of your son. What harm do you believe this actress is doing to the true red-haired community? This is getting pretty ugly, Tom. These gingers are really riled up! If you are a ginger and would like to join The Ginger Separatist Movement, you can attend their first meeting this Friday in the Sunset Room at the Airport Hilton.  Randy! Randy, you've got to get out of here! If they just trample this park, we'll be trapped! It's too dangerous! Please. Don't let them ruin our town. Anything else? Nice plan, kid, except there's one giant flaw. That hippie crowd is massive! How the hell are we supposed to get through it and reach the stage? They're in! Me?? Hey, chill man. It's all good. Have some water laced with acid. Fine.  Mr. Garrison, for the love of God. Mr. Mackey, it's over. You're... actually suggesting that somebody drives right into the heart of that mob? It's a suicide mission! Honey, no! I I can't believe we're actually listening to this. This is a crazy plan! Jesus... they're dead in the water.   God dammit, no! Y-you have to give them more time! All right! All right, yeah! We did it! We're using the power of rock and roll to change the world! Woo!  Oh man, not cool. Whoa! Awwwww! Aaaah. Ichi! Ichi! Ichi! Ichi! Ichi! Nothin' Yeah. I'm supposed to be home by 3:30.  ...Yeah? We were at why I should give you ten percent.  ''You'll never find...''As long as you live...Someone who loves you...Tender like I do... ''Whoa, I'm not braggin' on myself, baby''But I'm the one who loves you and there's no one else! No-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh one else. ''... (you're gonna miss my lovin')''I know you're gonna my lovin' (you're gonna miss my lovin')You're gonna miss, you're gonna miss my lo-o-ove. Here you go.  Thanks. Are you serious? Oh my God! Okay! Oh, come on, guys. You have to see what a huge opportunity this is for me. Send a cress in your plates, folks?   What, what are you doin' here? Yeah. Well, it turns out an agency doesn't really do anything for you.  I'm trying to work my way back home. No! Ignoring him? How come? Oh yeah. Pluto is also the furthest planet from the sun, though scientists believe more planets lie beyond it. I hope you enjoyed my report on the Solar System. Thank you.  Ginger kids eat in the hallway! What are you doing? ...What do we do?  Hey there my man, that was a great performance. Don Heisman, Creative Arts Agency in Los Angeles. I think you've got real promise.

We smuggled your wife into the United States for you. You were to pay us ten thousand dollars for that service. Yet, we have yet to be paid. It's too late for that, Mr. Kim. Your wife is now our property. We taking her to Los Angeles, where she will work in massage parlor.until she works off the debt. Where is she?! You're lying. Turn him around! You don't wanna tell us where she is? All right. Puh la! Ching ga wai pan!  Tell us where to find her, Ru Kim! You have no choice. You thought you could run from us, did you?    Enough!  I have a lot of respect for you boys finding your way in here. But you come any closer and I'll blow her brains out. This woman has a contract with us! We own her! Her life belongs to us!  Perhaps... you're right. We spend all this time... mooching off the hopes and dreams of others, forgetting that they are human beings.  I am tired of this business. It is a very dirty and perverse business. We quit too.  It's time for us to find another way to make money. From now on, all contracts we have on people are null and void. Yes, you were right, kids.

Oh, you've been so helpful, I uh, just don't know how to thank you. Ohoho, nhn. Yes?  Oh hi. Oh, what is it?  Oh, that's so nice. Oh, that's so sweet.  That's my little boy.  Eric honey, time to get up for school.   AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! Oh my God! Eric! You mean... Oh...  Oh ye-yes, of course,sweetie. Hey dickhole! What do you think you're doing? There's no saving place, fourthie! Get to the back or we'll beat your face in! "Congratulations! You have reached ...level nine!" You have reached level sixty! Kenny? Kenny, are you still playin' with that thing?  Kenny, it's been two weeks and you've done nothin' else! Who cares if you almost made it to level sixty?! You're wastin' your life, Kenny! If you died tomorrow, what would you have to show for it?! You're gonna end up wishin' you'd done more with your life, ''just like your dead-beat father''! I wasn't talkin' to you, asshole!!  I'd like to see you try! It's my house too, you no-good loser! Will he ever recover? He's alive. He-ee smiles when I talk to him. I think... He did? When? Look, Kenny, your friends are here to visit you again. What? No doctor! You can't!  Hey, I heard that, bitch!  How about I come in there and kick your teeth in! Goddamnit, do you have to smart off at me in my own house?! It's a miracle... Kenny, you're alive. He can't more on his own-ah how will he eat? I-I don't know if it's right to keep Kenny alive on that machine. I-I just... I don't know what he would want. Wha, what's the matter, doctor? Open the gate! Open the gate!  Welcome to the Kingdom of Heaven, Kenny. I am Peter. There isn't much time, Kenny. You're dead, but, your death was no accident. Heaven needs you. Come! There is much to discuss.  But knowing that Hell was becoming much larger, God decided to let more people cross over so that he could build an army as well, an army that YOU must command. The Sony PSP was built by God, to determine who on Earth had the best skills to defeat the armies of Satan. You... are the best. YOU, are the only hope for the universe. He beat Satan's army in over three thousand separate simulations. Satan's army has crossed over the Plains of Limbo! Kenny! Bless your soul! You've saved all of Heaven! Satan's army grows as we speak. The Dark Lord knows that our armies are few in number, and unorganized. So our only hope... is perfect strategy.  The child's soul is now trapped inside his vegetative body. We have no one to command the troops with the PSP. A child? This is God's solution? Archangel Michael, what say you?  Up here, you get the best tactical view to protect the fortress. It is from here, Kenny, that you shall command the armies of heaven.  This golden PSP is king of all PSPs. It works just like the ones we sent to Earth. All the commands you make will be sent to the troops down on the battlefield. All you have to do is play the game, Kenny. Only this time, It's for reals. Prepare the troops!  Where'd he go?  A feeding tube?! But... that's not natural. God intended Kenny to die! What are these people doing?! Oh, Goddammit.  Are you stupid, Uriel? Japanese people don't have souls! Kenny remains our only hope! Here is what we must do.  Hopefully, it will be long enough to get our Keanu Reeves back. Send our troops to the battlefield! I'll command as best I can! Oh my God, they killed Kenny! Get him into the command station! Hurry!  Yesss, good, Kenny! The angel spearmen are taking out their demon soul rippers! Oh, the cavalry angels are clashing with their Black Knights! Oh my God! My God, this battle is epic! Ohh, they're bringing in their demon dragons! Look at the size of them! My God, this is even bigger than the final battle in the ''Lord of the Rings'' movie! It's like, it's like TEN times bigger than that battle! Yesss. Yes, Kenny! Satan's forces are retreating! This is TRULY a sight to behold! OH I wish I had a camcorder!  Yes, Kenny! And to thank you for all you've done, we are going to give you a very special gift. For saving the entire universe from the forces of evil, we give you this.  As most of you know I once lost my job and my family because of my drinking. But with the help of AA I've been sober for ten years now.  Anyone have anything they wanna tell the groups, for starters? That's great. And I understand this is somebody's ''first'' AA meeting, is that right? ''[Randy points to himself]</> Y-yes, you sir. Stand on up and introduce yourself. Randy, you are powerless to make that decision. The only thing that works is the 12-step program.  Step 1 is admitting that you are powerless to control your drinking. Only then can you move on to the other 12 steps, like, believing that only a higher power, God, makes you stop drinking. And then, turning your life over to that God and, humbly asking God to remove your weaknesses.  Well it's not religious. You just have to admit that there is some kind of god which has power over you and turn your life over to that god and ask him for forgiveness. That's the 12-step program, not religion.  You just can't cut down on your drinking, Randy. You need to know something. You have a disease. That's right. Alcoholism is a disease. You're sick, Randy. You're very very sick. And just like with most diseases, you can't cure it yourself. And it's deadly. None of us are in charge. We're all powerless. He can't quit by himself. None of us could. He needs divine intervention. Spirituality. Young man, do you know anything about the 12-Step Program? Sure Randy, go ahead. Randy, uh what are you doing? My fellow damned souls! Now is the time for our assault!  You know no fear! You will drink the blood of angels! We go now! Nothing can stop us! My spy! Impossible! How?!  Oh Jesus Christ. What's the point?! They have a Keanu Reeves now. Very well.  I don't know if we should continue without knowing more about this Keanu Reeves God has.  Full march, to the Gates of Heaven! Victory is ours! What mockery is this?! The feeding tube has been pulled! If the child dies and his soul returns to Heaven, God will have his Keanu Reeves! Forget it! I'm calling the attack off! How? No! NO! How are we losing?!  Full retreat! No, Kevin!  Step aside! Step aside, I say!  Satan! God has mocked thee once again! God has found a way to defeat your army. A young man. Basically, he-he's like Keanu Reeves. My Lord. My Lord, we must attack, now! Do not fear, my Lord. Your army is great! Your army nears the Kingdom of Heaven, my Lord. My Lord... Perhaps the child won't die in time. No! Keep your army marching, my Lord. I will get that feeding tube put back in.  I will do what we always do: Use the Republicans.  Removing the feeding tube is murder, hughughughughughugh...  Who are we to decide if Kenny should live or die?  It is God's will that he live! No no, you don't say that part.  Patience, my Lord! Simple. You will use... this.  Hail the holy PSP. Gabriel returns with news! Hell's army is departing! They head now for the Gates of Heaven. Yes. Apparently they're using machines to keep them alive. And Satan's armies are approaching. Then they will be here on the morrow. Without Kenny's soul here there will be nobody who can use the holy PSP. Here is the hospital The tube has been removed? Good. Now all we must do is pray nobody interferes with the child's death a second time. No! Nono, see, they were playing God when they put the feeding tube IN! Michael! Michael!  The humans finally did the right thing! Doctor! Doctor, we have a pulse! Amazing, doctor! You've revived somebody who's been legally dead for almost a day! Boys I want to thank you for coming down to my office on such short notice.  No. Boys, I'm a lawyer. Your friend Kenny has passed away and I've called you here to read his will.  "In the highly likely event of my death, I, Kenny McCormick, wish to leave all my belongings to my good friends, Stan and Kyle. Dudes, you were the friends a guy could have." To Eric Cartman: "Eric, I never really liked you. But then, nobody does. You have no ability to feel, and you are going to die alone and miserable. It is only because I feel so sorry for you that I leave you my Sony PSP." There is one more thing I would like to ask you all, as my friends. If I should ever be in a vegetative state and kept alive on life-support, please,...  I don't know. I lost the last page.  It's right here, along with Kenny's other belongings. They're all yours. Satan! I come bearing good news! The Keanu Reeves boy has been revived on Earth! His soul is no longer in Heaven. The child's soul is in Heaven! God has his secret weapon! No! There is another. A Japanese boy did make it to level fifty-nine. Oh, right right, I'm sorry  This is hopeless, Gabriel. We cannot interact with anything on Earth, how could we possibly get a feeding tube removed? Apparently, some blessed child has done our work for us. No! No, no boys! Aw Goddammit!   No! No, they're not killing him, they're letting him die! Yeah Jesus, their army is massive. Yeah Heaven help us. Yeah The armies of Satan have already broken through the gate! Yeah, Uriel! We're gonna die!!! Well I'm sorry, young man, but the parents want their child kept alive. I don't believe you have any legal authority here. Kenny's BFF says that Kenny didn't want to be kept alive artificially. The courts have determined we must obey his wish.  That's all the verification we need. Pull the feeding tube, doctor. Best friends forever? Sir, take a look at this.  This is HBC News. A right-to-die case debate is heating up in Colorado,  Two boys are bringing national attention to this story by protesting outside the hospital. A woman was arrested for trying to bring food to the patient.  However, a growing number of people are also standing behind Kenny's BFF, Eric Cartman. The biggest battle of all time is about to begin: the battle of the feeding tube! As people on both sides of the argument vie for media attention. We've just received word that Kenny McCormick... has passed away. The debate still rages on in America, but at least now, Kenny... is in a much more peaceful place. Global warming appears to have struck as predicted in the Colorado Rockies! All around the country, panic and chaos are settling in! You bastards! You bastards! You bureaucrats have no right to play God and take that tube out! We Republicans are deeply saddened by the tragic events in Colorado.  Removing the feeding tube is murder! Who are we to decide if Kenny should live or die? It is God's will that he LIVE!  Haaghaghaghaghaghagha... No no, you don't say that part, haghaghaghagha.  Tomato! Tomato! Kenny! Kenny!  I found the page where Kenny specified his wishes about being on life support.  Yeah. Now batting for Conifer is little Allen Varcas.  That's it. South Park wins the game 4 to 0. Hit it out of the park, Allen! South Park sucks! That was no strike! What the hell is wrong with you, ref? Come on, Allen! This pitcher throws like a girl! You heard me, asshole! You want a piece of me?! 'Cause I'm pretty sick of your Goddamned mouth! You'd better shut up, asshole! I told you to SHUT UP!  Just look at those boys out there, lovin' the great game of baseball like we did when we were kids.  Yeah, our boys really stuck it to 'em!  Run kid, run! Strike. Strike three! You're out! Steerike! Ball! Steerike two! Strike three! You're out! Ball four! Safe! Strike three!  Strike three. You're out. Ball four! Strike three! ¡Strrrrike tres! ¡Ball cuatro, por favor!  R-right over here.  Strike 1! Strike 2! It's a bunt! Safe!  Out! Strike 1! Strike 2!  Stop! Stop, or you're gonna get your teams disqualified!  Well we won! That means we've got the best record in the division!  You're out.  Yeah, well, you'd better watch yourself in the playoffs. I mean, you always get in a fight with scrappy redneck dats up here in the mountains, but some of those Division Two dads are tough! Can you believe it, boys?! We're playing in the State Championship Game!  Well, then your whole season starts over, but on the national circuit! You get to spend your whole summer playing baseball! Then we'll spend the whole summer going to Nebraska, and to Iowa, and Wyoming. Keep running, kid!  Who's seeing dead people? Now, Butters, there's no such thing as ghosts. Butters, these things happen all the time. You've got a very active little brain and your mind was just playing tricks on you. Yeess. That's right. There's no reason to be afraid of things that aren't real. There's plenty of real things to be scared of. Like super-AIDS. That's right. A new form of AIDS which is resistant to drugs. Just one teaspoon of super-AIDS in your butt and you're dead in three years. So now you feel better? Ghosts don't exist and there's nothing to be afraid of. Except the super-AIDS. Butters, what is going on?! Well you'd better stop having nightmares or else you're gonna be grounded! Butters! What have you done?! No, I think you'd better call a doctor. I'll ground him. Now do you believe us, Butters?  Butters?!  Everyone into the community center! Hurry! Go!  This is all your fault, Jimbo! Yeah! You drive that damn SUV around! You didn't even think about global warming, DIDJA?! Jesus.  Randy, Randy! Your son's on the phone! Let me go too. I can't go on! Feel so... hot. Yes? What is it, officer?  Butters? Butters, whatever is troubling you, this isn't the answer. Look at all these people who've come out for you! Just come down, son, and... we promise we won't ground you for more than a couple of weeks. Linda? Linda, please come downstairs.  Who are you? Bring him back? W-What are you talking about? Indian... Burial Ground? You're saying if I... dig up my son's body and rebury him at the... old Indian Burial Ground, that I- Hello son. Don't you worry. Daddy's gonna make everything all right again.  Don't worry. We're gonna bring you back, son. We're gonna bring you back! I had to, Linda. If there was even the slightest chance it would bring him back! I don't know. I don't know what I'm doing anymore! Linda, I did it for you, you wanted him back so much! So did I! It's him.  It's gone, dear. It's gone. Forgive me. Oh God, it's terrible. What have I done?! Here. Here, you see? It's going to be all right. Hello... son.  Sorry, son, but... you're a demon spawn now. You're an abomination. Yes, it must feed.  Oh yes, thank you for coming. Just follow me to the basement.  Here you go, son. Eat! Come on. Don't watch it eat.   Herro, crisis and fear tonight, as what appears to be a massive flood has overtaken the town of Beaverton, Colorado, home of the world's largest beaver dam.  Any word on how the survivors in the town are doing, Mitch?  My God, you've, you've actually seen people looting, raping and eating each other? In the nearby town of South Park, the cause of the Beaverton flood is being investigated. At first, nobody knew what caused the dam to break, but now, shocking new evidence has indicated that the flood in Beaverton was caused by... global warming!  All the top Colorado geologists have gathered at the governor's office for an emergency meeting.  You can't go out there! You'll freeze to death! Global warming must be over! Thanks, Edward, that's a very shocking report... Yeah. Let's face it, we're winners. Hey fellas, w-where is Cartman?  Yeah. S-see ya, Eric.  Uh no, that-that's okay, Mr. Mackey. Uhhh, just uh ahh not right this second, Mr. Mackey. Uh...  Hey fellas. Oh I sure have. I've been working on my ruh... ruh... routine all year long. Well fellas, entertainment is my life. I love being in front of everyone.  Aaah! I gotta guh, I gotta go! See ya fellas.  Yeah. Yeah, I'm real excited. REAL excited... for some reason... Oh, Jesus! What's wrong with me? Fine, Mom.  What? Uh who told you that? Aw J-j-j-j...j-Jesus! Dz-n-Doctor Pal? Uh, sure? Well, a little, yes. But I have to make it stop! The talent show is this F-Friday. Ke...c-come again? N-no, I do NOT want to take off my shirt and kiss! Wow, what a what a great audience. So apparently Martha Stewart is out of jail. Have you have you heard about this, have you seen this? She's very excited to get started on her new show, "Martha Stewart Living, with an electronic ankle bracelet."  What a fantastic audience. Nuh uh! Wuh. Huh. Waaagh! Ungh!  Butters! Butters, ah I really need to talk to somebody, and I think maybe you're the only person who won't make f-f-fun of me. Butters, do you know what you're supposed to do when your penis gets hard? Really?? So, when your penis becomes hard, you're supposed to put it in a lady's vagina. And then it stops being hard? But where am I going to find a lady to stick my penis in? The talent show is this Friday. Hey Bertha. Well Bertha, I was wondering if I could stick my penis in your vagina? But the talent show is tomorrow!  Ooo! I'm trying to get laid. What's it look like? Wow, seems like you know a lot about this stuff, Eric. Have you gotten laid before? Well, wha-what do I do? Eric, I can't tell you why, but it's ''very'' important that I score to-night! Can you come on the date and help me? You're like a white... Hitch. Wow! Thanks, Eric. Hey Shauna. Wow, Shauna, you look f-fantastic. We're going to an authentic Italian restaurant, Buca de Fagghecini Uh, I think we're gonna try your authentic pizzareli casserona poppers. Wow, that is very interesting. Please tell me more. Wow, I've never thought of it that way before, but you're right. "If you're gonna be that way, I don't need to be your friend." Wow, how insightful. Really? Oh, I'm so glad you think so, Shauna, because I really wanna stick my penis in your vagina. But the talent show is tomorrow night!  Oh... Hi, Officer B b-b-buh b-b-buh b-Barbrady. I'm... not gonna perform in the talent show.  I just c-can't risk getting up in front of everyone. All right! I I keep getting an erection for no reason! Okay! But I can't get any of the girls here to let me... do it to them. Then why does God make it so that my penis gets hard if girls don't wanna have it in their vaginas? It's like a cruel joke. ...Colfax Point? Really? M-maybe I can catch the bus ...and get down there before the talent show ends. Th-thanks, Officer Barbrady!   Excuse me, ma'am. What's your name? Well, Nut Gobbler, I need to get laid. I have a raging hard-on that just won't quit, and the talent show has already started. No. Actually, I'm a stand-up comic. Sure do. Sure. I know the p-perfect place.  Hey, can it, jackass! I don't want her to know I was just here with a different girl. This is authentic Italian food straight from S-Sicily. You should try the Lotsa Mozzarella Pizza Roll. Oh, uh, wow, that is very interesting. Please tell me more. Wow. You know, I've never thought of it that way before, but you're right. If you're pissing blood, you can shove a tampon up your peehole. You are very insightful. Please tell me more. Well of course I wanna get laid. That's why I'm taking you to this ...fancy place and pretending to be interested in what you have to say. What? Fo-for real? Well jumpin' Jesus, what are we wasting our time here for then? The talent show is happening right now! Let's get to r-r-rammin'!  I beg to differ with you, sir. I paid for her and took her out to dinner. She's ''my'' ho! Yes, I do have a problem, as a matter of fact! I've spent all my money on this ho, and she's now my only shot at getting laid, and the talent show is only a couple of hours from being over. Sir, sir, that is ''my'' ho!  Sir, sir! Son of a ...b-bitch!  Sir! I paid for that lady, and by taking her, you are no better than a common th-thief! Nut Gobbler, grab onto my crutch!  I got you, Nut Gobbler!  Come on, ho!  Eugh! Stay on him! I'm not giving up!   How much do I owe you?  C-can I just get two back, please? Thank you.    I'm sorry I resorted to calling you jackass just now, but I'm very upset! What do I have? The weapon of comedy. So apparently the Chinese and the Japanese aren't getting along lately. Have you seen this? Have you heard about this? I'll tell you one thing: their food hasn't been getting along with my stomach for years. Martha Stewart is out of jail. Have you seen this? Have you heard about this? She's apparently gotten real good with baking cakes with keys in them.  Nice teamwork, Nut Gobbler. Not really. You're just a hooker, and I need to get laid. The talent show could be over any minute. Hold everything!  Mrs. Garrison, if you don't mind, I'll be taking that microphone.. Wow, what a terrific audience. So apparently it's been exactly two years since the fall of Baghdad. Have you seen this? Have you heard about this? Just as B-Bush predicted, Baghdad fell, Iraq fell, Saddam fell. The only thing that didn't fall was ...the price of gas.  You've gotta be kidding me. Yeah. Go on, beat it, re... rr-retard!  Yeah, beat it, j... jackass.   The Ch-Chinese will take someone to space for t-t-ten million dollars. Yeah. We told them that, a-and they told us to go f-fruck ourselves. Yeah, uh huh. Boy, you really beat the crap out of that Conifer dad. ...the Beatles in the White Album in Helter Skelter. Okay-  We want to welcome all South Park parents to Fort Collins, and the Little League Division One Playoffs.  And first up for Fort Collins is... Morgan Pratt. That's it. South Park wins the game.  Ooooo! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, all right! I don't think so, South Park Yeah, you think we wanna win? Then we have to keep playing this boring game! I don't think so! There's no way you can lose to us! We're going doowwn! We're gonna get creeaamed! Morgan! You have to swing when it's a ball, otherwise, you're gonna walk to first base. Don't swing, only if it's a strike! You just have to guess. Why the hell did you swing at it?! Yeah! And then we won the stupid regionals and had to do this lousy-ass tournament! We'll just see about that! We wanna play video games. Oh yeah? God!  Yeah! All right! Yeah! Randy! Randy! Randy! Yeah!  Yeah!  Come on, Fort Collins! Let 'em have it! Yeah! Knock it out of the park, Morgan! Cream these turds!  Come on Fort Collins! This team can't pitch!  There you go, Morgan! Run run run! Why don't you shut your mouth before I kick your ass! Sit down before you get hurt!  No way! I'm striking out!  What?  Well how the Sam Hell am I supposed to know if he's gonna be throwing a strike or a ball?! Aw, Jesus!  Aw damnit!  Well I thought he was gonna throw a ball that time!  All right!  Yeah! All right! Yeah! Woohoo! Goddamnit Brian, swing! Bueno bueno! Bueno! Espectacular! ¡Vamonos Pueblo! ¡Viva la Pueblo! You could do it, kids! We know you can win State! The Colorado Little League State Championship is being played this week. Two teams of youngsters get to go head to head at the major-league stadium downtown. A tragic event is unfolding in South Park. Three convicted murderers have escaped from jail and are holding twelve people hostage at the Red Cross! A beloved performing orca whale has been stolen from the Denver Sea Park. A full investigation is underway, but tracking down the kidnappers is proving to be one WHALE of a problem. Thank, Mitch. It seems that this problem is almost un-BEAR-able.  Let's hope that whale is found. Win? Why the hell would we want to win? Yeah. Then we'd have to play this boring game all summer. Oho, well, I'm sure some of the Denver kids' parents would disagree with you and your team- Oho, looks like we got some parental trash talking going on here. Mr. Marsh, any comments? Well, tension is certainly high here, but I guess everything will be decided on the playing field. Tom, the convicts were about to be arrested when they ran inside the Red Cross behind me, and threatened to kill all the workers inside. The violent men are demanding a helicopter and two hundred thousand dollars cash. An incredible development here, Tom. Two little boys have fearlessly gone inside the Red Cross.  Tom, an incredible story of courage. Two little boys, armed only with the weapon of confusion, managed to go in and save the Red Cross. Nobody seems to know who the boys are or where they went off to, but they are heroes.  You ain't got a chance, South Park! Here we go, Denver, here we go! Huh, huh! That's Tom Nelson, one of the Denver players' fathers. He goes to every game in that ridiculous outfit and usually drinks too much and gets into a fight. There ain't no way some little mountain kids can beat Denver. Not with my son on second base! Mr. Marsh? Who wants to hear from a Mr. Marsh?! Iii am the ultimate Little League trash-talking father! Iii am the Bat Dad! Bat Dad knows no fear! Bat Dad knows no pain! I want you, Marsh! I want you!!  All right, Mr. Nelson, let's go, come on. Good luck! You're gonna need it. Yeah, you can't lose to us. We're terrible.  I'm baaack! Hello, cousin Kyle. Oh Jesus, that flight was terrible. They served a chicken dish with hot sauce and it gave me gas. Well, you said you needed my help to win the big game, so here I am. I'll need a wipe cloth if I'm gonna play, though. Sometimes I sweat from holding the bat for so long and then the heat steams up my glasses.  Where do I stand? Don't throw the ball too fast, because I might get startled and I have asthma.  Jesus, not so close! That was three feet from hitting me in the head!  Oh Jesus! Don't throw it so hard or so close next time! Is it cold out here? I think I need a jacket.  Oh Jesus!   I can't, I can't keep running like this! I have corns in my feet! Oh Jesus, did you see that? I hit a homerun! High-five, everybody!  Oh Jesus, we're gonna win! I I never won a sport before; this is so exciting. We... We lost? You know what these guys look like to me? A bunch of winners! You're the best! Not a chance, 'cause we're gonna lose to you right now! Yeah! We're about to get our asses kicked! Here we go, Denver! These South Park kids got nothin' on you! Let's go, Denver! Throw the ball to third, you idiots! He's runnin' home!  All right, Denver! You're up to bat now!  Come on, Denver! Get the lead out! Do not cross the Bat Daaad! Why don't you just go home, South Park? You can't beat Denver! You'd better shut your mouth before I shut it for you!  He's done for anyway.  Chris, will you sit down? What is that kid doing? Who is that lady? Well what about lesbians?! Hello, would you like to take a personality test? It's fun and it's free. We're doing free personality tests today. Have you heard of Scientology? It's all based on the book, ''Dianetics''. A lot of really cool people are Scientologists, like Tom Cruise and John Travolta. Why don't you come on in and we'll get your fun free personality test started.  Hey Brian. The boy is from a small mountain town in Colorado, sir. What? He's not gonna swing! Throw balls! Yeeaahh! Go Tolkien go! Yaaay! Denver sucks ass!  It all comes down to this! South Park is just one pitch away from being State Champions.  Oh geez, it looks like two parents are fighting. They'd better be careful. The Little League has a no-tolerance policy. South Park has been disqualified from the game! Denver wins!  Break it up! Break it up!  That's enough! The next person that fights is getting his team disqualified! All right, come on! Let's play ball! Stop, stop right now!  That's it! That's it! South Park is disqualified! Get up, Randy! Get up, ya bum! Randy! Randy! Randy! Randy! Randy! Randy! Randy! Randy! Randy! Ohhhh. Ohhhh. Yeah, that's right! Aww! Awww! All right, ma'am. We've got your new toilet installed and we'll haul away the old one away for ya. Hunh, I could think of a few ways, hunh. What happened? Did they say? Aww, that's tragic. Apparently there was so much chicken skin in the system it just ruptured the insides. Yeah. You mean destroy it? Me too. You mean like that movie, ''Juwanna Mann''? Yeah, screw him! Yeah. Certainly. Come in.  Have a seat and tell me what it is you seek. Well, many times, the reason that the soul stays Earth-bound is because God is intending to ''use'' that soul for a divine purpose, to help prevent an impending tragic event. But now, you shouldn't think you're crazy, young man. I see ghosts all the time. Yes. When's the last time you saw yours? AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!  Stay calm in there. We don't want anybody getting hurt. What the hell is that kid doing?  You get us a helicopter and two hundred thousand dollars or these people start dyin', man! This is really weird.  Somebody's comin' in! What the hell is going on?  What?!  Son of a bitch. It's just some little fat kid.  I have no idea. The hostages are gone! The hostages are clear! Your son is at the Bowery Building threatening to kill himself. Don't do it son! You have too much to live for!  Hey Jimmy, how was school? Jimmy, we understand you're getting erections in the classroom. Mr. Mackey, your counselor. Now, Jimmy, it's nothing to be ashamed of. But we know it's something you might have a hard time talking about. Get it? A hard time. So, we took your counselor's advice 'nd called Doctor Pal to help us all talk about this. A-all right, come on, honey.   Hey Jimmy, I'm Doctor Pal. That's because I'm a doctor, but I'm also your pal. Are we cool? A lot of times parents call me in because I can relate to younger kids. I'm, I'm down, I'm dope, you dig? Now, I understand you have some concerns about erections.  "Oops, can't say erection in front of the parents right. Oh God, I feel so weird" huh? Jimmy, there's nothing weird about random erections. Almost every boy goes through a phase where his penis becomes hard... for no particular reason. It's just part of growing up. Growing up? Growing out is more like it.  Tell you what, Mom and Dad, why don't you skedaddle for a tick and let us hipsters talk in privo. Jimmy, as you get older your body goes through a lot of changes. Certain hormones start to release as your whole reproductive system begins to awaken, and so, if you like, we can take off our shirts and kiss. Oh, hey, nothin', you see? See, that set you off on a different tangent, got you thinkin' a different way. That's what Doctor Pal is here to do.  Unless, of course, you think we ''should'' take off our shirts and kiss. Well then to hell with you, kid. You can just deal with your problems on your own.  Talk to you, Bertha. Okay, see you later, Jessie. Oh, hey Jimmy. What's goin' on? What?? No way!  Jerk!  Shauna honey, I think your little date is here. Clyde? What is it, honey?   Hi Jimmy. Thanks, Jimmy. Where are we going? You know that girl Sally Rauman at our school? I can't stand her. Really? Well, Kelligan bought the same purse and I was like, "No WAY do I want it now!" because who wants a purse that both their best friends have, right? And so- I guess ''that's'' why I figured, "Who needs friends like THAT?" It's like I told Debbie: "If you're gonna go out with my friends-" "And so if you're gonna be ''that'' way, I don't ''need'' to be your friend." You know, Jimmy, you are a great listener. Yeah. I mean, no other boys really communicate like you do.  I'm not doing that! Creep!  Welcome to Buca de Fagghecini for the authentico experience Italiano. My name is Roma. Can I start you out with some lotsa pasta macaroni minis? Right away.  Colfax Point. Pimps and hos and tricks in rows. Women walk the street with corns on their feets. Broken dreams and no ice creams. You lookin' for a date? They call me Nut Gobbler. Huh?? You a cop? You got money? All right, you got a place to go? What are we doin' anyway? I can't eat too much, I've got an infected urinary tract. I've been pissin' blood for a week. Huh?  Well, that's it, I just piss blood! So I have to stick a tampon up my peehole. Look, kid, what are you doin'?! You wanna get laid or not? Kid, I'm a hooker. You don't have to take me to dinner OR be nice to me. You paid me, so you get to do me. It's that simple. It's where the trick wanted to go, you bastard! Uh Jesus. Agh! Let go of my hair, you son of a bitch! Where are you taking me?! No! Please! Q Money! I'm sorry! Aaaah!  Aah??  ' No! Heelllp!!  Haaaaaaaaaa!! Please, Q Money! Don't do this! Serves you right, you son of a bitch! I can't believe you chased me all this way. You, you really care about me. That's good enough for me.  Welcome to Buca de Fagghecini for the authentic experienso Italiano. My name is Roma, and uhhh  Oh, it's nice to see you again, Mr. Valmer. Oh right, pardone, segnore. I'll come back with some garlic bread mediterraneane.  What are you doin', ho?! Havin' dinner?! You're supposed to be workin' for me! Trick?! I ain't stupid! Ain't no trick gonna take you out to dinner!  This is MY ho! You got a problem, bitch?!  I'm gonna kick your ass, ho!  I'm gonna kill you, ho! <i>Lying beside you, here in the dark. Feeling your heartbeat with mine...</i> You're already dead, ho!  Fuck you, punk!   Get your ass back in here, ho! Goddamn, this pimp just won't give up! You're gonna pay for this, bitch! I told you never to turn on me, ho! And what are you gonna do, huh?! I've got four feet on you AND a gun! What do you have?! What?!  That's pretty good.  No no nono no, I'm not gonna be in the talent show. Oh no nono no. I'll never be in your faggy talent show.  That was killer. We showed them. Yeah, I hope we win. Look out!  Six dollars and twenty-four cents. Oh, thank you very much.  There you go. Have a good 'n. Daww? Tada!  Tom, I'm currently ten miles outside of Beaverton, unable to get inside the town proper. We do not have any reports of fatalities yet, but we believe that the death toll may be in the hundreds of millions. Beaverton has only a population of about eight thousand, Tom, so this would be quite devastating. Tom, I am standing just outside of Chicago, where the panic of global warming has already caused countless deaths. Already we're reporting that the death toll here in Chicago is over 600 billion people Tom, I'm standing outside the Governor's office, where in just two days, the Governor can either sign or veto the new bill allowing gay marriage. Same-sex couples from all over the state have shown up in support,  while dissenters have also converged. The governor is about to give a statement. Thanks, Tom, I'm here at the Denver Sea Park where, believe it or not, dozens of people have come to show ''support'' for whoever took the whale.  One thing for certain: something is certainly FISHY here at the Sea Park. Tom? W-we're not sure what exactly is going on inside the town of Beaverton, uh Tom, but we're reporting that there's looting, raping, and yes, even acts of cannibalism. No, no, we haven't actually seen it Tom, we're just reporting it. George Bush didn't break that beaver dam! It was terrorists and Al Qaeda! They've been secretly building beaver dam WMDs for ''years'' now!  We don't "hate" homosexuals, we, we we just don't want them to be able to marry. Thank you for returning! You can't make fun of Scientology, kid! We are gonna sue your ass AND your balls! My name is Harry and I'm an alcoholic. Excuse me, sir, but, ...when? When is this going to happen?  Excuse me, I'm sure we're all very impressed with your wild theories, Doctor uh, Marsh, but the fact is no statistical proof has ever been confirmed that global warming exists. Are you suggesting we shut down the economy?! Listen! Listen! We've finished running the tests! Global Warming is going to strike... two days be''fore'' the day after tomorrow.  We didn't listen! Yeah. Yeah. I was diagnosed with brain cancer two months ago. I feel like this is my only hope.  Eey, what do you think you're doin', kid?  Oh Jesus, here it comes!  Global warming!  Back o'the line, butter!  It's coming! Here comes global warming! This kid's cutting in line! We didn't listen!  I'm, I'm, I'm powerless too! Get me seven martinis! It's right behind us!  Yeah me too! Hello? Anybody? We'd like to be rescued, please. Any day now. I... I don't know. Hey, we'll take it!  Oh, thanks. Thanks. That's a LOT better. Oh wow, thank you so much! What a swift and speedy rescue! Why haven't they come for us? Really? Oh! It's about time! Wait, look! Here comes a boat! It looks like... three little boys. Oh Kevin, we're saved!  You can't go out there. You'll freeze to death. Jack and Coke! Come on, people, we're running out of time! We need all Army helicopters to the Southern states for evacuation NOW! Tell them that the government can't help them, but that we're very sorry. You know the plan, people! We can only evacuate citizens below this line!  WHAT?? What?? Oh my God. Quick! Radio the helicopters!  Global warming didn't cause the Beaverton flood. We know now whose fault it is.  Crab people! E-excuse me, General? We've just compiled some new information. The er, the flood in Beaverton wasn't caused by global warming after all. We know the truth now. We ''know'' what caused it!  We made it!  ''Crab People, Crab People, Taste like-'' No. Don't you see what this child is saying? We can't spend all our energy placing blame when something bad happens. He's saying... we ''all'' broke the dam. ' I broke the dam. I broke the dam. I broke the dam. I broke the dam. I broke the dam. He did, that kid just cut in line! I broke the dam.  I broke the dam. I broke the dam. I broke the dam. I broke the dam. I broke the dam. I broke the dam. I broke the dam. I broke the dam. I broke the dam. I broke the dam. I broke the dam. I broke the dam. I broke the dam.  Woohoo! You rock, Bebe!  Yeah. Let's go! Okay, okay. My turn, do me now! I want to know if I'm gonna live in a big mansion in the future. Four. Blue.  Red. All right! That girl sure has a strange sense of fashion. We could play "girl talk."  Yeah, and you're flat!  She's in the bathroom crying.  Aw gee, she's really upset. Marjorine, we were just teasing. We think you're great.  Stan, I need you to watch the egg for a while. I've been looking after it all day. I have to go to the hair salon and the candy store! Stan, this is our egg. We're both supposed to take care of it.  Hey Wendy, how's your egg doing? Yeah.  I wish I had a partner like Kyle! I went to go pick up the egg from Stan yesterday, and his dog had it in its mouth! Our egg isn't gonna last a week with Stan around! Oh, goodie.  Okay Bebe. What do you want to know? Okay, let's find out. Ready?  Pick a number. One, two, three, four. Okay, pick a color. B-L-U-E. All right pick another color 'Kaaay. Okay, will Bebe live in a big mansion in the future?  Definitely yes! Whoa! Wow! Do me next. I wanna know if I'm gonna marry somebody cute. Three. Now blue! Aw dangit! Who's Butters? Where do you buy your clothes? I bought the new Justin Timberlake CD. We should dance to it.  I will.  Yeah. I can tell ''your'' future, Marjorine! You're going to live alone your entire life because you're a nerdy, dorky geek. Marjorine, why don't you just leave? Nobody wants you here! He yMarjorine, you wanna know your future? I'll do it! I'll do it!  Pick a number. One, two, three. Now, pick a color. G-R-E-E-N. The answer is no.  'Kay Mom. Who? Mom, I didn't invite her! Her mother? So, what do you guys wanna do first? Marjorine, what is your problem? Yeah, and your hair is totally stupid.   Marjorine. Marjorine? Marjorine? Hey, we didn't mean it. Marjorine, you just have a ''different'' look, that's all. We just... we need to help you bring out your inner beauty. Sure.  Here, you do my future. Well uh you know, it's easy. You just put your thumbs and index fingers in here... There's a boy here?  What the hell? ...Anybody have a piece of notebook paper so I can make another one?  Awww! Our egg is fine. Mr. and Mrs. Stotch? You'd better come quick. No, wait. What... what's he doing?  JESUS CHRIST!  And he shall be remembered as the peaceful little boy who warmed his parent's hearts.  Lord, as we commit this child's body to the earth, may we ask it'd be the last child you strike down so mercilessly. We know this request to be futile, Lord, but just though we would ask. ''[the casket is lowered]' Okay children, let's take our seats. Now I know that we're all still in deep, deep mourning over the tragic death of our classmate, Butters. But we all must try to move on. And so I'd like you to help me welcome a new student who was just moved here from Dallas. Children please say hello to... Marjorine.  Why don't you tell the children a little bit about yourself, Marjorine? Now Marjorine, that's not very ladylike. Us Colorado girls love to get pounded in the snootch just like any woman, but we keep it to ourselves. All right, have a seat, Marjorine. I'm sure all the other girls will be happy to show you around the school.  Won't you, girls?  Heidi, sweetie, I'm just gonna set the snacks over here. Oh, and Heidi, there's going to be one extra girl coming to your slumber party. The new girl in your class, Marjorine. I know, sweetie, but I got a call from Marjorine's mother. She said Marjorine is having a really hard time being in a new school. Her mom asked me personally if we could have Marjorine over, and besides, her mother told me that she works as a state official and that I should  respect her authoratay. Marjorine, sweetie your mom's on the phone. Mr. Stotch. I know what you're thinkin'.  I came to talk you out of it. You need to... just accept that your son is dead, not try to bring him back.  I know you're thinkin' of puttin'; him up there, the Indian Burial Ground up that road. You're thinking if you bury his body there, he will come back alive. Sometimes, dead is better. It's been done before, what you're thinkin' of. The Nelson boy, back in '85. Don't do it Stotch! What comes out of the ground ain't the thing you put in. The Indians knew that. That's why they stopped using it when the ground went sour. I'm just here to talk you out of it.  All right, now we all want you to have a good time. But as Heidi's parents, tonight it is our responsibility to look out for all of you. There's not gonna be any drinking, no pot, and most importantly, if I catch any ''boys'' anywhere near this party, they're gonna be in a world of hurt.  Aha! I knew it! Boys in the slumber party! I know. Let's do "Light as a feather, stiff as a board."  Who wants to do it first? Light as a feather, stiff as a board. I think we went too far with Marjorine. I feel terrible, you guys. It can't be easy being the new girl in school. You're not ugly, Marjorine. Yeah. How about we all give you a little makeover, Marjorine? Oh great. It's a pretty easy project. Kyle's really good with the egg.  No. No, that's my egg. But I ''made'' that egg. Mr. Garrison, please. Youyou can't give my egg to Stan, he'll break it.  I wanna see my egg.  I want to see my egg. Yes it is. I made it, I decorated it. ...I just wanna hold my egg for a couple of minutes. Don't let anything happen to it, please.  Stan, I'm sorry I doubted you. You really made a great dad. Hello, I'm Rachel with Quality Curtains. Which room are we looking at?  Oh my God! Little boy, what are you doing here?  Timmiih! TimmiIH!   Slave, should I leave you two alone?  Yes. Oh that's not true! Colorado is about to pass a bill which allows same-sex marriage. A new study? Yeah, we were just thinkin' o' goin' and askin' the Governor to veto the bill. He's wonderful.  He's wonderful. Yeah.   Oh jeez, I knew this would happen. First the gay people come in here wanting equal rights, then this bill gets passed and now all the people against it want me to ''veto'' it. ''[slams his right fist on his desk]> Why do I have to make this decision?? />'' I just wanted a big house and lots of respect. I didn't want this kind of responsibility.  I mean, I don't know anything about gay marriage. What argument can I use to deny them their right to a family? I can't use that argument. There's never been a study done which proves that either way. Then I would have something to fall back on. So-something to take all the pressure off of me. I believe that I might have come up with a compromise to this whole problem that will make everyone happy! People in the gay community want the same rights as married couples, but dissenters don't want the word "marriage" corrupted. So how about we let gay people get married, but call it something else?  Instead of being "man and wife," you'll be... butt buddies. You won't be "betrothed," you'll be... butt buddies. Get it? Instead of a "bride and groom," you'd be... butt buddies. Y-you are equal. It's just that instead of getting "engaged," you would be... butt buuuddies. And everyone is happy! Well like anyone cares about fuckin' dykes.  Oh, God, I was sure that would work. Today is a very big day in which I'm supposed to make a very big decision. As some of you know, my biggest issue with gay marriage regards child-rearing. And a new study has just been concluded which will give me the ability to take no personal responsibility in this decision. Here with the results of that study is the lovely Mrs. Garrison.   Who the hell are you?! Ahh yes, you are interested in my services. Who do you want me to kill?  What is this? You want me to kill an egg? What do you expect me to do with it? I am a serious assassin! Get out of my face!  I am the greatest killer the world has ever seen!! I will murder that egg! Then I will make it curse the day it was laid! Almost too easy.  I was sure I did!   Uh, Mrs. Garrison. You have an emergency phone call. Sir! Sir, somebody is on telephone! Another rich American wants to fly into space!  I now pronounce you man... and man.  Hello?  Thanks, Mom and Dad.  Ron Howard? What is it? Shut the door!  Mom, Dad, these boys wanna know about us. How come? Yeah! Aaah!  It's a... little ginger girl. Ow! Your dad doesn't drink either? Does that mean we're friends?  What? Heh, hello there, kids.  Oho, gingers, yes. Our cute little red-haired rascals. Yes, we've learned that the ginger gene is recessive in both our families' DNA. Actually, the odds of us having a red-haired freckled child were only one in four. And still it happened. Three times. What are the odds?  Each one of them's a blessing. Huh Blesse-blessing full of love. No... no, I'm sure they do.  Well it was nice meeting you boys. We've gotta get dinner started. Look, boys, if you really don't wanna have ginger kids, marry an Asian woman. Asians don't carry the recessive gene.  A lot of people carry the ginger gene and don't know.  Oh yes, each one of them's a blessing. My dad says that each one of my freckles is a kiss from an angel. Ron Howard?  Okay, welcome, everyone. It's so great to see such a wonderful turnout at the first All-Ginger Pride Conference!  Now it is my honor to introduce the man who has brought self-respect to gingers, Eric Cartman! Yeah! AAAAAH!  Red Power! Red Power! Red Power! Red Power! Yeah! Red Power! Red Power! Red Power! Red Power! Better red than dead! Yeah! That's right!  Red Power! Yeah!! Huzzah! Huzzah! Daywalker!  Throw him in! Yeah! Huh? What? ''[unsure] Ginger or not, it's all the same.'' ''We shouldn't kill each other 'cause we're all the same.'' ''Black or white, brown or red, we shouldn't kill each other, 'cause dying's lame.'' ''Hand in hand, we can live together. We shouldn't kill each other 'cause we're all the same.'' Tom, I'm standing outside the Denver Center For The Performing Arts, where the new production of "Annie" has just premiered to cries of outrage.  who isn't actually red-haired and freckled. Joining me now is the gingers' head spokesperson, Eric Cartman. It's been four hours now, and Tom Cruise still will not come out of the closet. Hundreds of onlookers here have gathered here in hopes that the celebrity will finally give in. We're still not exactly sure why Tom Cruise is ''in'' the closet, but I'm being joined now by famous singer/songwriter R. Kelly. Tom, it now appears that John Travolta is also in the closet, and ''he'' refuses to come out. Here with more details once again, is R. Kelly. Oh geez, here we go with the gun again. Breaking news here in South Park. Tom Cruise and John Travolta still... will not come out of the closet. Park County police have decided to try a new method. We've just had an incredible development here, Mitch. Tom Cruise, John Travolta, and R. Kelly, have all come out of the closet!  Tom, I'm standing in the garden of St. Peter's church in Bailey, where what some call a miracle is taking place. The statue of the Virgin Mary has started to bleed. Out its ass.  People from all over the state have flocked here to the church to witness the apparent miracle firsthand. Why do you believe the Virgin Mary is dripping blood? Why do you believe the Virgin Mary is dripping blood out her ass?  As news of the miracle spreads, hundreds are expected to show up here at the church, hoping to witness the miracle, and even cure their diseases. The crowd grows larger every hour, as the statue of the Virgin Mary continues to miraculously cry blood... out her ass. A Cardinal, Mallory, has been sent by the Vatican to determine whether this is a true miracle or not.  An update from the bleeding Virgin Mary statue! Earlier today, the new pope, Pope Benedict the 16th himself, visited the statue here in Bailey to witness the miracle firsthand.  It was an amazing sight to behold as Pope Benedict made his way through the throngs of people. The pope then examined the statue closely.  After witnessing the phenomenon firsthand, the pope then cleaned himself off and then declared that the bleeding Virgin Mary statue is not a miracle! Having investigated closely, the pope determined that the blood was not coming from the Virgin Mary's ass, but rather, from her vagina. And the pope said quote, "A chick bleeding out her vagina is no miracle. Chicks bleed out their vagina's all the time."  Back to you, Tom. Hello there! Gary Nelson with Hilton Guest Relations. Just making sure you guys have everything you need.  Need any buffet items restocked? Everyone okay on coffee? Great. Oh, and hey guys, just wanted to say thanks for choosing the Airport Hilton for your conference. You guys got everything you need in here? Need more coffee, buffet items? How about lava? You got enough lava? Okay. Hey, thanks for choosin' the Airport Hilton, guys. Huh What Ex-terminate? Laaa la, laaa lala. laaa lala. laaa la. Laaa la, laaa lala, laaa la.  Laaa la, laaa lala. Come on, let's fulfill the plan! All non-gingers must die!  What did that kid in the green hat tell you? That kid right there. What did he just tell you? You wanted to kill everyone who wasn't ginger, then that kid in the green hat told you something, and now you don't wanna do it all of a sudden. What did he tell you? But... you just said everyone who isn't ginger must die. But you just said they should all die fifteen seconds ago. ''Black or white, brown or red, we shouldn't kill each other, 'cause dying's lame.'' <br />  Hey Kelly. How's it going? Hey there! How are you? Good times, good times! Ho, that's not a problem at all. Scientology is more like an alternative to psychology than a religion. Oho, that's just this thing: What's the Denver Broncos' record now? Six and two? Wow! That's great! All right, come on in and take a seat; we're gonna have some fun!  Okay. Number 1: Do you ever make remarks... which you later regret? Uh huh. Would you rather give orders... than take them? Do you ever whistle... just for the fun of it.  Okay, and finally, does life sometimes feel vague and confusing to you? Okay, Stan. Well, that's it. That's the end of the personality test. Well, I hate to tell you this, Stan, but... you are one messed-up kid. Yeah, I'm afraid that you are completely miserable ''and'' totally depressed. Well there's certainly no question that you are a perfect candidate for Scientology. I think it can really make you happy again. It's very simple. We just need two hundred and forty dollars.  Yep- Oh hey there, Greg! Huh, well. We'll get another E-meter - this one's obviously broken. Sorry about this, Greg. Mike, I need to talk to you!  Take a look at this. The E-meter results from the little boy in Room D We ran the tests four times! We used four different E-meters! Oh! We are gonna ''sue'' you! And now, Jambu is going to going to give you all a big wave!  Now get ready for Jambu's next trick.   We hope you enjoyed Jambu's orca show, and enjoy the rest of your day at Denver's Sea Park!  Dude, did you see that episode of ''Trading Spouses'' last night? That was insane. Yeah, well ha- whoa. What the hell?  What happened? We can't tell them, then they're, they're gonna think this is all ''our'' fault How were we supposed to know that they were gonna actually do it?!  we've just gotta make this right ourselves. We've gotta track down those kids. Before the police do! Will you relax? Those kids said they were from South Park. We've just gotta go door to door. Do you have the composite sketch we did? Let's go!   Oh my good, look! We're close. We're really close!  Oh... h-hello ma'am. We're just here to examine your pool. Ma'am, do you recognize any of these boys?  We don't know that!  It WAS funny!! It ''was funny'', Bob! And it will be funny again, I swear to you! If those boys took the whale out of here, we would have seen them on the road! I'm telling you, we're close. It's going to be funny! Eh hello ma'am, uh, the teacher at the school said she recognized this boy to be your son?  Ma'am, we need to talk to your son, please! It's very urgent! Which highway did they take?? All right, out of the truck! You're carrying a stolen whale! Come on out, kid.  Just help us get the whale into our truck and we'll all keep quiet about this. Aw crap. Mike? Mike?? Don't say that, Mike. It was funny. It just wasn't that funny this time.  All the other times were still funny, Mike! They were still funny!! Great! I want you to meet my new friend, Stan. Brian's gonna give you your personality test and then let you know some things about Scientology. Michelle, our friend Stan wants to have auditing. It's the beginning of a whole new life for you, Stan. See ya afterwards. Somebody kidnapped Jambu, took him right out of the park. Huh? Oho good, you're going to be so happy. Great, so do you have the two hundred and forty dollars.  Mr. Hubbard discovered that negative emotions are actually caused by things called "body thetans." Yes! And being the genius that he was, Mr. Hubbard invented a way to get rid of those bad thetans.  This is called an E-meter. It's the main tool of Scientology. You just grab a hold of these handles as I talk you through past experiences in your life. I'll be taking readings here, and we'll be able to determine your thetan levels. Come on in the auditing room and I'll show you how it works.  Just take a few deep breaths, and I'll just get a base reading of your thetan levels.  Huh, that's, that's strange. Somethin-,  something's wrong. Brian, could you come over here a second? Will you... look at his thetan levels? And so we just try to analyze your personality, and if it seems like you need some help, then you can have an audit counseling for a nominal fee. Excuse me, sir, I'll be right back.  Are you all right? You're sweating!  What is it?  Fax these results to the head office in Los Angeles. The President has to see thus right away. Go!   The moon? Dude, dude, the boss is coming! What? How? We have to tell them! We know what those boys look like! It IS all our fault! I shouldn't have laughed. All those times we've messed with those kids' heads, I shouldn't have just sat there and laughed. How? This is so bad, man. How do we even know this is the right town to look in??  Yeah. Maybe you should start with the houses on the left, a-and I'll take the- Whale poo. Have you noticed any whales in your pool at all?  We're too late. They've moved on to another town! If they've moved on, then we have no leads! This is fate, Brian! It's fate! For telling the kids their naked dads were gonna beat them up! For thinking that screwing with kids was funny! Oh my God. Look, kid, we need to tell you a little secret.  Jesus, Oh God!   It... wasn't... funny... I've waited... forty-two years... for this day. Don't you all see what this means? There was only one person who EVER registered OT9 in the history of our church.  Hello young man. I'm the head of Scientology. It is...  a great honor to meet you! We've been looking for your son for a long time, Mr. Marsh. He is the reincarnation of our church's most famous prophet. Scientologists the world over are simply rejoicing at his second coming. We're not asking him to join us, we're asking him... to lead us. Yes, John Travolta and Tom Cruise are big Scientologists. Do you believe me nooow?  Young man, I know you don't remember it,but... your name was L. Ron Hubbard. You revealed the secret that began the whole Church of Scientology. Please, understand, we just want what is best for your son. The reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard must be taken care of. He had many enemies. Yes. But he was also a prophet... who knew the secret truth about the nature of life. We want to reveal to Stan the great secret of life behind our church. The safely-guarded Scientology doctrine. Please, your son deserves to be enlightened. Would you excuse us, please? This is highly classified church information. Usually, to hear the secret doctrine, you have to be in the church for several years, Stan.  Are you ready to hear the truth? You see, Stan, there is a reason for people feeling sad and depressed.  An alien reason. It all began 75 million years ago. Back then there was a galactinc federation of planets which was ruled over by the evil Lord Xenu. Xenu thought his galaxy was overpopulated,  The frozen alien bodies were loaded onto Xenu's galactic cruisers, which looked like DC-8s, except with rocket engines. The cruisers then took the frozen alien bodies to our planet, to Earth, and dumped them into the volcanoes of Hawaii.  The aliens were no longer frozen, they were dead. The ''souls'' of those aliens, however, lived on, and all ''floated up'' towards the sky. But the evil Lord Xenu had prepared for this. Xenu didn't ''want'' their souls to return! And so he built giant soul-catchers in the sky!  is pick up where he left off. Neither did L. Ron when he started. He said he just closed his eyes, and wrote down whatever came to mind. You can do the same. Just let it flow. I know. We've sent Nicole Kidman up there to see if she can help. Yes... Yes, oh this is great, Stan! Yes, of course! So wonderful! Yes, of course!  What?  What are you, stupid?! Then how do we make money from those people?! Wait a minute, whoa, whoa! You don't actually believe this crap, do you?? Dummy! Brainwashed alien souls?? E-meters and thetan levels?? Those people out there buy that crap and I thought YOU were smart enough to see what was really going on! What's better than telling people a stupid story and having them believe you?!  Having them PAY you for it, stupid! Because if those people all think you're the reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard, then they'll all buy your new writings, and you and I together will make three million dollars! That's how the scam works! But this is a scam on a global scale! Do you fucking get me now?!  Then keep writing, L. Ron! Your people are waiting. My fellow Scientologists! Our prophet has finished his new doctrine, and will now read some passages before making it available to you all for a nominal fee.  Huh, what? Yeah, you think you can say our religion is a lie?! We'll sue you, buddy! Ho, now you're puttin' words in MY mouth! You are ''so sued!'' How dare you mock our faith, you little punk?! You'll be hearing from our lawyers tomorrow! You are so sued, kid! We're going to! Oh my God, it's John Travolta!  Praise Christ.  Is this where he lives? Is this where L. Ron Hubbard is? Oh my god!  Oh, this is the greatest day of my life! Don't you understand, L. Ron? It's me! Tom Cruise! Ha-haven't I done well, L. Ron? Haven't you enjoyed my acting? Which film did you like best? ...What?  Go away! Go away, I said! No! I'm never coming out! Just leave me alone! Ah hi Nicole. ...I'm not, I'm not in the closet. I'm not in here, though. I'm not, ...I'm not in the closet. I'm, I'm not, I'm not in here. Oh hey John. L. Ron Hubbard doesn't think I'm a great actor. Oh... Okay, but no tricks. Yeah, see?  So you're NOT the prophet, huh?! You made me look stupid! I'm gonna sue you too! I will! I'll sue you in England! Tom Cruise, this is Park County police! Please come out of the closet.  Nobody's gonna be mad, everything's gonna be all right. Just come out of the closet. All right, people, it's obvious we're dealing with a highly intelligent animal-rights group. Those bastards have done stuff like this before. Harris, run a fingerprint on that note!  Hold your positions!   Get them! ''Well I was just standing here, and Tom Cruise locked himself in the closet'' I asked myself why won't Tom Cruise just come out the closet? Nobody has no answers, and so I pull out my gun!  Tell me why Tom Cruise in the closet or else I am gonna shoot someone! ''I was just standing here. Tom Cruise locked himself in the closet'' Then John Travolta come and now, John Travolta in the closet too. Please Tom Cruise and John Travolta come out the closet! But then I calm myself down, and I pull out my gun!    If Tom Cruise and John Travolta don't come out of the closet I'm gonna cap this bitch! ''Now I've been asked to come up here, get you both out of the closet ''Man, this is some crazy shit. Why won't you both just come out the closet? And they said... ''But everyone wants you out the closet.'' ''Now I'm startin' to get angry, so I pull out my gun!  Now I'm in the closet. Now I'm in the closet too.'' Ho ho ho ho ho ho.  Wa ha ha ha! Wa ha ha ha!  Tom? Tom, It's Nicole. Tom, don't you think this has gone on long enough? It's time for you to come out of the closet. Yes you are, Tom. And you need to just end this and come out.  I'm not gonna think any differently of you. Katie's not gonna think any differently of you. You don't need to be in that closet anymore, Tom. Yes, you are. Then how am I talking to you, Tom?  Tom, you can't hide forever just because the reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard doesn't like your acting. Come out of the closet, Tom. You're not fooling anyone. Tom! Hey Tom, it's John Travolta. Tom, you've gotta come out of the closet. Oh my God. Mm-maybe you took what he said out of context. Okay, 's like, if you don't come out, can I at least come in and talk to you? No tricks.  Hey, it's really nice n here. I feel really safe. Oh my god. ''We're not comin' out the closet, so you can just go away.'' ''That doesn't matter 'cause we're gonna stay.'' Hello, little boy.  Do you like my flippers? I did. This is very exciting! Usually when I talk, nobody can hear me. Where are you from? It sure is nice to have somebody to talk to. Can't we talk more? Please? Let's talk about rocket ships. . You know, someday, I wish that I could go up in space in a rocket ship. I try to be, but my wish is to one day blast off in a big rocket ship! Oh God, it's funny every single time.   Please don't call me stupid. I'm sorry. Sometimes I can't talk. It's because I'm very very sick, you see. Yes, because I'm not used to the earth atmosphere. You see, my name is actually Willzy-x, and I'm from the moon!  The... that's where all orca whales are from. If I don't get back to the moon, I'm going to die. I used to. I wish I could return and dance in the moon castle with my wife and three children again. I can't tell them, because they're evil communists from the Horsehead Nebula. They want to kill all us zypods, so they keep us in these horrible tanks and make us perform. Uh, uh, sorry boys, I can't talk anymore. I'm too sick.  And for those of you just joining us, this is the stingray tank. Stingrays are members of the shark family, but they're extremely peaceful creatures. We invite you to gently touch the top of them as they swim by. How could you not have seen anything?? It's a ''whale'', for Christ's sake! Were you in there for three hours?! A note? Let me see that.  What the hell does that mean? Aha! We've got them! Mary Mother of God!    Stop right now!  Stop! That is my whale! No! Sir! Sir, we've found a note! Comrades, I'm afraid our situation is dire. The economy is stale and I... Very soon, Mother Russia... will no longer be a country. Hello? Hello, this is Russian President. Yes, we certainly do!  What were you looking for? The moon. That is quite large trip, but I'm sure we can do it! It sounds like we're in business! We will just need, say, twenty million dollars? ...What? Goddamnit it is prank call again!  Oh, Jesus, now what are we gonna do?! That's right. We are members of the Animal Liberation Front! Whales do not belong in tanks, they belong in the ocean! We applaud whoever did this noble deed! Set the whales free! Leave those kids alone, you bastards! Animal Liberation Front!  These boys are trying to get that whale home! You're not gonna stop them! Save the whale!   Where are you taking the whale? Of course. Brilliant! Release it in international waters. I'll drive the truck.  Hang on, boys. You got it, kid!  Hurry, boys! We'll take care of them!  Swim, mighty whale! You're free! I'm afraid you're too late! The whale's been set free. Now you see that your ways of captivity and exploiting animals will never prevail.  For it is children, with their innocence and their spirit, who know what is truly best for all the world. Oh my God! Set the whales free!  Can I help you? Oh. No, I don't believe so. But we've been out of town for a couple of days and came back to find the fence broken. Do you think somebody's been using it? The fat one in the middle... kinda looks like Dakota Fanning. Excuse me, gentlemen, I have to get back to the oven.  Space, sí ("Yes"). Fly . Claro. Sígueme. ("Sure. Follow me")  De rocket lunar? ("The space rocket?") Sí ("Yes"). Fly . Sí. Mexico?? What's goin' on here?? Hey... That's the stolen whale! We said down on the ground, kid. Move it!  Put down that weapon, now! I said drop the gun NOW!  Everyone down on the ground. Now! You're not goin' anywhere! You're in a lot of trouble!  That whale belongs to a sea park! Yes! Wow! That's right! Save the whales, motherfucker! Conecte la segunda cadena.  No sé si va a llegar.  Sí ("Yes"). Fly . Sí, bye.  Ichi! Ichi! Ichi! Ichi! Ichi! Karutamane-san! What are you doing?! Eriku-san, you must follow direction! You raku disciprine! Mina-san! You all needu more disciprine!  Later Randy. Hello again everyone, my name is Michael, and, I'm an alcoholic.  Hi, Michael. Hi Bill. Hi Harry. We sure are. That's right. Uh huh. Yeah, all right, woohoo!  Yeah! That's right! Right! Hi Randy. I've been using the 12-step program for about two months now and, and I'm really turning my life around. No more blowing guys on Colfax Avenue for a pint of vodka for THIS cowboy!  Then why are you here?  I've been sober now for five years and I I've learned that drinking ice tea and, and getting more involved with my relationship with God is, is, is way more fun than partying. Once I accepted that I was powerless to control my drinking and my life, I I put it in God's hands and now, these meeting are the most fun thing I do. Alcoholism ''is'' a disease.   Right this way, Your Holiness. Oh, hey Randy. What happened to you?? Mm-my  daughter has elephantitis  You're trying to cut in line! Praise Jesus.  Hey. I smell a butter.
