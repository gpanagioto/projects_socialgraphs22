Hey everybody. Can everyone hear me okay? Thanks for turning out, everyone. You know, we've all been through a lot these past several months. We've shut down and people have lost their businesses, lost their livelihoods. I also own a small business. I sell weed, and I have to say ... I'm actually doing pretty good. Amazing.  I think people are really excited. What do you think? What?  I'm doing positive to try and help. People really need this right now.  We'll see if they like my special.  Hi, you here for the special? Here you go.  Oh, hang on. Sorry, uh, didn't somebody say the pandemic special was a bad idea? Oh, come on, think about it. Do you even know anyone personally who's dying of COVID? Jimbo's a fat alcoholic who'd be in the hospital anyway. All I'm saying is that we let some dirty virus from "China" completely upend our lives and shut us down! Sharon, I went to China, remember? Last season? I went there to sell our weed and ended up hanging out with Disney and Mickey Mouse. You remember all that? I know what China's like. Doesn't surprise me all this shit came from there. HA. Told ya!   A bat in Wuhan? Hello. Oh, Oh hey!  To China! Boy, you sure know how to party, Mick! I think that's a bat. Hey, Mick? Where'd you go?  Oooh!  I gotta go!  Hey, it's Randy Marsh From, from Tegridy Farms? Look, um, do you remember when we fucked that bat in Wuhan? Well, I've only fucked one! I remember. Right after, I got really sick, and this was all back in October. You told me to fuck the bat! Nobody knew anything about COVID when I fucked the bat! I thought I just came back from China with the flu! Look, we can't let scientists find that bat. My wife is crazy. If she finds out I started the pandemic, she's gonna be a total bitch about it.  Uh... m-maybe. Oh yeah. Cool. Thank you. Okay, thanks. Okay. Okay okay, just stop!   Heyheyhey, whoa whoa! W-what are you guys doing?!  No! No. You know what? You guys are horrible! Just, just stop it right now! You guys-  What? What did he say? No bat involved. No bat involved!  Oh yeah! Oh yeah! It wasn't a bat! It wasn't a bat! It wasn't a bat! In your face! In your face! It wasn't a bat! Okaaay, okaaay, Shhhh. Okay! I don't wanna think about that right now, Mickey! Then what? What the fuck is a pangolin?  Ha ha, ha whoa!  Okay, Okay. Oh, so now it was "rape." Yeah I'm a pandemic specialist. I'm making one right now.  Oh, okay. Oh, sorry.  Yeah thanks.  Why did you send that to me? Yeah, I know, but I can't just turn myself in! This is all your fault, Mickey Mouse! You made the deal with the devil when you sold your Mulan shit to China! And then you took me out and sold me on how great China was, and how we should all suck their dick! You made me lose my tegridy and anything special that I had-!  Special. Wait a minute. That's it! The Special. The Pandemic Special! That's how we can get my DNA into people! We can vaccinate them without them even knowing! Just give me a couple of more days before you have me killed. I-I think I know a way out of this. Shhh. Hey Jimbo. It's okay, Jimbo. I think I might have a cure for COVID.  Shhhh, this is gonna be great. It's okay, it's okay. Just breathe. Breeeathe.  It's okay. It's okay, breathe. Huh? Uh, what? What? They're probably in my pants pocket. Why? The hospital? For what? Jimbo's better? Holy shit.  It works. It can help.  Ogh. Ogh-o.  Ogh. Just...  what?! I'm doing something important, Sharon! People need this right now! What thing?  Huh. That's weird. No! Nonono! Don't call the doctor! They're busy. These are u-un- precedented times. W-we have no idea what caused this.  Everyone's talking about the special, Sharon. It's a big deal. He obviously needs it right now.  Nooo! Shit!  I just... gotta take all the Pandemic Special over to Thompson Lake and dump it. Because the Pandemic Special needs to end! A special has to end, Sharon, or else it's not really a "special," is it?!  Nono, okay, okay, okay, hold on! I'm coming!  Maybe we can just drop the special by the lake on the way. He's not dead, Sharon. No!  Oh my God. Oh God no.  They got Applebee's too. [turns to Sharon] Drive me back to the farm, Sharon. I need to get something.  Wait! Everyone just stop! I have something that might change all of this!  This... is what you've all be looking for, right? Well here! Go ahead and do all the tests you want on it. You'll find out... everything you need to know.  How do I even begin to apologize? You guys were right. I think all the marijuana really did go to my head. You said it: a drug is a drug, and... I'm not who I used to be. It's time for me to own up to everything. It's time everyone knew what started this pandemic.  ...You want nothing to do with the Pandemic Special. Uh huh.  I just... think maybe I'm gonna do a few more specials. You got some shit on your face.
