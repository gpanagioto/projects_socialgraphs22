 This is it, Stan. If you strike this kid out, we all get to go home. Aw God, I'm so ''borrred''.  Come on, Stan! Just strike this kid out so we can end the season!  No more boring baseball until next year! Nobody said anything about a post-season. I can't believe it. I can't believe we have to keep on playing. You mean, throw the game? You know how our parents are about this sport. You hate this game too? No, ''we're'' gonna get creamed! Dude, he's not gonna swing! So just throw balls. That way he'll have to walk to first base.  Crud!  What? Dude, what are we gonna do? We can't win this game. I know who. There he is! Now, don't let him know we think he's a loser, or else he won't play.  Dude, thanks for helping us out by joining our team. You guys are so good you'll probably go all the way to win the national title! Aw crap!  Oh my God... their pitcher was able to hit him right on the bat. Jesus Christ! They can bat themselves out!  Our whole summer, dude. We have to play this boring game all summer long. Get up! You have to fight!
