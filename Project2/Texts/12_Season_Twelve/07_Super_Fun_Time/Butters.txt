I understand.   No. No!  Do you see any Indians? Oh, that's cool.  Well come on, Eric, we need to catch up with everyone. Oh no! I'm not sneakin' out! I'll get in trouble! Teacher said I can't let go till we're back on the bus! I'm not lettin' go! No, Eric!  No!  T-Teacherrr! Teacherrr! Well, that's ''your'' problem! Make that two!  We should get back to Pioneer Village, that's what we should do! What are you whoofelin' at?  Whoa!  Th-that's it, Eric. We have to be gettin' back! No! If we don't leave right now, we're gonna miss the bus, and then they'll know we left! We're not telling anybody! I don't wanna get in trouble! And I didn't have a super fun time anyways. Yeah, well, I guess that's kinda true. What?! They called the cops?! Oh my God, the police are looking for us!  We're gonna get it now! You just got me busted forever!  No!  You said they wouldn't notice we were gone. You promised.  No. Huh you made me break one rule, I'm not breaking the other! It's all I have now. Jeez, uh cops are looking for us everywhere. That looks dangerous. Oh gosh in heaven. Whoa! I'm gonna fall!  I am so disappointed in myself. Teacher gave me a res-responsibility, and I was just supposed to look after my partner, and I blew it! Huh...  Let's do it! Yeah, it sure has. Or the witty anecdotes of the townspeople, uh... Been a hoot all right! Huh uh. Our teacher said we have to hold hands the whole time we're here! No!  AAAAH! Teacher, my partner is back on the bus!
