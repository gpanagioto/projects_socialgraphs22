==Fictional character biography==
Lord Chaos is an abstract entity that embodies disarray and confusion and is the opposing force to "brother" entity [[Master Order]]. The pair are rarely seen, but appear to manipulate events to prompt [[Spider-Man]] to solicit the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] to join the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and [[Adam Warlock|Warlock]] in the first war against the Titan [[Thanos]] and defeat him.<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' Annual #2 (1977)</ref> Lord Chaos and Master Order were then seen observing King of the Norse Gods [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]] and master villain [[Dormammu]] play a cosmic game of [[chess]].<ref>''Thor'' Annual #9 (1981)</ref> Lord Chaos and Master Order next conspired with other metaphysical and "omnipotent" beings against the [[Beyonder]].<ref>''Secret Wars II'' #6</ref> Lord Chaos and Master Order were then summoned by the [[Silver Surfer]] to regain control over their servant the [[In-Betweener]].<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3 #17 (Nov. 1988)</ref> They imprisoned the In-Betweener for his transgressions.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3 #18 (Dec. 1988)</ref> Lord Chaos and Master Order also attend the funeral of [[Eon (comics)|Eon]] and speak with cosmic hero [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]].<ref>''Quasar'' #26 (Sept. 1991)</ref>

Lord Chaos and Master Order participated in the congress of metaphysical and abstract beings to determine Thanos' fitness to wield the [[Infinity Gems|Infinity Gauntlet]]. They chose to join Adam Warlock and the other cosmic deities in a bid to stop Thanos.<ref>''Infinity Gauntlet'' #3 (Sept. 1991)</ref> With the other abstract beings, they battled Thanos,<ref>''Infinity Gauntlet'' #4-5 (Oct.-Nov. 1991)</ref> and then battled [[Nebula (comics)|Nebula]] when she obtained the Gauntlet from Thanos.<ref>''Infinity Gauntlet'' #6 (Dec. 1991)</ref> The congress of abstract beings then witnessed Adam Warlock's cosmic trial to determine his worthiness to wield the Infinity Gauntlet.<ref>''Warlock and The Infinity Watch'' #1 (Feb. 1991)</ref> Lord Chaos and Master Order were next seen among a group of abstract beings questioning the Beyonder from the [[Dimension of Manifestations]].<ref>''Quasar'' #38 (Sept. 1992)</ref>

In ''[[Infinity Crusade]]'' it is learned that they must obey the dictates of [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]] and Infinity.{{Issue|date=August 2011}}

During the ''[[Time Runs Out]]'' storyline, the [[Beyonders]] are revealed to have killed Lord Chaos, Master Order, and the In-Betweener as part of destroying abstract entities in each reality across the multiverse.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 3 #30 (April 2015)</ref>

Following the restoration of the universe after the [[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]], Lord Chaos along with [[Master Order]] became disgruntled by Galactus' evolution from a force of destruction to a force of creation.<ref>''The Ultimates'' vol. 2 #6</ref> They eventually put Galactus on trial before the [[Living Tribunal]]. The Tribunal ruled in Galactus' favor and allowed him to remain in his new form, claiming that the universe being in a new iteration meant the cosmic hierarchy wasn't established anew. Master Order and Lord Chaos took this council to heart, and murdered the Tribunal in order to take his place as the personification of multiversal law.<ref>''The Ultimates 2'' vol. 2 #2</ref>

They attempted to turn Galactus back to his world-devourer form. However, for the same reason Order and Chaos could kill the Living Tribunal, they couldn't stop Galactus from fighting back his transformation. If there wasn't a hierarchy yet, it meant Galactus was also on the same level as Order and Chaos, so they couldn't impose their will on him. Because of this, Order and Chaos traveled to their servant, the In-Betweener, and forced him to become the uniting force in a fusion that combined Master Order and Lord Chaos into a single being, the self-proclaimed new order, Logos.<ref>''The Ultimates 2'' vol. 2 #3</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Lord Chaos is an abstract being who embodies the metaphysical concept of Chaos; as such it has no physical form, although on occasion it has manifested as an image of a disembodied bald inhumanly warped and distorted male head.

It has been implied that Lord Chaos, and its counterpart, Master Order, have vast powers which they use to manipulate events within their sphere of influence in subtle ways.{{issue|date=June 2014}} It is known that, through some as yet unknown process, Lord Chaos and Master Order worked together to create the metaphysical being known as the [[In-Betweener]].{{issue|date=June 2014}}

[[Thanos]] wielding the [[Infinity Gems|Infinity Gauntlet]] ranked Lord Chaos' scale of power as above that of [[Galactus]], but below that of [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]].<ref>''Thanos'' Annual #1 (2014)</ref>

However later he and [[Master Order]] were able to easily kill [[Living Tribunal]] by blasting him with energy and also defeat Lifebringer Galactus after transforming into Logos.<ref>''The Ultimates 2'' #2</ref>

==Other versions==
Lord Chaos and Master Order battle Thanos once more in an alternate universe when he possesses the [[Heart of the Universe]].<ref>''Marvel: The End'' #1-6 (2003)</ref>
