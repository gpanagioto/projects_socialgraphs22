What is this? Halt! It will take more than your weak American weapons to destroy me! I have Class 4 armor on, that, uh, ih-ih-- --special armor, that's impenetrable to American bullets. That's fine! I'd like playing with myself! I'll play with myself all day long! What? ''Herr Kommandant'' Cartman has ways of making you talk! What are you guys doing?  A clubhouse? Heheh, that's the lamest thing I've ever heard!  Wwwhy?? That's fine. We'll build our own clubhouse! Fine! And then we'll get girls to play Truth or Dare, too! Fine! Fine! That's fine. Fine! No, Kenny, you can't look, I'm the foreman! Because, Kenny, your family's poor. You have to be the worker. No, Kenny. Mom, it's not a treehouse, it's a clubhouse! Mom? Can we pull up the carpeting in the living room?  But Mmmom, the blueprint says we need carpeting in the clubhouse! Kenny, my mom says you can go get carpeting in the living room now. And stop your bitchin'! So, how's your lame-ass clubhouse, Stan? We'll see about that.  Don't forget you need to cut school early and wait for the hot tub, Kenny. Mr. Garrison, Stan's behavior is having an adverse effect on my education. Look at it, Kenny. It is the greatest clubhouse ever built. Oh, man! And we built it, with our own hands. Now all we need is chicks, Kenny. All right. You go find chicks, Kenny. Because I have to stay here and work! I still have to shingle the roof, test the foundation, run all kinds of inspections. I've got way too much to do, and all you have to do is to go find chicks! Now, stop your bitchin'! Mom, can I watch ''American Gladiators''? What the hell is goin' on in this cartoon? Oh. Hey, Kenny, did you find any chicks to come to the clubhouse?  Holy crap! Behold! The Ewok Village 2000!  How's the clubhouse coming, Stan? Well, I just thought I'd tell you that me and Kenny have finished our clubhouse, and we already have chicks over. It's only a matter of time before we're playin' Truth or Dare with them. Good luck with your piece of crap clubhouse, stupid asshole. Ahaw, that's weak. That's killer. That's totally weak! Sweet. Killer weak, sweet! I had the same thing with my mom the other day. I'm all like, "Ey! I am not a little kid anymore! Ma, I'm eight years old! And if I wanna fingerpaint, then I'm gonna fingerpaint!" Totally. Uuuuuh my mom gives me shit sometimes, and I tell her to shut her hole before I kick her in the nuts!  Okay, we have to play Truth or Dare, quick! Who the hell are you?! How many people? Hey! When are we gonna play Truth or Dare? This is bullcrap! This sucks, Kenny! I wish we'd never built a clubhouse! Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
