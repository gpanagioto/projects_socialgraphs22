 Dude, where is she? We can't wait. Mom!  I want a breast! But Mom, we've been waiting for hours! All right. Okay, this is everything, mom.  Oh, boy!  Cartman, you ate the skin off of EVERY PIECE OF CHICKEN! I can't believe that fat asshole! Well this time he's gone too far! Why do we even hang out with him, anyway? Well it's not like we're nice to him. I mean, we rip on him all the time! All right. Then let's just ignore him. From now on, let's not talk to him, let's not even acknowledge him. I think I have extra. Here you go. Cartman isn't our friend anymore.  Who was that? Dude, he did that to me this morning. Yeah, we know better than to think that. Cartman? Hey Cartman, that was really cool what you did. Well, anyway, we just wanna let you know. Talk to you tomorrow.
