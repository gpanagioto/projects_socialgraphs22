A fully developed character was created by Dennis Cooper and Lee Backman for the 1950s ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]]'' debuting in the third episode of first season "The Case of the Talkative Dummy", and after the solid performance of Robert Shayne, he was adapted to comics. Inspector Henderson for the TV series had a much more important role in Superman crime fighting career, the character was portrayed by [[Robert Shayne]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Scivally |first1=Bruce |title=Superman on Film, Television, Radio and Broadway |date=2008 |publisher=McFarland & Co |isbn=978-0-7864-3166-3 |page=48}}</ref> He is a member of the Metropolis Police Department and is a friend of the Daily Planet staff where he often works in conjunction with them on crime investigations. In the episode "The Talking Clue", Inspector Henderson has a teenage son named Ray (portrayed by Richard Shackleton). The character was only introduced in comics after more than 20 years in Action Comics #440 by [[Elliot S! Maggin]] and [[Curt Swan]] and [[Bob Oksner]].

===Comic history===
It took a while longer for Inspector Henderson to be introduced in the comics.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cronin |first1=Brian |title=The 20-Year Wait for Inspector Henderson to Appear in Superman Comics |url=https://www.cbr.com/superman-comics-inspector-henderson-radio-tv-adaptation/ |website=CBR.com |access-date=30 March 2020}}</ref> When he did, he was once again as Superman's main police contact.<ref>''[[Action Comics]]'' #442. DC Comics.</ref>

He also appeared in issues of the first ''[[Black Lightning]]'' series where it is revealed that he has a son named Andrew who is a member of the [[100 (DC Comics)|100]].<ref name="LightningBolts" />

In ''[[Superboy (comic book)|New Adventures of Superboy]]'' #6 (June 1980), a younger version of the character was introduced. Detective-Sergeant Henderson visited [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]] in an attempt to convince [[Superboy (Kal-El)|Superboy]] to relocate to [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], where the rate and volume of crime was much higher. Henderson was unsuccessful, although the Boy of Steel would relocate to Metropolis upon reaching adulthood and becoming Superman.

Since [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]'s 1986 ''[[The Man of Steel (comics)|Man of Steel]]'' miniseries, Inspector Henderson's role has been reduced somewhat, in favor of newer characters [[Dan Turpin]] and [[Maggie Sawyer]]. Currently, Henderson is Metropolis' [[police commissioner]].

''[[Supergirl (comic book)|Supergirl]]'' (vol. 5) #37 (March 2009) introduces Inspector Mike Henderson, an African-American detective who heads the Metropolis Metacrimes Division, one of two units replacing Sawyer and Turpin's Special Crimes Unit (the other being the [[Science Police]]).

==In other versions==
In ''[[Superman Smashes The Klan]]'', set in 1946, Inspector Henderson is an African-American police detective for the Metropolis Police Force. As such, he must endure the typical racism of the era such as when the Lee family thought he was an intruder on their property after it was subject to a [[Ku Klux Klan]] attack. He himself is directly targeted by the Klan, including being taken prisoner by them along with [[Perry White]] and [[Lois Lane]]. Eventually, Henderson is the one who defeats and arrests a corrupt police officer who is assisting the Klan in a mass terrorist attack on a children's baseball game.
