'''Agent Phillip J. Coulson''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|oʊ|l|s|ən}} {{Respell|KOHL|sən}}) is a [[fiction]]al [[Character (arts)|character]] portrayed and voiced by [[Clark Gregg]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) [[media franchise]]. Coulson is depicted as a high-ranking member of the espionage agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D. (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and longtime partner of [[Nick Fury (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nick Fury]].

After being killed by [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]] and the [[Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Avengers]] form to avenge him, Fury has Coulson resurrected with [[Kree (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Kree]] blood to continue serving S.H.I.E.L.D., putting together a small team of agents supervised by [[Melinda May]] and coming to view one agent, [[Daisy Johnson (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Daisy Johnson]], as a surrogate daughter. After rebuilding S.H.I.E.L.D. following its infiltration and destruction by [[Hydra (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hydra]], saving the planet, and making a deal with a [[demon]] to briefly become '''[[Ghost Rider]]''', stripping him of the blood keeping him alive, Coulson retires to [[Tahiti]] with May, where he dies once again.

Following the destruction of '''Sarge''', a biological duplicate of Coulson created by a monolith and inhabited by the Aztec god [[Pachakutiq (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|Pachakutiq]], a [[Life Model Decoy]] (L.M.D.) of Coulson is made from a copy of his consciousness saved to a [[virtual reality]], and Sarge's and May's genetic memories, resurrecting him again. After preventing an alternate timeline from being conquered by [[Chronicoms]], Coulson decides to travel the world in his [[flying car]], Lola.

Coulson was a central figure in the "[[Infinity Saga]]", appearing in five films, two television series, one digital series, and two [[Marvel One-Shots]], most notably in ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012) and ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' (2013–2020). Several [[#Alternate versions|versions]] of Coulson from within the MCU [[Multiverse (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|multiverse]] also appear, notably in the live-action series ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' and the animated series ''[[What If...? (TV series)|What If...?]]'' (2021), with Gregg reprising the role.

Coulson has additionally appeared in several forms of non-MCU media, being integrated into the [[Marvel Universe|mainstream Marvel Universe]], initially modelled after Gregg and depicted as a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent and supporting character of [[Deadpool]], before being redeveloped as a [[supervillain]] servant of the demon [[Mephisto (Marvel Comics)|Mephisto]] and commander of the [[Squadron Supreme of America]] following his death and resurrection, and the main antagonist of "[[Heroes Reborn (2021 comic)|Heroes Reborn]]".

===''Avengers'' vol. 8===
Phil Coulson later turned up alive and appears as a member of the [[Power Elite]] where he meets with Thunderbolt Ross to talk about the Avengers going global. Coulson states to Ross that he has put together the [[Squadron Supreme#Squadron Supreme of America|Squadron Supreme of America]] to be the sanctioned superheroes of the United States, now expressing an intense hatred for "heroes" such as Captain America and Deadpool.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 8 #10. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Squadron Supreme of America are revealed to be [[simulacrum]]s created by [[Mephisto (Marvel Comics)|Mephisto]] and programmed by the Power Elite so that Phil Coulson can have them be a United States-sponsored superhero team, Coulson having gone to [[Hell]] after his death for unspecified [[war crimes]], and made a deal with Mephisto to be restored to life. During the ''[[War of the Realms]]'' storyline, Coulson summons the Squadron Supreme of America to fight the invading Frost Giants. After the Squadron Supreme of America caused the Frost Giants to retreat, Phil Coulson sends them to Ohio which has become a battleground.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 8 #18. Marvel Comics.</ref>

At [[The Pentagon]], Phil Coulson is briefed about an intruder on Sublevel 7 by a Nick Fury L.M.D. when it turns out to be Black Panther. After noting that the Squadron Supreme herded the Frost Giants into Canada, Black Panther asks Coulson if the Squadron Supreme of America knows that he is a murderer, Coulson quotes "Why don't you ask them yourself?" The Squadron Supreme are summoned to confront Black Panther. Hyperion states that the Squadron Supreme are the United States' sanctioned superhero team in light of the Avengers becoming an anti-American team. As Nighthawk states to Blur that Black Panther will not run as he is under arrest, Black Panther states to them that he does not know how they got their powers and that they are not the Squadron Supreme, as he even asked if they trust Phil Coulson. Before they can grab him, Black Panther contacts [[Broo (comics)|Broo]] to teleport him away. As he disappears, the Black Panther states that Phil Coulson will not answer their questions and that the Avengers are not their enemies unless they force them to be.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 8 #21.

===''Heroes Reborn''===
In "[[Heroes Reborn (2021 comic)|Heroes Reborn]]", Coulson uses the Pandemonium Cube to rewrite reality in Mephisto's name, erasing the Avengers from existence and making himself the [[President of the United States]], watching the fight between Hyperion and Doctor Juggernaut.<ref>''Heroes Reborn'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> After his role in the reality change is discovered, Coulson faces Captain America in hand-to-hand combat, deriding his influence on American politics. After being defeated, and reality restored, Coulson is imprisoned in the Pandemonium Cube by Mephisto as punishment and brought before the Council of Red, a collection of Mephisto's counterparts from 615 other universes.<ref>''Heroes Return'' #1.

==Concept and creation==
{{Quote box|quote=Agent Coulson was one of the guys who wasn't really in the comic books, and he [had] a very kind of small role in ''Iron Man''. And I was just very lucky that they chose to expand that character and chose to put him more into the universe of it.|source=—Gregg on the character's expansion in ''Thor''<ref name="MTVThor" />|width=33%|align=right}}
Agent Phil Coulson was created by [[Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby|Mark Fergus, Hawk Ostby]], [[Art Marcum and Matt Holloway]] for ''Iron Man'', the first feature film in the MCU.<ref name="April2006Variety" /><ref name="FergusOstbyIM" /> Coulson was the first S.H.I.E.L.D. agent introduced in the MCU, and was portrayed by [[Clark Gregg]], who was offered a three-picture deal. Gregg initially balked at this due to the character initially only being known as "Agent" and having few lines, but recognized Marvel's plan for an interconnected universe;<ref name="GreggJan2016" /> the character was ultimately given the surname "Coulson" after [[Danny Coulson]], whose book ''No Heroes: Inside the FBI's Secret Counter-Terror Force'' was used as a dialogue reference for ''Iron Man''.<ref>{{cite news|date=April 2, 2021|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ZZyHfNE7M |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211215/K2ZZyHfNE7M |archive-date=2021-12-15 |url-status=live|title=FBI Hostage Rescue Team founder Danny Coulson Part 1, Ep. 87|author=The Team House|website=[[YouTube]]|access-date=April 2, 2021}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Gregg went on to play the character in ''[[Iron Man 2]]'', ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'', and ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'', the latter film in which he was provided the first name "Phil".<ref name="shorts" />

Throughout the films, Coulson is generally depicted as a supporting character of the protagonists and used to represent S.H.I.E.L.D.'s presence, to the point that Gregg has described Coulson as "''the'' S.H.I.E.L.D. agent". However, for the [[Marvel One-Shot]] short films ''[[Marvel One-Shots#The Consultant (2011)|The Consultant]]'' and ''[[Marvel One-Shots#A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer (2011)|A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer]]'', Coulson is given "a chance to stand in his own spotlight for once". This was a "natural" move for co-producer Brad Winderbaum, who wanted to "paint a picture of S.H.I.E.L.D. pulling the strings and being responsible for some of the events we've seen in the films. What better character to represent this idea than Agent Coulson, the first S.H.I.E.L.D. agent we were introduced to?"<ref name="shorts" />

At the 2012 [[New York Comic Con]], [[Joss Whedon]] and [[Kevin Feige]] announced that Gregg would be starring as Coulson in ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'', despite the character dying in ''The Avengers'', with Whedon saying "He's headlining the S.H.I.E.L.D. show and always was."<ref name="NYCC2012" /> Gregg said of Whedon's explanation for Coulson's resurrection, "I found it so fascinating and so true to the world of the comics and mythology in general as I understand them that I was immediately in."<ref name="GreggScreenRantApr2013" /> Regarding the amount of creative input he has over the character in the series, Gregg said, "I have meetings with [the [[showrunner]]s] once or twice a year and talk about what the big ideas are ... They're really responsive to the fact that I've been involved with this person four, five years longer than them, but ... I have no complaints with what they're doing."<ref name="GreggCBRJan2015" />

''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' costume designer Ann Foley described Coulson as a "company man", wearing suits in "the S.H.I.E.L.D. palette—grey, black and navy with a distinct but subtle pattern." Foley did note "subtle changes" in Coulson's costuming in the series from the films, such as streamlined suits and "more slick" ties, "now that [he] is back after being 'killed' by Loki".<ref name="FoleyTyranny" /> After Coulson's hand is cut off in the second-season finale, which was realized by having a mechanical axe cut through a "faux arm made of tripe wrapped around a chicken thigh", Gregg described it as "heavy ... one of those things where you’re having the practical difficulty your character does. People were handing me stuff, like files, and I couldn’t really open them without using my nose."<ref name="CoulsonArm" /> This practicality issue continued with the prosthetic hand Coulson subsequently has to use, with Gregg saying "the reality informs the thing. It’s really hard to figure out how to use this prosthetic, and that’s what Phil Coulson’s going through ... I’m hoping it evolves at some point."<ref name="TCAParty2015" /> Gregg also noted that in the third season Coulson would be wearing more casual clothes, partly because "he can’t even seem to tie a tie" with his new hand.<ref name="CoulsonCasual" /> The prosthetic hand evolves throughout the season, with a later iteration projecting an energy shield, inspired by [[Captain America's shield#Other shields|a similar one]] used in the comics by [[Captain America]].<ref name="CoulsonShield" /> The energy shield was created by Cosa, one of the series' visual effects vendors.<ref name="CosaVFX" />

There had been considerations for Coulson to return in ''[[Iron Man 3]]'' and ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'',<ref name="CraveOnline" /> but the character was not slated to appear in any more films.<ref name="ComingSoon" /> Whedon asserts, "As far as the fiction of the movies, Coulson is dead",<ref name="WhedonFilmsDead" /> elaborating that "generally [he feels] like the ''S.H.I.E.L.D.'' audience and ''The Avengers'' audiences are not actually the same group, necessarily," and so the films would have to explain Coulson's resurrection again for the film-only audience if he were to be reintroduced.<ref name="WhedonDeadElaboration" /> Gregg reprises the role once again in ''[[Captain Marvel (film)|Captain Marvel]]'' (2019), as the film is set in the 1990s.<ref name="CaptainMarvel" /> Gregg is digitally de-aged by 25 years, along with co-star [[Samuel L. Jackson]], the first time Marvel has done this for an entire film.<ref name="Feige/FilmJul2018" /> In regards to the character's resurrection within the MCU canon, however, ''[[Loki (TV series)|Loki]]'' head writer [[Michael Waldron]] suggested that, as that show's series premiere "[[Glorious Purpose]]" implies, Coulson actually died in ''The Avengers'' and the events of ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' take place in a parallel timeline.<ref name="WaldronSuggestion" />

===Characterization===
Gregg has stated, "I think of Agent Coulson, after all these years, as a guy with a full life. I think every day he's somewhere doing something for S.H.I.E.L.D., and yet I don't always know what that is... There's always a different twist. In this one he gets to show more of his wisecracking wit, and in this one he's a little bit more of a badass."<ref name="shorts" /> Despite Coulson being called "the most recognizable face in the Marvel Comics movie universe", he is depicted as an "[[everyman]]" in a universe full of superheroes—"the glue that binds" the characters together. Gregg explained his portrayal of the character as "just a guy grumbling about his job ... he's tasked with handling these kind of diva superheroes, you know? 'Oh, really, Asgard? Dude, just get in the car.'"<ref name="WNBC" />

{{quote box|width=33%|align=left|quote=By being so front and center in ''Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' in a way that he wasn’t as much in the films ... he’s gotten some power. He’s at the front lines, and what is the cost of that going to be?|source=–Gregg, on how starring in the television series can affect Coulson differently to appearing in the films.<ref name="GreggRebuilding" />}}
On whether the resurrected Coulson would be the same as before he died, Gregg said "I don’t know how you could not change going through what he went through. I think if he hadn’t gone through some kind of change, it wouldn’t be any good. That said, I don’t know if he understands how much he’s changed."<ref name="GreggScreenRantApr2013" /> Later exploring some of those changes, Gregg stated "In some ways, he kinda finds himself not nearly as cold or ruthless as he would like to be, or as he has been. And at the same time, putting together this team, he feels driven by motives inside of himself that he can't quite always make sense of and that feels very new to him."<ref name="GreggHitFixJan2014" />

After Coulson was promoted to Director of S.H.I.E.L.D., Gregg said "He kind of got his dream job that I don’t even think he would have ever dreamed he would be given ... he’s got a little bit more of an idealistic, big hearted side of him [than Nick Fury does], some of which is going to be extinguished by the hard decisions he has to make." Speaking about the evolving nature of Coulson's relationship with his team, Gregg said "There’s a way he can afford an intimacy with all of them when they’re part of a small, elite squad on the Bus. It’s different than what’s possible for him as Director of S.H.I.E.L.D."<ref name="GreggRebuilding" /> Discussing Coulson's character progression through three seasons in relation to him killing Ward on the alien planet, executive producer [[Jeffrey Bell]] said, "First season Coulson would have beat Ward up and then thrown him over his shoulder and brought him back to Earth and locked him away. Season two Coulson would have defeated him and left him there on the other planet to fend for himself," while season three Coulson paused while the portal to Earth was already closing to take the time to kill Ward.<ref name="BellTHRDec2015" />

For the fourth season, Coulson is demoted back to field agent status. Gregg said that the reasoning for this "makes sense given that S.H.I.E.L.D. is coming out of the shadows. There are people that will want their person in charge." He felt that Coulson would actually prefer this, saying, "I always felt like Coulson was happiest in the field. Neither I nor Coulson loved playing and listening while his agents went into dangerous situations. And there are more dramatic possibilities when you have a boss that you have to deal with."<ref name="GreggSep2016" />

===Alternate forms===
====Sarge / Pachakutiq====
Sarge (portrayed by Clark Gregg) is an alien who occupies a clone body of Coulson which was created by the powers of the Di'Allas and sent hundred years into the past on his and Izel's home planet.

Following the deaths of Izel and Sarge, Enoch and the Chronicoms on his side create a Life Model Decoy of Phil Coulson (portrayed by Clark Gregg) with all of Coulson's memories and modified with Chronicom technology.

==Reception==
In his review for ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.''{{'}}s first season, Evan Valentine at Collider named Clark Gregg as one of the high points of the series, noting that the actor was "one positive I consistently point out in each and every episode". Valentine stated that "What made us fall in love with the character from the first ''Iron Man'' to his death in ''The Avengers'' is still alive and kicking. Coulson was able to throw out quips like none other, while also turning on a dime, and expressing serious rage in moments ... Gregg raises the S.H.I.E.L.D. banner high".<ref name="ColliderSeasonReview" /> Reviewing the episode "[[The Writing on the Wall (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|The Writing on the Wall]]", which concluded the majority of Coulson's storyline in the series up to that point, Kevin Fitzpatrick of Screen Crush praised how Coulson had become "unglued" throughout the series, which had "pushed the newly-minted director into some dark places".<ref name="Ep2.7ScreenCrush" /> Eric Goldman, reviewing for [[IGN]], was also positive of the "unhinged version of Coulson",<ref name="Ep2.7IGN" /> as well as the more serious leadership role the character took on for the [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 2)|second season]], with Goldman finding Coulson's decision in "[[Making Friends and Influencing People]]" that [[Blizzard (Marvel Comics)#Television|Donnie Gill]] "either went with them or had to be taken out" to be especially notable.<ref name="Ep2.3IGN" />
