How can I help you? Yeah, you don't wanna run out of candy on Halloween. Sounds like you wanna be prepared.  Oh, I think you get an app on your phone and you can use them all over town. You don't like scooters?  Well, they seem pretty convenient.  Look, I got nothin' left, all right? Those are already accounted for by folks who called in! Those are for me! I've gotta protect my own house! There's nothin' left here. You've gotta go somewhere else!
