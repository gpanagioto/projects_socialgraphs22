I'm sorry, Mr. Jarvis, it's just that... I have to get up at 4 a.m. to deliver your paper and then I go to school all day.  Yeah. Why?  Hey, hey! What are you doing?! Yes! No-dude, I need my bike to do my job!  Hi, my name is Stan Marsh. I was told to come down here and try to- I ''got'' a job, but without my ''bike'' to do my ''paper route'', I can't ''make the money''! See?  Look, I really need my bike. What do I have to learn?! This isn't fair! ...Yeah?  Me? Oh boy. Uh, all right, guys, over here? Come over here.  We've got a lot of work to do and not much time to do it in. My name is Stan and I'm your new coach. Now we just need to kind of organize a little bit and practice our- All right, fine, go ahead. S- hold it a while, okay? When you shoot the puck to another player. All right, all right, shut up! We're gonna practice! You two guys play defense, and you play goalie. Why not?! What, you got asthma or something?  What? Ah, it's okay. Don't cry.  Oh Jesus, can we just practice? NO!   Jesus Christ.  I got a new job. I'm finally gonna be able to pay off all the money I owe. I'm working with the Pee Wee Hockey League. I'm not playing, I'm coaching.  What are you talking about?  I remember going to Shakey's afterwards.   All right, guys. Tonight is our big game against Adams County. We still have all day to practice. Oh Ohhh. ... I don't know. No, I think you oughta.  Oh uh, hey Nelson. Dude, I can come back later. Is this a bad time for you? Wugh, I'm not sure. I would... think that... it's a lot like it was before you were born? Ogh. Goddammit, dude, I don't know. No, what I mean is, nobody really knows, see? But everyone does it. I mean, it's not like everyone else gets to live and only ''you'' have to die. Everyone's gonna die. You feel better now? Okay, great. Look, I, I gotta get to the stadium, but uh... hang in there? All right?  No- dude, I told you I can't do that. Okay.   Coach, can I talk to you for a second?  Look, there's a kid in my team who's got cancer, and, he wants us to win this game really bad, so, could you just... give us kind of a break? All right, guys, listen.  Relax! If we lose we're not gonna be murderers. Let's go, Park! Come on! Get near the puck!  Tie? Well, what does ''that'' mean? Hello? How are you feeling? Uh, hi Doc. How's he doing? Oh boy. But what can I do? Well, ah, I mean... Yeah... yeah, we'll beat 'em. Well, sure we can. Look, guys. I believe in you. Nelson believes in you. Doesn't that count for anything? They're not gonna kill us.  Haven't you guys ever seen these movies? We're just supposed to rally together, believe in ourselves, and we win in the end. Hey that's right. We need a ringer.  It's just for one game. He won't get hurt, I promise.  Dad, I'm working on my game plan right now.  All right, let's go win! Huh? S-so then we win? Hey. Hey, you can't do this.  We've, we've been through all this stupid emotional crap! But it isn't supposed to end like this!  Play the Red Wings? Jesus Christ!  Stop! Stop this! Hey, can they do that??
