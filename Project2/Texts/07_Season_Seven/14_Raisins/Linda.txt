What are you spending all that money on, Butters? You... have a girlfriend, Butters? Oh, that is so cute. When do we get to meet her?  All right, you win. Stephen, what is this place?  This place is horrible. To objectify girls like this. Little girl, you shouldn't be working here. No, I mean you shouldn't work somewhere where you're paid for how you look. You should be learning a skill so you can grow up to be a businesswoman or even a doctor. Who knows? You could cure cancer. ... Oh. Never mind, I think Raisins might be the perfect place for you. Butters, these girls pretend to be interested in you because they know you'll give them tips.
