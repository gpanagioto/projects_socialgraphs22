 Whoa! Nobody move! What's happening? Oh, they've got me!  Mayor, I didn't know if there was a gunman, or a bomb- I'm sorry. No, Mayor, please. This is all I know. I used to be the only policeman in this town, remember? Bob, ah I used to chase away the sixth graders for you.  No, please, not my sunglasses. Where should I go? Hi, sweetheart. I've uh... I've been let go from the force. I'm so sorry. It might be a little tough to afford your medication, but I'll find a way. You know me. I like to help. I like to be needed.  Uh, who? What do you want? I'm no good as a policeman. I'm a bumbling old fool. They need me? To do what? No! Shoot kids? I don't wanna shoot kids! No. No. Are any of them minorities? Noo no no no no no no no no! Oh Jesus. ISIS, oh God.   Oh ho ho.  I understand you feeling angry at this town. I'm getting pretty angry too. But we can't give up on it. Please boys, don't make it end violently. Aaahaahaaawe! Everybody told me they were terrorists. But, you said you needed me to kill some kids. Yes? You do? Yeah, a lot of changes. What?
