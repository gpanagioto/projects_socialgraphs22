Okay, parents. I know a lot of you want a chance to speak, but we have to talk one at a time. School policy has been to teach sexual education later. In the fifth grade. Teachers, I have some bad news. Last night I received a phone call from the local pharmacist. Apparently, almost all of our fourth graders are sexually active. And now that we've scared them a little they're buying condoms to use. But how old do you think a student should be when they learn about proper condom use? I guess we have no choice. Then it's decided: no more condom classes in grade school.
