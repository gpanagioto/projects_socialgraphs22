You've been shut up in your room for days, Butters. You need to go outside, go play. Why not? What on earth is the matter with him? I just can't stand to hear him scream like that. I'm gonna go upstairs.  Thanks so much for coming to visit Butters in the hospital, boys. It means a lot to him.  What's that? If only we had let him in!
