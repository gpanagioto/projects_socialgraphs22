Ey! Don't call me fat, Tolkien! Yeah! Why don't you chicks go wash some dishes or get pregnant or something?! We'd kick your girlie ass in sledding! Tolkien, I swear to God, if you call me fat one more time  There!   Heh. Huh. Uh-oh.  I'm sorry, Mom.  I'm sorry, Tolkien. Oh, I sure do, Mr. Mackey. I mean, I feel really bad, uhh. What was I thinking?  See ya later. No way! ...What the hell is a hate crime? What? A federal offense? Oh no?? Uh, yes? He's a black kid that goes to my school? He is black. I did? No! I hate hippies! I hate hippies! I mean, the way they always talk about "protectin' the earth" and then drive around in cars that get poor gas mileage and wear those stupid bracelets - I hate 'em! I wanna kick 'em in the nuts!  Ey! Don't call me fat, asshole! No!  Kenny! Kenny, you have to get me out of town! They're gonna put me in jail for a hate crime! You have to take me to Mexico!  Calm down, Kenny! Do you still have that battery-powered toy truck you got last Christmas?! Well, come on! I don't have much time!  Damnit, Kenny! Can't this thing go any faster?! Huh-who's Romper Stomper? Uh... 'Cause I'm just like ''you'' guys. Uh-I'm one of you. Oh, uh, well, personally, I... uhuhuhuh, I... don't like ''Animaniacs''?  So we're friends now? Yeah, neither do I. Friends suck. Hey you guys. Well, it sucks balls. Whattaya think? A what? Wwhat's that? I'd love to eat a cake, you guys, but they don't let us take anything back to the cells from here  Look, that's not important right now! Did you guys bring the cigarettes? Just hand over the God-damned cigarettes! Look, if you guys want me back to win the sledding race,  then I need those cigarettes. Just pass them through these little drill holes here. That's what everybody does. I know. That's why I have to have them up my ass.  Shut up, you guys! It's not funny! Well, okay... here... l'see... Okay, guys, eh... If you'll excuse me, I must be going now.   Yes. They are safely concealed in the depths of my ass. Engh. Egh. Uuuh, stupid cigarettes.  Well, you spend eight years takin' a crap and then flushin' the toilet; it sorta becomes a reflex! Please, just help me bust out of here. Son of a bitch!  Here you go, God-damnit! Well, what the hell do you expect, huh?! Now I got your stupid game; tell me how to break out of here! But you said- I thought that- I want my Mo-omm  Mommy, I want my Mommy!  You will?  What's the matter? Uhokay.  Oh. Really? Yeah. I never really realized that until just now. Okay.  Oh. I can't take these.  Romper? You... well... I know you don't think you've... ever been anybody's friend, but, well, you're a friend to me. You'll never take us alive! We're going down together, pigs!   That's right! I'm back!  What the hell's wrong with Clyde? I hope I can adjust to life outside of the big house. Been on the inside for so long, I don't remember how to live on the outside. When a man is stripped of his freedom, degraded in the ways that I was, it's- Hey.  Yeah, and I'm not gonna take my ''friends'' for granted ever again. Do British people count as an ethnicity for hate crimes? Sweet. Hey, Romper Stomper. Well, that's not all. I snuck something in for you, too. You know how you told me you always wanted to see Disneyland?  Yeah! That's the Pirates of the Caribbean. Ugh. Hegh. Oh! Here comes Space Mountain-oh-uugh.  Ogh! Wait-
