Alright, Airsofters, let's listen up. Before we let you onto the field, we need to run through our safety precautions. First, your Airsoft guns must all have a red tip – Second, there is no full auto allowed on the field. Third, there is a 500 fps limit for your BBs. If you're hit by a BB, raise your hand, say "hit", and go back to respawn. Alright, you guys are Team Rogue Wolf.  You guys will be playing against– where is Team Floppy Weiner? Alright, fine! Then we'll split the kids up on two teams and each one will have a teenager partner. Kid with the poof ball, that's your teenager– Green hat kid, that's your teenager– Team B, those are your two teenagers. Hey, hey, hey! No shooting from less than 10 feet!
