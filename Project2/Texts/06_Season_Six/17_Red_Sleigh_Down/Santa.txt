 Ho ho hoo! Merry Christmas!  Mr. Hankey, how are you? I was just starting to look over the new naughty and nice list the gnomes prepared for me. Oh no, they keep it open until midnight of Christmas Eve. Some kids actually try to cram in a lot of niceness right at the end. You know you're right. Santa hasn't been to that of the world in a looong time. Perhaps Santa could bring peace to this whole situation. Gnomes!  Load up the sleigh with toys! Santa's going to make a special run! And you boys can all watch me from our flight control room. Ho ho hoo! Merry Christmas, everyone!  Ho ho hoo! A Merry Christmas to all! Merry Christmas!  Hold on!   North Pole. This is Santa.  Where are you taking me??   To bring happiness and joy to the children. No, your country has just lost all its Christmas spirit.  What's going on here?! I don't know, I live in the North Pole.  What are you doing?? Oh no. Not Santa's balls!   I'm gonna fucking kill you! Then we're in for a long night, because I don't know shit!  Jesus Christ!  Oh! Thank! Thank God for you, Jesus!  Santa's legs are broken.  I just couldn't do it.   No... don't worry, Jesus, it's nothing. It's just a scratch. We sure did, Jesus.  I'm here, Jesus.  Get to the sleigh! Get to the sleigh!  You're right, kid.  I came to bring Christmas to Iraq and by God I'm gonna do it!  Hohoho! Merry Christmas!  Merry Christmas! Hohoho! Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night! Hohohohoho!   Christmas is a very special time of year, but... this year it almost didn't happen. There's a man named Jesus who gave his life to save me. And so I declare that every year on Christmas Day, we should remember Jesus for what he did, and thank him for it. From now on, Christmas will be a day for remembering a brave man named Jesus. Now, if you'll all excuse me, I've got a lot of work to do.
