 Hello, Ted. Well, first of all, both George and I are very firmly against the murdering of toddlers. And as for altering our films, all we're doing is trying to reach a... new audience with our movies. As the makers of dreams, we like to speak ...for the children. You little brat-! Ah, I mean, you darling children don't know what you're talking about. Changing E.T. was the best thing I ever did.  Wait a minute. What'd you say? Yes. Change ''Raiders of the Lost Ark''! Why didn't we think of it before?! Give me that print, George! We need to make the alterations! You haven't let these doe-eyed children affect your judgment, have you, George?!  Don't forget: you belong to me.  You troublemakers shall be my guests of honor at the premiere of the NEW ''Raiders of the Lost Ark''! Your gay little club is over! Leave him!! Let him run back to his mommy!   The kid? The tweaked out kid?! Your pesistence surprises even me.     This is the birth of the NEW version of ''Raiders of the Lost Ark''! We shall screen it here, and then destroy all the old prints in celebration! Begin the film!  It's beyooootiful.
