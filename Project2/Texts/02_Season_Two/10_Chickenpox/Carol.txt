 That's the whole point, remember? Their moms ''want'' them to catch it while they're young. Nothin'. Uhco-uh, come on in, I was jus' makin' dinner.  Kenny, your little friends are here! Come play with them! I know you're sick! Now get your buns out here!  Throw your sleeping bags in Kenny's room and then come grab some dinner. Let's say grace. Okay, let's dig in. Stuart, don't even get started! That ain't why, Stuart!  It's because ''you'' are an alcoholic retard and ''he'' had dreams of not eating frozen waffles for dinner every night! What am I supposed to do with frozen waffles, clamhead?! You put 'em in the toaster and you cook 'em! Now Kevin, we ain't got enough for everybody. You have to split that with your brother. Kenny, honey, if you're going to sneeze, sneeze on them. You want some more hot water? Naw, we don't go for that hoity-toity ''rich'' folk stuff. Yehah, well, unfortunately my husband is a washed-up hunk of shit! Oh they wuz best friends; you couldn't separate 'em. Oh they jus' grew apart, I guess. I think Stuart's a little jealous that your husband got out of makin' pizzas and went on to make somethin' of hisself. Oh, ''hell'' no! He's a nugget o' deer turd. Uh-I don't know.
