Thank you for coming, everyone.  Boys, please take a seat. Boys, the reason we called you all in is because one of your friends... has a serious illness. Eric Cartman has been diagnosed with HIV. All right, we're going to bring Eric in now, and let's all be as supportive as we can and show him lots of love, okay? All right, boys, now what is this fighting all about? What? Is that true, Eric? Did you give Kyle AIDS?  Did you infect Kyle with the HIV virus, yes or no?! That's right. I think you owe Kyle an apology. You're sorry for what, Eric? That's better. And now Kyle, maybe you should also admit you were wrong for tattling.
