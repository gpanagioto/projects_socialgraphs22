Pretty neat birthday, huh Stan?  MEMEME. I wanna kiss it! I wanna kiss it!  Sorry your birthday got a little ruined by the Japanese. Well Stan, the Japanese just... don't really like dolphins very much. Certainly not as much as us normal people do. But hey, at least you still got your T-shirt!   Great job, son. Now the Japanese are normal, like us.}}
