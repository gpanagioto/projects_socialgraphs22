Cartman's basement/The Coon's headquarters, day. A tapestry there now says "COON aND FRiEndS." The camera pans down to show The Coon with seven new superhero friends

Coon

My fellow heroes, tonight I stopped three murders from happening. [begins pacing back and forth] I don't know why, but we're seeing a huge trend in crime. We have to find out the source of this evil. Something big is about to happen, and it is up to Coon and Friends to stop it. [Stan raises his hand] Yes, Toolshed.

Toolshed

Why do we have to be called "Coon and Friends"?

Coon

[stops] ...What?

Toolshed

We all fight crime together. How come we're just your "friends"?

TupperWear

[steps forward] Yeah. We wanna be called "The Extreme Avenger League."

All

Yeah! That's right. Extreme Avenger League!

Coon

I told you, TupperWear, Extreme Avenger League doesn't work.

TupperWear

Why not?

Coon

It's confusing! The Coon is a brand people already know.

Mosquito

Why can't it be Mosquito and Friends?

Coon

Nobody's fucking heard of you, Mosquito!

Mosquito

Have, so.

Coon

[paces again] Look guys, we need to find out what's causing the crime wave in this city. [stops] Mysterion, you and the Human Kite get on the computer and dig up what you can. TupperWear and Mosquito, scan the news. Toolshed, you run a perimeter check with Iron Maiden.

Iron Maiden

Timmeh!

Coon

Let's work, people! [the other heroes begin to leave, but Coon holds one back] Uh, Mint-Berry Crunch, could I have a quick word with you in the debriefing chamber? [takes Mint-Berry Crunch to a corner of headquarters, sits behind a desk and sighs] Okay, ummm, I really enjoy having you be a part of Coon and Friends and I certainly appreciate your on-time paying of dues and fees; it's just... I don't... I'm not getting your deal. I mean, exactly what is Mint-Berry Crunch supposed to mean? [Mint-Berry Crunch's jaw drops] I, I get that you're half man and half berry, and that you're... crunchy with some mint, but... to be a part of Coon and Friends, you have to have a clear and more... superhero kind of identity. [Mint-Berry Crunch just looks at himself, then back at Coon] Mint-Berry Crunch, ummm, I'm just wondering if... maybe you need to add something else to the Mint-Berry Crunch part of your costume.

Mint-Berry Crunch

[looks at himself again] Like milk?

Coon

[annoyed] No, not like milk! You see, I really think we're on different pages here, Mint-Berry Crunch! It's like you don't even- [an alarm sounds]

Alarm

Coon and Friends alert. Coon and Friends alert.

Coon

Uh oh! [quickly leaves his chair. The superheroes meet up again in front of a big monitor, which is receiving video in Coon-O-Vision.] What's the alert, Mosquito?

Mosquito

There's like a big fire or something in town.

Coon

What? A fire? Coon volume up! [grabs the remote and clicks the up arrow for volume]

News 4 Reporter

There's thought to be at least twenty people trapped inside the apartment building, and firefighters are having no luck.

Coon

My God, this is what we've been waiting for! Coon and Friends, let's head out!

Coon's Friends

Let's do it! Yeah! Let's go! [they begin to head out, but Cartman stops Mint-Berry Crunch again]

Coon

Yeah, uhh, Mint-Berry Crunch, why don't you stay here and mind the place, okay? Kewl. [Mint-Berry Crunch stays behind as the others leave]

+++++


Cartman's house, moments later. The boys come out of the basement

Coon

We've got to get downtown fast, Coon Friends! [walks up to Liane, who's sitting on the sofa reading a book, and stops] Mom, you've gotta drive us downtown!

Liane

Ohh, it's a little late, sweetie. Why don't you boys just keep playing downstairs?

Coon

Mom, you're the Coon's faithful butler! I wanna go downtown now!

Liane

Well, all right. [puts down her book and blanket] I guess I can get some groceries anyway. [rises and leads the boys out to the car]

+++++


Liane's car

Coon

Into the Coon Mobile, everyone! Let's just hope we get there in time! [everyone gets in]

Liane

All right, are you little munchkins buckled up for safety?

Coon

Mom, don't talk to us like that! We're fucking superheroes!

Liane

[bangs the center armrest with her right fist] Eric, what have we talked about with that language?! One more time and I'm not taking you anywhere!

Coon

[exasperated] Oh... I'm sorry Mom, can we go please? [Liane starts the car, and under his breath Coon says] Unbelievable! [crosses his arms]

+++++


Downtown. Fire trucks are everywhere and a few hoses fight the fire. Police are also present

Fireman

We tried gettin' in through the back; it was no good!

Fire Captain

Those people are gonna die if we don't do something!

Liane

[pulls up] Oh my goodness, it's a fire. [the boys leave the car]

Coon

Come on, Coon Friends!

Liane

No- Eric, stay in the car, sweetie!

Fire Captain

Can we try a helicopter?

Fireman

The winds are too high. The chopper would burn in minutes. [Coon and Friends walk up next to the firemen]

Coon

All right, what seems to be the problem?

Fire Captain

Get back, kids. It isn't safe.

Liane

[walks around looking for Cartman] Eric, poopsie?

Coon

Whatever's happening, you need help from the Coon!

Mosquito

And friends!

Fire Captain

Keep those children back, Thompson! [Liane finds the boys and walks up to them]

Coon

Please sir, you must let us-

Liane

Sweetie, let the nice firemen do their job.

Coon

Shut! Up! Mom! God!

Officer

Wait. Look! Up in the sky!

Fireman

It's him! My God, it's really him!

Fire Captain

He's come to help us. Captain Hindsight! [in the distance a superhero flies towards the town. He's wearing red and yellow tights and a black cope with a blue eye on it - looking behind]

Stan

Who's Captain Hindsight?

Announcer

Captain Hindsight, the hero of the modern age. [a series of comic book pictures follows] Once known as Jack Brolin, a reporter for the national news, the hero was born when a freak accident gave him the amazing power of extraordinary hindsight. From toxic spills to unjust wars there is no task too large for... Captain Hindsight! [the hero descends and lands next to the firemen]

Fire Captain

Captain Hindsight, thank God you've come!

Captain Hindsight

What's the skinny?

Fireman

There's people trapped in that burning building, Captain Hindsight. And the fire is so massive we can't get to them.

Captain Hindsight

Hmmm... You see those windows on the right side? They should have built fire escapes on those windows for the higher floors, then people could have gotten down. And then on the roof: they should have built it with a more reinforce structure, so a helicopter could have landed on it.

Fireman

Yes, of course.

Captain Hindsight

And then you see that building to the left?

Fire Captain

Yes.

Captain Hindsight

They shouldn't have built that there. Because now you can't park any fire trucks where you really need to. [stands up tall] Well, looks like my job here is done. Goodbye everyone! [takes off]

Fireman

Thank you, Captain Hindsight!

Officer

Thank youuu!

Fire Captain

All right everyone, I guess that's it. Let's pack it up. [the firemen and officers quickly pack up and leave, but the building keeps burning. Coon and Friends can only watch helplessly as trapped residents scream.]

+++++


The Marsh house, dinner time. The family is eating quietly

Randy

Whoa, boy, did you hear about that fire downtown, Sharon?

Sharon

Oh my gosh, yes! They said like 14 people died.

Randy

It's just ridiculous to me that they didn't build fire escapes on those upper floors! Ridiculous!

Sharon

Oh I know, and if you ask me, they should've built a roof with enough support to land a helicopter.

Randy

I mean, hello!

Stan

Hey you guys are just repeating what that hindsight guy said.

Randy

Why yes, Stan. Captain Hindsight is our protector and guardian. We're just thankful he was there for that fire. And now we can all eat in peace. [an alarm sounds]

Alarm

Coon and Friends alert. Coon and Friends alert. [they look around for the source of the alarm, then get up and enter the living room]

Randy

What the hell is that? [they stop in front of the alarm] Who put that there?

Alarm: Alert

Seriously. All Coon Friends to base. Alert, you guys. I'm seriously.

Stan

[backs up towards the stairs] Mom, Dad? I I finished dinner. Can I go up to my room?

Sharon

[distracted] Well sure, Stan. [Stan goes upstairs] Wha- How did that thing get there, Randy?

Randy

I don't know.

Sharon

Well take it down. It's noisy.

Randy

I can't. I don't know what happened to all my tools. [the alarm stays on as they look at each other in wonder.]

+++++


The Coon's headquarters, day. Toolshed enters the basement, revving his drill

Coon

Alright, Toolshed is here. We can start.

Toolshed

Dude, who said you could put a big siren in my parents' house?

Mosquito

Yeah, I almost got in trouble for it.

Coon

The Coon must be able to signal his friends when a huge catastrophe breaks out.

TupperWear

So what's the huge catastrophe?

Coon

What's the huge-? Did you guys not see that Captain Hindsight guy?!

The Human Kite

Yeah, so?

Coon

So there's a big superhero out there doing stuff on his own and he's NOT part of Coon and Friends!

Toolshed

Oh Jesus...

Coon

[walks up to a hidden computer, which is actually a prop] I've looked into it and this Captain Hindsight is everywhere. He's like some freelance butthole scab. We need to make him join us!

Professor Chaos

Hey fellas? [the boys turn to see him] Fellas, could you let me out please? It uh it's been like six days. [he's in the Coon's holding cell, with a light outside by which he could see.]

Coon

You aren't going anywhere, Chaos!

Professor Chaos

Yeah, but uh, but uh youuu, but you only gave me this bucket to poop in and it's full now. [pulls the bucket into view] And I ain't got nothin' to eat.

Coon

You've got poop, don'tcha? [goes back to the other boys] Now the question is, how are we gonna get Captain Hindsight to join Coon and Friends?

Mysterion

Who cares if a hero doesn't want to be part of Coon and Friends?

Coon

I CARE!

Mysterion

Look, all we need to do is wait for the next disaster, then try to beat Hindsight to the scene.

Coon

There's not gonna be any worse disaster. What could possibly be worse than a fire that kills fourteen people?!

+++++


Marine Sanctuary, day. A pelican rests on a sign at the end of a string of buoys. It takes off as a huge freighter floats by and breaks the string in two. It's a BP Oil ship

BP Man 1

All right, this looks like a jolly good place.

BP Man 2

Yes. Let's let her rip. [a crane operator pulls some levers, releasing a cable which enable a giant drill to descend into the water. The drill hits the sea bottom and all the marine animals there scatter.]

BP Man 3

That's it, lads. Collect that oil! [the drill hits some rock and shakes from the impact]

BP Man 4

Uh oh! [oil begins to ooze out of the hole into the ocean. It quickly reaches the surface and lots of dead fish pop up immediately] Oh deah.

BP Man 3

Oh, don't tell me we did it again?

+++++


The McCormick house, night. Stuart and his wife are in bed asleep; their bedroom window is open. An alarm goes off and they jump out of bed, frightened

Alarm

Coon and Friends alert. Coon and Friends alert. [they exit the room and see the alarm in the hallway] All Coon Friends report to base. I'm so seriously. Emergency. Coon and Friends alert. [Kenny appears and is ready to go. He turns away and is carrying a small back pack over his right shoulder. He goes to a far window and climbs out]

+++++


The Coon's headquarters. The Human Kite, Mysterion, Mint-Berry Crunch, and Mosquito enter it and come down the stairs

Coon

Good, you're all here. Take a look at this. Coon volume up! [raises the volume. On screen is the BP oil spill]

+++++


The Gulf, in Coon-O-Vision

Reporter

It's a scene of utter despair and catastrophe. Oil from the ocean is spill out out of control, and the rescue effort seems futile.

Man

It's horrible. We can't stop the oil from contaminatin' everything.

Woman

Our home is covered in sludge. Where are we supposed to go?

Cajun Shrimp Merchant

Git a lookie on mah scrimp heuh! Might as give ya the best scrimp this side of Louisiana and now down tuh where we all got up in our scrimp, and it ain't worth a slimy noob it ain't sold on. There, now lookit all the url on mah scrimp!

+++++


Coon Headquarters

Mysterion

My God! Another oil spill could mean absolute devastation for the Gulf!

The Human Kite

We've got to help those people!

Coon

Yes. This is definitely a job for Coon and Friends.

Mint-Berry Crunch

Let's pack the Gulf full of flavor! [Cartman looks at him in disbelief]

+++++


The Gulf. As rescuers clean up as best they can, one of them looks up in the sky

Rescuer 1

[a woman] Wait a minute. Look! It's Captain Hindsight! [Captain Hindsight flies towards the rescuers and they begin cheering]

Coon

Oh no!

Captain Hindsight

What seems to be the problem?

Rescuer 2

It's that BP Oil rig, Captain Hindsight. It drilled into a marine sanctuary and the environment is being poisoned.

Rescuer 3

If we can't stop it, the spill could reach New Orleans.

Captain Hindsight

[thinks] Hmm... All right. You see where that rig is drilling?

Rescuer 3

Yes.

Captain Hindsight

It's in too deep of water. They shouldn't have drilled in that deep of water, because now they can't get machines deep enough to fix the spill!

Rescuer 2

Aha!

Rescuer 4

Yesss, YESSS.

Captain Hindsight

Now, if it's a valve that ruptured, then what they should have done is installed the backup valve in case that valve broke.

Rescuer 2

I believe they did install a backup safety valve, Captain Hindsight.

Captain Hindsight

[thinks] Hmmm... Right. Then they should have had a backup safety valve to that backup safety valve!

Rescuer 5

My God, he's right!

Captain Hindsight

My work here is done! I'm off to fine others in need!

Rescuer 4

God bless you, Captain Hindsight! God bless you!!

+++++


Coon Headquarters

Coon

Goddammit! We have got to get that guy into Coon and Friends!

+++++


Jack Brolin's mansion, day. Cartman, dressed in a business suit, rings the bell by the front door

Butler

[answering the door] Can I help you?

Cartman

I understand this is where Captain Hindsight lives?

Butler

Yes?

Cartman

I need to speak with him, please.

Butler

The captain is very busy dealing with the Gulf oil crisis.

Cartman

I believe I have something that can help him deal with that oil crisis, sir.

Butler

Mr. Hindsight, sir. [Hindsight sits behind his desk looking at three monitors with 12 screens each. He turns around at the mention of his name] This young man would like a word.

Captain Hindsight

Please, sit down. What can I do for you?

Cartman

Mr. Hindsight, I represent some very high-profile people, [sets his briefcase on the table and opens it] and I've been asked to give you some really exciting news. [takes out an application to join Coon and Friends and hands it to Hindsight] You, have been pre-approved to become the newest member, of Coon and Friends.

Captain Hindsight

[takes the application] Of what?

Cartman

I know the Coon personally, and I can tell you, being a Coon friend is the very highest honor. As you can see in those papers, your first three months of dues have actually been waived. This must be amazingly exciting for you.

Officer 2

[from one of the 36 screens] Captain Hindsight? Captain Hindsight, please come in! [Hindsight walks over to see what the matter is]

Captain Hindsight

Go ahead.

Officer 2

The oil keeps coming out! We've got other rigs now catching fire!

Captain Hindsight

Listen! They should have hosed down the other rigs as soon as the spill began, and that wouldn't have happened.

Officer 2

Right. [salutes] Thank you! [Hindsight salutes back. Another screen comes on to his right]

Fireman 2

Captain Hindsight! The dolphins that those volunteers cleaned of oil, they, they're all dying!

Captain Hindsight

Get down to the volunteers and tell them they should have used a non-bleaching cleanser! Commissioner!

Commissioner

Yes?

Captain Hindsight

Tell Brett Favre he should have never sent actual pictures of his schlong! [the screen the commissioner was on switches over to Santa Monica Pier as Hindsight shows his fatigue] It's not a blessing, it's a curse.

Cartman

[waits a few seconds, then] ...So, anyways, if you wanna just start filling out the form, we'll get you enrolled in Coon and Friends right away.

Captain Hindsight

Look, I'm sorry kid, but I work alone.

Cartman

Well, see, the problem with that is there's a superhero union called Coon and Friends. But if you refuse to be a part of that union. you are a scab!

Captain Hindsight

Get this kid out of here! I have to think!

Cartman

[gathers the form and puts it back in the briefcase] Fine! You'll be hearing from my lawy- the Coon's lawyer, sir! [walks away]

BP Crisis special report

Anchor Man

The BP Oil spill in the Gulf continues to get worse every day. As public anger towards the BP Company grows, their president released this statement:

+++++


A BP oil rig

Tony Hayward

[a soft acoustic guitar begins to play] Hello, I'm Tony Hayward, president and CEO of BP. Our accidental drilling spill again in the Gulf is a tragedy that should have never happened. And to all those affected, I want to say, we are deeply sorry. [switch to camera 2 to his left, and he turns to look at it] We're sorry. [on the tundra dressed in winter gear, stroking a baby arctic seal] We're sorry. [in the kitchen with an apron on, taking a tray of chocolate chip cookies from the oven] We're sorry. [skis towards the camera and stops] Sorry. [back on the oil rig] BP has taken full responsibility for cleaning up this spill in the Gulf, and in doing so, we've changed our name from Beyond Petroleum, to Dependable Petroleum. [a shot of the Earth and Moon in an interesting configuration. The Earth has two drills attached to it, the Moon has large creators that look similar to a face, and clouds look similar to flailing arms] We no longer fuck the earth, we DP it.

+++++


Coon Headquarters. The Coon has his friends gathered around his Coon table. "QUIET. COON-FERENCE IN SESSION"

Coon

Gentlemen, my attempts to recruit Captain Hindsight into Coon and Friends have been unsuccessful, but I believe I've come up with a solution. Coon Vision on! [a projector screen is shown, as is the projector on the table. Pictures begin to appear on screen] All we need to do is get pictures of Captain Hindsight naked with Courtney Love. Then we'll tell him if he doesn't join us, we'll put them on the Internet.

Toolshed

How do we get pictures of him naked with Courtney Love?

Coon

Simple, Toolshed. Coon slide 2? [the next slide clicks into place] We dress Professor Chaos up as Courtney Love, take pictures of him naked with a homeless guy, then photoshop Hindsight's face onto it.

Professor Chaos

Me?? Awww, come on, fellas, don't make me be Courtney Love.

Coon

Gotta get to work fast, people! Coon and Friends, ho!

Mosquito

...You want us to take naked pictures of Butters to use as blackmail? That doesn't sound very superhero-like.

Coon

That's because you think small, Mosquito! You have a tiny little mosquito brain, that's why you don't come up with the plan!

Mosquito

Nono, look. what's going on down in the Gulf is much more important than blackmailing another hero.

Mysterion

Agreed.

Coon

Oh who cares about some oil spill environment crap?!

Toolshed

Mosquito has a good plan, Cartman! Hear him out!

Coon

You don't know that I'm Cartman because my true identity is secret!

Mysterion

We all have a say in this organization, Coon! Let Mosquito talk!

Coon

[grudgingly] All right, Mosquito, how do you wanna help people suffering in the Gulf crisis? [crosses his arms]

Mosquito

I think we should help raise money for the relief aid by having a bake sale.

Coon

[challenging] A bake sale?

Mosquito

I have a recipe for lemon bars from my mom. We could wear our costumes outside the grocery store and sell lemon bars. Which would be a good deed, and help people.

Coon

We're superheroes, not the fucking Girl Scouts!

Mysterion

Those people down there need help! Sometimes being a hero means helping in smaller ways.

Iron Maiden

Timmeh!

Coon

[challenging] You think selling lemon bars is helpful to mankind?

Mint-Berry Crunch

More helpful than taking naked pictures of Butters.

Coon

Shut up, Mint-Berry Crunch! You aren't even anything!

Mosquito

And that's another thing: no more picking on Mint-Berry Crunch!

Coon

Oh, what are you, the boss now?!

Mosquito

No, but we are all equal! From now on, we vote! Who wants to go with my plan? [everybody but Coon raises a hand. The Iron Maiden lifts a sword]

Coon

[crosses his arms again, sarcastic] Sounds awesome. Let's do it.

Toolshed

To the grocery store!

+++++


A street in the neighborhood. Coon leads his friends down the street. A classical piece plays as the boys are shown in slow motion.

Coon

[thinking] As we walked along the road to the grocery store, my Coon sense started tingling. Something was wrong. Very wrong. I've learned to trust my Coon sense. It has always been my guide. And so I knew I must act. A coon must know when to defend itself. [Coon turns to his right and high-kicks Mospuito on the cheek. Mosquito goes up in the air and bounces on the road. Coon kicks him in the balls and leaps at him, and grins. He spreads his claws out and slashes Mosquito on the left temple. Mint-Berry Crunch moves to intervene while Coon continues to rake Mosquito across the face. Coon notices Mint-Berry Crunch coming to Mosquito's aid and slashes him too.]

+++++


A dinner, later. Coon and his friends are seated around a large table. Mosquito and Mint-Berry Crunch are battered and bruised. Mosquito's vuvuzela snout is crimped

Coon

[after a while] Well, now we're back to normal. [smiles] Just like before and all forgotten? Right right?

Mint-Berry Crunch

[defeated] Right right.

Mosquito

[defeated] Right.

Coon

Keewwwl! So what's next for Coon and Friends? [no one says a word, and Coon takes a sip of his soda]

+++++


Another BP Crisis special report

Anchor Man

Another crisis in the Gulf of Mexico as the oil company DP has once again made a huge error. [a glowing plasma seeps out of a big hole while strange creatures float and walk out of there] This time, the oil company has accidentally ripped a hole into another dimension. [beachgoers run for their lives as a many-mouthed three-legged creature lumbers by. A flying creature drops down on a woman, scoops her up in its tentacles, and rips her in two at the waist. Other winged creatures swoop in and abduct other beachgoers. Different creatures walk by the pier and scoop up visitors there, then drop them into open mouths that look like Venus fly traps] The oil company stated that it knew a portal to another dimension was there, but didn't think drilling into it would prove problematic. [two men are fishing when another creature pops up and eats them] Now hundreds of creatures from another dimension are spilling out into our reality and wreaking havoc. [a giant starfish creature sits on the pier floor when a man gets curious and leans in. It snaps shut, leaving him headless. Everyone else jumps back and a woman screams]

+++++


Hayward's BP oil rig

Tony Hayward

[a soft acoustic guitar begins to play] Hello, I'm Tony Hayward, CEO of DP. Tearing a hole into another dimension is a tragedy that should have never happened. And as CEO, I would like to say... We're sorry. [sitting in an armchair by the fireplace stroking a sleeping lap puppy] We're sorry. [sitting in a prairie holding a dandelion] We're sorry. [blows the seeds off the dandelion stem. Next, he's in bed looking up somewhat seductively] Sohr-ry.

+++++


Jack Brolin's mansion, day. Captain Hindsight is at his desk looking glum.

Butler

[appears] Captain Hindsight! Sir! Calls for help are pouring in! You've got to get out to the Gulf!

Captain Hindsight

I can't help anyone right now! Something came up.

Butler

What, sir? You know you can tell me.

Captain Hindsight

Do you remember last week when I... got really really drunk?

Butler

Yes sir.

Captain Hindsight

Look at those photos on the desk. [the butler walks up to the desk and looks at the photos. The first one is Butters as Courtney Love posing for the camera and the homeless man standing on a stool behind him naked, with Hindsight's face photoshopped onto him. Next, it's Butters on the stool with the homeless man standing behind him. Next, it's Butters posing for the camera and standing on the homeless man's back]

Butler

My God, is that you and... Courtney Love?

Captain Hindsight

'Course it's Courtney Love!

Butler

But when did you have a-

Captain Hindsight

I don't remember! That's just the point! I get drunk, I don't remember things! I shouldn't have drank that much, and I shouldn't have mixed alcohols! Alcohol shouldn't be legal! Oh it's maddening!

Butler

That doesn't matter now, sir! People are getting hurt in the Gulf and they need to know what they could've done!

Captain Hindsight

I should have never kept that bottle of Macallan in the pantry! I should have never gotten around Courtney Love and a camera. I should-

Butler

Sir! SIR!

+++++


Another BP Crisis special report, continued

Reporter

Creatures from another dimension continue to wreak havoc in the Gulf, and the question everyone is asking is, "Where is Captain Hindsight?"

Rescuer 6

Where are you, Captain Hindsight?

Cajun Shrimp Merchant

Where are d'you countih ninety-oh bebbly now is showmesitchcum.

Reporter

With Captain Hindsight missing, what superheroes can save the Gulf now?

+++++


Coon Headquarters. The Coon has his friends gathered around his Coon table. His smear campaign is a complete success

Coon

My fellow superheroes, I have done it. Hindsight is taken care of. And now the country can finally be made aware of Coon and Friends!

Toolshed

There's more important things to discuss right now!

Coon

Right, Toolshed. Now, how do we deal with these creatures from another dimension?

Mysterion

He means we need to discuss things with you!

Coon

Okay, what?

Mysterion

Aw, I don't wanna tell him. TupperWear, you tell him!

TupperWear

I don't wanna tell him either.

The Human Kite

I'll tell him. Coon, I'm sorry, but we're kicking you out of Coon and Friends.

Coon

You're kicking me out of Coon and Friends.

Toolshed

We all voted, it was unanimous.

Coon

You can't kick me out of Coon and Friends, I'm the fucking Coon!

The Human Kite

Look, we just believe that you have your goals and ways of doing things and they conflict with what we want to accomplish.

Mysterion

But we get the headquarters and all the equipment.

Coon

You don't keep anything! This is my basement and I'll tell my mom on you guys!

Mysterion

We've already discussed this with her. Mrs. Cartman? [she walks in and approaches Mysterion]

Liane

Yes, Mysterion?

Mysterion

Please escort the Coon out of our secret base.

Liane

[takes Coon away from the table and up the stairs] Eric, I talked to you about beating up your friends, didn't I?

Coon

Mom, what the fuck?! The fuck are you doing?!

+++++


upstairs. Liane takes Coon out of the basement and shuts the door. Coon tries to get back in, but can't

Liane

Eric, you do not beat up your friends! And I told you I've had it with your language! [crosses her arms] Your punishment is that your friends will just play superheroes without you! Go to your room!

Coon

[incredulous] You've gotta be fucking kidding me!

+++++


The DP boardroom, day.

DP Executive 1

Oh dear, we have certainly pooped our trousers this time!

Tony Hayward

Yes, I'm afraid it's going to take more than another "I'm sorry" campaign to please everyone this time.

DP Executive 2

Oh, what a right pickle we're in. [a flying creature floats up past the windows carrying a screaming man]

DP Executive 3

There is no way to cut the dimensional portal, I'm afraid. The ocean currents and swells are simply too much to get any machines in.

Tony Hayward

Wait a tick! [rises] Currents and swells, that's it! I think I know how to fix this!

DP Executive 4

How, by Jove?

Tony Hayward

We drill.

DP Executives

Drill of course, yes, yes, of course.

Tony Hayward

I believe that if we drill on the moon, changing its gravitational pull on our ocean swells, we could cut the dimensional spill.

DP Executive 5

I don't quite get it.

Tony Hayward

We got into this mess by drilling heuh [the Gulf of Mexico], and heuh [somewhere in Peru]. Now, we need to drill heuh! [draws a drill bit entering the moon]

DP Executive 6

That looks extremely promising!

Tony Hayward

Our environment should stabilize if it's getting drilled here, here, and here at the same time.

DP Executive 6

The seismic forces will be massive. Do you think the moon can take it?

Tony Hayward

[arms crossed] Oh, she'll take it.

+++++


A launch pad, day. A DP rocket takes off

+++++


The moon. DP's newest rig is now up and running as DP astronauts spread out from the rig. Nearby are the bodies of Willzy-x and Tom Cruise

Anchor Man

The DP Oil Company today drilled into the moon and appears to have caused even greater problems.

Stan

Uh oh, I have a feeling we'd better get into our costumes again, guys.

Tom, the DP Oil Company has had another drilling accident. [Cthulhu appears looming over the oil rig in the Gulf] This time they appear to have unleashed the dark and mighty Cthulhu. [Cthulhu swats a helicopter down with just a gentle wave of his right arm] The rise of Cthulhu from another dimension brings about three thousand years of darkness, Tom, where we will all be driven to madness and made to service Cthulhu's cult as slaves. The president of DP Oil released this press statement:
