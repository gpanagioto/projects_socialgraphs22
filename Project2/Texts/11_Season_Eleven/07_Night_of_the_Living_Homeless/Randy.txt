Well I was thinking: We could turn the homeless into tires, so that we'd still have homeless, but we could use them, on our cars. You mean they've adapted, copied our DNA. No, sorry, I don't have any change. No, sorry.  Huh! I don't have any change.  No!  Leave me alone I don't have any change! Oh, now I ''feel'' bad.  Nono, that was really all the change I had. I just gave you change! Wahhh! I don't have any more change!   Stay awayhay! Stay awa- ...I don't have any change!  I don't have any chaaaahahange! Help! Help us!  No sign of anybody else.  Don't be crazy, Gerald. You'll never get through all those homeless people. You won't make it through, Gerald!   He's become one of them. We don't have any change! Go away! Find another place to hide, Steve! There isn't enough food for more people up here! All right all right, fine!   Harrrh!  That's it. That's it, everyone. We're out of Pop-Tarts. Face it, we're gonna starve! Those are cherry! Ich! How? Call the fire department. He's homeless now. We aren't safe. Not yet. It's only a matter of time. If we have to! Siddown Glen!
