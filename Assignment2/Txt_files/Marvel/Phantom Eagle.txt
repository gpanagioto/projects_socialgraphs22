'''Phantom Eagle''' is the name used by two fictional aviator heroes appearing in [[American comic book]]s.

The first character to use the name was teenaged Mickey Malone, a young aviator who appeared in the 1940s in  [[Fawcett Comics]] publications depicting contemporaneous [[World War II]] adventures. The second and better-known character, created in the 1960s by [[Marvel Comics]], was Karl Kaufman, the American son of German parents, who became a masked [[World War I]] ace.

===Publication history===
The first Phantom Eagle was introduced by uncredited creators in [[Fawcett Comics]]' ''[[Wow Comics]]'' #6 ([[cover-date]]d July 1942), during the period fans and historians call the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Benton |first1=Mike |title=Superhero Comics of the Golden Age: The Illustrated History |date=1992 |publisher=Taylor Publishing Company |location=Dallas |isbn=0-87833-808-X |url=https://archive.org/details/superherocomicso0000bent/page/192 |access-date=1 April 2020 |page=192}}</ref> Following his debut, the Phantom Eagle appeared in every issue of ''Wow Comics'', and by the final issue, #69 (August 1948) was a sidekick to Commando Yank. His primary writer-artist was [[Marc Swayze]].<ref name=gcd>[http://www.comics.org/character/name/phantom%20eagle/sort/chrono/ Phantom Eagle] (character, both Fawcett and Marvel versions) at the [[Grand Comics Database]]</ref>

===Fictional character biography===
The Phantom Eagle was teenager Mickey Malone, who, though forbidden by superior officer Sergeant Flog at his military airbase in Great Britain, was determined to fight the World War II Axis powers. Donning an aviator-styled costume and building his own airplane, he takes the name Phantom Eagle and becomes a secret ace.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Nevins |first1=Jess |title=Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes |date=2013 |publisher=High Rock Press |isbn=978-1-61318-023-5 |page=205}}</ref>

He later forms the Phoenix Squadron, a group of fellow teen pilots. During the post-war period, Malone formed a charter airline and searched for the Golden Chalice, a lost artifact upon which is inscribed the "Formula for Peace".<ref>[http://toonopedia.com/phaneagf.htm Phantom Eagle (Fawcett Comics)] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]].

===Publication history===
The second Phantom Eagle was an unrelated [[World War I]] hero created by writer [[Gary Friedrich]] and artist [[Herb Trimpe]] in ''[[Marvel Super-Heroes (comics)|Marvel Super-Heroes]]'' #16 (September 1968).<ref name="gcd"/><ref>{{cite book|last1 = DeFalco|first1 = Tom|author-link = Tom DeFalco|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2008|page = 131|isbn =978-0756641238|quote= Aviation buff Herb Trimpe, who flew his own biplane for many years, teamed up with writer Gary Friedrich to create flying ace the Phantom Eagle.}}</ref> As Trimpe described, Marvel production manager [[John Verpoorten]] "had been a classmate at [[School of Visual Arts|SVA]].

He said they were hiring freelance people, and I should come up to the office and show my work to [[Sol Brodsky]], who was [[Stan Lee|Stan [Lee]'s]] right-hand man at the time. I said, 'Okay'.

'''Note:''' Per the [[Grand Comics Database]], Trimpe had actually made his professional penciling debut with two [[Kid Colt]] Western stories, in ''[[Kid Colt, Outlaw]]'' #134–135 (May & July 1967).</ref>

Trimpe in 2002 described the character's creation:
{{quote|[T]he Phantom Eagle was primarily Gary Friedrich's idea. He knew I was interested in airplanes and that kind of stuff, so he came up with this wacko idea that became the Phantom Eagle. However, I could not quite justify this Americanized version of some sort of WWI combat ace. ... There was too much of a superhero in the character. If you know anything of that time in history or the feel of that time, you would know that it was just so wrong. But it was fun and I got to make up some of the airplanes. ... [T]he Phantom Eagle airplanes were all made up, and not patterned after a real airplane, but an original design by me. ... It had a kind of corny design pattern painted on it, like wings and that kind of stuff, which was not that far from what the pilots painted on their planes. But that character was what [[Roy Rogers]] and [[Gene Autry]] were to the American [[Western fiction|Western]] – totally Hollywoodized.<ref name=tart>{{cite web |url=http://www.sequentialtart.com/article.php?id=1593 |title=Hulk-inued!

The character made few appearances beyond his debut. The first was a time travel story in ''[[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' (vol. 2) #135 (January 1971). Next came a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] appearance in ''[[Ghost Rider]]'' #12 (June 1975), in which the Phantom Eagle, as the cover proclaimed, was a real phantom. ''[[The Invaders (comics)|The Invaders]]'' #7 (July 1976) [[retconned]] the character as a member of the [[Freedom's Five]], a newly created World War I team of costumed adventurers never subsequently seen. The Phantom Eagle also appeared for two panels in ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor Corps]]'' #3 (November 1993), when the antagonist briefly alters reality.<ref name=gcd />

''Ghost Rider'' #50 (November 1980) contains a page of pinup art by Trimpe that one historian speculates<ref>[http://comics.org/details.lasso?id=34844#4 ''Ghost Rider'' #50] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> may have been an unused cover of issue #12.

In 2014's ''[[All-New Invaders]]'' #12, there's a flashback of Freedom's Five and it is revealed that Phantom Eagle died at the end of the war.

===Fictional character biography===
In 1914, Karl Kaufman was a skilled American pilot from [[Oshkosh, Wisconsin]], whose German parents had returned to their native country. Kaufman had become an expert stunt-pilot and co-owner of a flying circus, by 1917, when the United States entered [[World War I]], and desired to fight the [[Central Powers]]. Concealing his identity so as not to risk reprisals against his parents, he devised a stylized aviator uniform with darkened goggles and a cape, and joined the European conflict to become an ace on the side of the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] as a U.S. Army Air Corps test pilot. In his first mission as Phantom Eagle, he successfully led a U.S. fighter squadron against an experimental dirigible aircraft carrier with which German forces attempted to invade New York; however, he witnessed the death of his best friend, Rex Griffin, as a result.<ref>[http://toonopedia.com/phaneagm.htm Phantom Eagle (Marvel Comics)] at Don Mark Stein's Toonopedia. [https://www.webcitation.org/66vyrqf0M?url=http://www.toonopedia.com/phaneagm.htm Archived] from the original on April 15, 2012.</ref> At one point the time-traveling dictator [[Kang the Conqueror]] sent the simpleminded brute the [[Hulk]] back to 1917 in an effort to secure a victory for Germany, by preventing the Phantom Eagle from destroying a key German super-weapon.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' (vol. 2) #135</ref> Another time, a brief altering of reality saw the Phantom Eagle's [[biplane]] pursued by modern [[jet fighter]]s.<ref>''Thor Corps'' #3 (Nov. 1993)</ref>

The Phantom Eagle went on to join the team of costumed adventurers known as [[Freedom's Five]], consisting of himself (the sole American), the [[Crimson Cavalier]], the [[Silver Squire]], [[Sir Steel]], and [[Union Jack (comics)#Union Jack (James Montgomery)|Union Jack]].<ref>Recounted in ''The Invaders'' #7.</ref>

Kaufman and his parents were later killed together near the end of the war by German pilot Hermann von Reitberger, who strafed both the Phantom Eagle and the two civilians with his machine guns as they fled from Germany into Alsace, France. Swearing vengeance, the Phantom Eagle's spirit haunted and hunted von Reitberger through the years until, after a chance, modern-day encounter with the original [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Ghost Rider]], he battled the aged German in aerial combat. With von Reitberger's death, Kaufman's [[vengeful spirit]] was allowed to pass on.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' #12 (June 1975)</ref>

Sometime later, the ghost of the Phantom Eagle's plane assisted Doctor Strange and the Punisher. They were trying to stop a collection of mystically powered mobsters.<ref>''Doctor Strange/Punisher: Magic Bullets'' #1-4 (2016)</ref>

===Powers and abilities===
The Phantom Eagle was a normal man with no superhuman powers. He possessed good hand-to-hand fighting skills, and was an expert stunt-flyer and combat pilot. He customized his own World War I vintage biplane.

===Other versions===
====Counter-Earth Phantom Eagle====
Another Phantom Eagle exists on [[Counter-Earth (comics)|Counter-Earth]], located on the far side of the sun.<ref>''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'' #59 (February 2002)</ref> He is the counterpart of [[Nefarius]], the Lloyd Bloch of the [[Earth-616|main Marvel Universe]].{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}
