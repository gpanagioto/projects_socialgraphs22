I'm coming, Ma!   Oh! Hey, Kenny. I can't watch the meteor shower with you, Kenny. I have to go to Jewbilee. It's what we do in Jew Scouts. Usually we just sit around and make stuff. But tonight, because there's a meteor shower, we're gonna do some big thing out in the woods. It's gonna suck ass, I'm sure. Hey! Maybe you can come with me. Then it won't suck so hard. Mom? Can Kenny go to Jewbilee with me? ...Oh. Kenny isn't special? Kenny'll believe whatever you want him to. Please, Ma. I don't think Kenny has anywhere else to be tonight. No, Ike! Ma, Ike keeps taking off his Squirt uniform! No, Ike! I don't think Ike wants to go to Squirts. What? You want me to lie? Oh. Ike, Squirts is so much fun-- Wow, cool. He was huge.  Who are you? You have to go with him, Ike. Don't worry, Ike. Squirts is fun. And I'll be right over there in the next building.  Kyle Broflovski. Uh, Kenny McHeinenberg. This is where the elders meet. Nobody is allowed to go in there when they're having a meeting. That's you, Kenny. Raise your hand.  This part kinda sucks, Kenny, but don't screw it up.  Come on, Kenny. You have to get in the circle. This is where we all stand in a circle and pray to Moses for guidance during Jewbilee. It is not stupid, Kenny! This is my faith and you shouldn't make fun of it!    Don't worry. I know what to do. Elder, It's not my fault. He told me he was Jewish. He doesn't get cake? Dude, what the hell is going on?! Don't worry, you guys. He forgot about Kenny. Kenny will help us. Kenny will find a way. Go, Ike! What is that? Look!  Kenny! Noooooo! Kenny!  You know, I think we all learned something today. It's fine to have your own beliefs and your own traditions, but as soon as you start excluding people from your ways, only because of their race, you become separatists. And being a separatist sucks ass.
