Welcome to the Kingdom of Heaven, Kenny. I am Peter. There isn't much time, Kenny. You're dead, but, your death was no accident. Heaven needs you. Come! There is much to discuss.  But knowing that Hell was becoming much larger, God decided to let more people cross over so that he could build an army as well, an army that YOU must command. The Sony PSP was built by God, to determine who on Earth had the best skills to defeat the armies of Satan. You... are the best. YOU, are the only hope for the universe. He beat Satan's army in over three thousand separate simulations. Satan's army has crossed over the Plains of Limbo! Kenny! Bless your soul! You've saved all of Heaven!
