===Death-Stalker's Ani-Men===
The Exterminator, now known as the Death-Stalker, recruits a new team of Ani-Men, with a new Ape-Man, Bird-Man, and Cat-Man.<ref>''Daredevil'' #157. Marvel Comics.</ref> He sends the new Ani-Men to capture [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Matt Murdock]].

Marvel Comics.</ref>

===High Evolutionary's Ani-Men===
A new group wearing the name Ani-Men are a bunch of [[New Men (Marvel Comics)|New Men]] created by the [[High Evolutionary]] that carries out his orders. The High Evolutionary's Ani-Men included Buzzard (an evolved [[hawk]]), Crushtacean (an evolved [[crab]]), Flying Fox (an evolved [[bat]]), [[Komodo (comics)|Komodo]] (an evolved [[Komodo dragon]]), and Spinneret (an evolved [[spider]]). The Evolutionary dispatches the Ani-Men to a laboratory operated by his former assistant Miles Warren (the [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]]) to clean up Warren's files. After three weeks, the Ani-Men are almost done with their cleanup and have spread a virus into all of Warren's files, but they are discovered by the [[Scarlet Spider]]. When the High Evolutionary teleports the Ani-Men back to his home base at Wundagore, the Scarlet Spider is accidentally brought with them, having stuck himself to Crushtacean with his webbing. Later, the Scarlet Spider joins members of the Cult of the Jackal in sneaking into the citadel of the High Evolutionary in an attempt to learn the truth about Warren's involvement with the High Evolutionary. The Ani-Men come to face the cult members and the Scarlet Spider, but the fight is brought to an end after the Scarlet Spider is able to learn the truth from the High Evolutionary. The High Evolutionary sends the Scarlet Spider home, but Crushtacean foolishly touches a ball of impact webbing the hero has left behind, covering himself and the other Ani-Men with webbing, much to their embarrassment.<ref>''Scarlet Spider Unlimited'' #1 (November, 1995).
