How much damage is that? I think Nichole and Tammy are cool to play with. You mean like Nemo's War? Nemo's War is sweet. Well if you want something hard, then you need a really crunchy Euro game, something like a Vital Lacerda's Escape Plan or a Uwe Rosenburg Euro. Well all Euros are pretty mathy. So then you want a war miniatures game. Something skirmish-style, like Legion or Blood and Plunder. Whoa, you painted your miniatures? Where'd you learn to do that? I love BGG. Wow! What? Who says? Well, who made up that stupid rule?
