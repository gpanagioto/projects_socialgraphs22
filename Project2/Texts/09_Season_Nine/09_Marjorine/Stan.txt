Yeah, us too. What? Oh my God, how does it know the answer? So what do you suggest? Yeah, there's just one problem: a boy can't go to a chicks' slumber party. But if one of us pretends to be the new girl in class, the girls will wonder where that boy went. All right, Butters, that's Heidi's house. Yeah dude, of course. Now go, the party's already started. Maybe they found him out. Come on, we gotta go check on him.  He's just dancing around. Come on, Butters. Ho-Hold on on guys. We're not sure what this device is capable of. Maybe we should wait until we've had more time to study it. Guys, guys, guys, stop!  Look at what this thing is doing to us. Butters was trying to tell me something outside the house. That this device is nothing but trouble. I think I know what he meant now. We risked everything to get it from the girls. How long before the girls attack us to get it back? And then what? Hide it forever from the government? From the... terrorists who want to use it for evil? Maybe... maybe nobody is meant to have this kind of power. We got it away from the girls. That's what matters. But now the right thing to do isn't using it ourselves, then we're no better than they are. Nobody will. That's the way it's suppose to be. Hit it, Kenny.
