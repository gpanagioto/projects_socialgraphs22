==Fictional character biography==
[[File:DeathofCaptainMarvel.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Death on Comic cover: ''The Death of [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]]'' (1982). Art by [[Jim Starlin]].]]
Death is an abstract entity, embodiment of life ending in the [[Marvel Universe]], and the opposite of [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]], embodiment of the universe.<ref>''Quasar'' #19-25 (Feb.-Aug. 1991)</ref> Death is predominantly depicted as a skeleton cloaked in a black or purple robe, and at times appears as a Caucasian human female.

A storyline in the title ''[[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]]'' showcases [[Thanos]]' scheme to conquer the universe, as the character becomes determined to prove his love for Death by destroying all life. Although Thanos obtains the artifact the [[Cosmic Cube]] and succeeds in taking control of the universe, Death abandons the character when he is defeated by the combined might of Captain Marvel, [[Drax the Destroyer]] and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref name="autogenerated1" /> Two Marvel Annuals feature Thanos as he tries to "woo" Death back (courtesy of the [[Infinity Gems]] with which he plans to extinguish every star in the galaxy), but is killed in a final battle with the Avengers, Captain Marvel and [[Adam Warlock]].<ref>''The Avengers'' Annual #7 + ''Marvel Two-In-One'' Annual #2 (1977)</ref> When Captain Marvel is dying from cancer, Thanos returns to the character in a vision and introduces him to the entity Death. Marvel willingly surrenders his life and embraces the entity.<ref>''The Death of Captain Marvel'' (Apr. 1982)</ref>

In Marvel's first [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''[[Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions|Contest of Champions]]'', Death agrees to a game of strategy with the [[Elder of the Universe]] the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]]. The Grandmaster wins the game and Death provides him with the power (via the Golden Globe of Life) to resurrect the [[Collector (comics)|Collector]],<ref>Killed by the entity [[Korvac]] in ''[[The Avengers (comic)|The Avengers]]'' #175 (Sept. 1978)</ref> a fellow Elder. Only then does Death reveal that the Golden Globe is an empty instrument that needs to be powered by a life-force equal to that of the being who is to be restored. To resurrect the Collector, the Grandmaster sacrifices his life and takes the Collector's place in the Realm of the Dead.<ref>''Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions'' #1-3 (Jun-Aug. 1982)</ref> In the limited series ''[[Secret Wars II]]'' the entity [[Beyonder]] takes human form and visits Earth. It decides to "save" mankind, and in doing so destroys Death. The Beyonder is then shown there is a need for Death and transforms his friend, a human reporter name Dave, into Death's new personification.<ref>''Secret Wars II'' #6 (Dec. 1985)</ref>

In an ''Avengers'' Annual, the Grandmaster reveals his sacrifice was a ruse as he's able to steal Death's powers and via another deception tricks the entity into banishing all Elders from the Realm of the Dead, effectively rendering them [[Immortality|immortal]].<ref>''The Avengers'' Annual #16 (1987)</ref> The threads of this storyline continue in the title ''[[Silver Surfer]]'' where a group of 11 Elders conspires to use the [[Infinity Gems]] to kill the cosmic entity [[Galactus]] and thereby destroy reality itself. After their plan is thwarted, Galactus devours 5 Elders, assuming that his status as a being who transcends Death and Eternity means that he does not have to abide by Death's vow. However, Galactus finds the Elders difficult to absorb and Death is displeased that Galactus has chosen to ignore her vow.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3 #10 (April 1988)</ref> Subsequently, when 3 Elders – the [[Astronomer (comics)|Astronomer]]; [[Possessor (comics)|Possessor]], and [[Trader (comics)|Trader]] – threaten to use the Infinity Gems to prevent the [[In-Betweener]] from hurling Galactus (with their brother Elders still inside him) into a black hole, the conceptual being responds by summoning Death and forcing her to negate the 3 Elders against her will, a transgression that Death finds heinous.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3 #17 (Nov. 1988)</ref>

The limited series ''[[The Thanos Quest]],'' reveals that Death perceives an imbalance in the universe and a gradual shift towards life rather than death; the entity resurrects Thanos. Thanos successfully collects the [[Infinity Gems]], and attempts to converse with Death on its own level. The irony is the character is now superior to Death, and as such Death may not speak with him (a fact relayed via one of Death's minions).<ref>''Thanos Quest'' #1-2 (Sept.-Oct. 1990)</ref> The story continues in a consecutive limited series ''[[The Infinity Gauntlet]]'', in which Thanos then wipes half the beings in the universe from existence as proof of his love for Death; the entity remains and watches as he battles Earth's metahumans, but after they are defeated, Death joins the cosmic pantheon in trying to defeat Thanos. Though the cosmic entities are unsuccessful, Thanos eventually loses the Infinity Gems and is defeated.<ref>''The Infinity Gauntlet'' #1-6 (July-Dec. 1991)</ref>

The mercenary [[Deadpool]] is depicted having a humorous exchange with the entity in a ''Deadpool Annual''. He becomes infatuated with Death after having a number of near-death experiences.<ref name="autogenerated2" /> During the ''Funeral for a Freak'' storyline, Death appears to reciprocate the feeling, and a jealous Thanos prevents Deadpool from dying and joining the entity by cursing him with immortality.<ref name="autogenerated3" /> In the second volume of ''Captain Marvel'', Death reunites with Thanos to confront the Death God Walker, who tries unsuccessfully to court Death. Death hides within the body of [[Marlo Chandler]] (girlfriend of [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]]) in an attempt to escape Walker. The entity eventually destroys Walker and then leaves the body of Marlo, although Marlo retains a connection to Death which (in extreme circumstances) allows her to access the cosmic powers of Death.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' vol. 2 #17-19 (Feb.-Mar. 2001)</ref>

The limited series ''[[Avengers: Celestial Quest]]'' continues to explore the relationship between Death and Thanos. As the entity reveals to Thanos that their energies merged when he was resurrected, creating an offspring called the Rot. Death and Thanos work together to destroy their offspring, and it is at this time that Death finally addresses Thanos and admits to feeling "love" for him.<ref>''Avengers: Celestial Quest'' #1-8 (Sept. 2001-Apr. 2002)</ref> The pair also share a kiss in the limited series ''[[Marvel: The End]]'', moments before Thanos, possessing the artifact the [[Heart of the Universe]], recreates the universe minus a critical flaw that would have destroyed it.<ref>''Marvel: The End'' #1-6 (May-Aug. 2003)</ref>

During the limited series ''[[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]]'', Thanos joins the fight to stop the [[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation Wave]], and during the war is killed by his old foe [[Drax the Destroyer]]. When the hero [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]] is near death from injuries sustained in battle, he glimpses Death and Thanos standing together watching him.<ref>''Annihilation'' #6 (Mar. 2007): ''Annihilation'' #1-6 (Oct. 2006-Mar. 2007)</ref> The second volume of the ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' features a new development: [[Phyla-Vell]], the heroine [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]], agrees to become the new [[Incarnation|avatar]] of Oblivion (an aspect of Death) in exchange for the freedom of lover [[Moondragon|Heather Douglas]].<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' vol. 2 #12 (May 2009)</ref>

In ''[[The Thanos Imperative]]'', the Captain Marvel of the Cancerverse, called Lord Mar-Vell, using a ritual to the [[Many-angled ones]] that involves sacrificing the Avatar of Death, is able to destroy Death's M-body and remove her from his universe.<ref>''The Thanos Imperative'' #3 (Oct. 2010)</ref> In the last issue of this 6-part mini-series, it is revealed that Thanos, upon coming back to life, has been completely removed from the realm of death and can no longer die. In a twist he appears to accept Lord Mar-Vell's proposal to be a sacrifice so the Many-angled ones can invade the [[Earth-616|616 universe]]; however, this proves a trap set by Death herself in order to get close to Mar-Vell. By destroying him, she kills every living thing in the Cancerverse, initiates its and the Fault's collapse, and even injures the Many-angled ones to such a degree that it will take them eons to heal.<ref>''The Thanos Imperative'' #6 (Jan. 2011)</ref>

During the ''[[Chaos War (comics)|Chaos War]]'' storyline, [[Daimon Hellstrom]] mentions to Hercules that Death has fled their reality upon [[Amatsu-Mikaboshi (comics)|Amatsu-Mikaboshi]] triumphing in the realms of the dead, causing the souls of the deceased to be unleashed upon the Earth, and rendering the victims of the siege, whose injuries might otherwise prove fatal, merely locked in a deathless limbo.<ref>''Chaos War'' #2</ref>

Following the ''[[Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy]]'' storyline, Death has appeared in [[Las Vegas]] under the guise of Marlo Chandler to talk with [[Ben Reilly]] -the clone of [[Spider-Man]], recently brought back to life and spending some time acting as the new [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]]- initially instructing him to go after a duo of teen punks randomly shooting civilians around the city, claiming that she is testing what he will do about this discovery. Ben manages to find the criminals, shooting one of them twice with his own gun but avoiding causing fatal injuries, but when he is attacked by his "brother" and fellow clone [[Kaine Parker|Kaine]] after the death of a girl Reilly had been trying to treat for a serious illness, Marlo appears and kills Kaine with a single touch.<ref>''Ben Reilly: The Scarlet Spider'' #6</ref> "Marlo" subsequently identifies herself as Death and explains that she has an "interest" in Reilly as no other person has been brought back to life so often. She reveals that he has "died" so many times that his soul has become corrupted and if he undergoes one more resurrection, he will likely suffer so much spiritual damage that his soul will be broken for good. She offers Reilly the chance to restore Cassandra Mercury's daughter Abigail or Kaine to life before she departs. When Reilly asks her to save both of them and kill him instead, Death not only heals the other two, but also restores Reilly to a healthy physical appearance. Death also affirms that he has made a start on his efforts to redeem himself of his sins as the Jackal and to become a hero again.<ref>''Ben Reilly: The Scarlet Spider'' #7</ref> However, after Ben Reilly brutally beats a civilian who was responsible for the theft of food donations to a charity drive,<ref>''Ben Reilly: The Scarlet Spider'' #10</ref> Death reveals that the healing of his scars only remains so long as Reilly does not compromise his status as a hero, with the aforementioned beating leading to him regaining scars around his right eye.<ref>''Ben Reilly: The Scarlet Spider'' #11</ref>

== Reception ==

=== Critical reception ===
Marco Vito Oddo of ''[[Collider (website)|Collider]]'' referred to Lady Death as a "fan-favorite cosmic entity," saying, "Death was born alongside the universe and is the embodiment of destruction. While that might sound ominous, destruction is needed to maintain balance, making Lady Death one of the fundamental forces keeping the universe together."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Oddo |first=Marco Vito |date=2022-05-26 |title=Who Are the 5 Marvel Cosmic Entities in the New ‘Thor: Love and Thunder’ Trailer? |url=https://collider.com/thor-love-and-thunder-trailer-marvel-cosmic-entities-explained/ |access-date=2022-08-10 |website=Collider |language=en-US}}</ref> Ajay Aravind of ''[[CBR.com]]'' called Lady Death a "vital player in the [[Marvel Universe]]," writing, "Although she has not had much of a role to play in the various Marvel storylines, the times that Lady Death has been included have centralized her character to the extent of placing her on a literal pedestal."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Aravind |first=Ajay |date=2020-09-02 |title=Marvel Comics: 10 Things Fans Should Know About Lady Death |url=https://www.cbr.com/marvel-comics-lady-death-facts-thanos/ |access-date=2022-08-10 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref> Kayleigh Donaldson of ''[[Syfy]]'' wrote, "It’s no wonder that modern pop culture has enjoyed fleshing out its grim heroes beyond their skeletal foundations. [..] In [[Marvel Comics]], Lady Death's power is so alluring, and the woman herself so hypnotically sexy, that Thanos tries to destroy half of all living beings in the universe just to impress her."<ref>{{Cite web |date=2020-06-24 |title=The seduction of death (or, OK but what if the Grim Reaper is, like, hot?) |url=https://www.syfy.com/syfy-wire/the-seduction-of-death-or-what-if-the-grim-reaper-is-hot |access-date=2022-08-10 |website=SYFY Official Site |language=en-US}}</ref> Nat Brehmer of ''[[Screen Rant]]'' said, "Many fans were expecting, or at least hoping, to see Death in ''[[Avengers: Infinity War|Infinity War]]'' because of her ties to Thanos.
