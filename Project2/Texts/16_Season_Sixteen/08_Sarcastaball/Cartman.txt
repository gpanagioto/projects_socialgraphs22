That's right, Butters. Yeah, you know what?  Screw this! That's true.  Stan, hook up my bra. Who needs a coach? We have Butters. Butters, you understand this game better than anybody. Hey Butters, you got a minute? I don't now what to do. Kids are starting to make fun of me because, I'm no good at sarcastaball. I suck at being nice and polite. I'm so good at sucking I should work at a Thai massage parlor. No, I just don't have the mojo you have, Butters. ...I don't have a dad. You save it all? Butters, do you think your goo might work on someone else? Hm, it's kind of a grapey, bleachy flavor.  Holy shit I think I do. That kid is provoking us! He's saying mean things to try and piss us off. That's because you're too grumpy and negative to believe it. What you need... is a sports drink that can boost your levels of caring and goodness.
