Okay, children. I have some very exciting news for you... Oo-why don't you tell them, Mr. Twig? Nono, Kyle. These are ''independent'' films. Eric, if you call Wendy a bitch one more time, I'm sending you to the principal's office! That's it Eric, you-! Anyway, children, I want you all to see at least one independent film at the festival and then write a paper about it. The first film showing is called ''Witness To Denial'', and it's a sexual exploration piece about two women in love. Oh uh- hello, children. Oh I- I was just-uh hangin' out. Children, do you know how to file a police report? Good. See you in school.
