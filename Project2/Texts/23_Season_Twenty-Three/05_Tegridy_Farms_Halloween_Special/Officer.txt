People were attacked by an ancient Egyptian mummy. It killed five people and destroyed everything it could. Is it true, sir, that you and the mummy  "got into an argument over a gift you didn't seem to appreciate"? Did you throw the mummy out of your house? Well that's what the mummy told us about you. Calm down, sir! I can't understand you!
