 Hey, Kyle. Cool. That's cool. I saw a vagina, Kyle. I'm not holding a grudge. I'm happier now. I have purpose. My girlfriend's. She stood six feet away and flashed it really fast. But in that instant, you know what I saw? I saw that humankind can colonize Mars. I saw the potential of our species to terraform other planets and reach the infinite.  Of course you did 'cause you're amazing. Look at what I made you. That's what my baby wanted.  Oh sorry. Heidi, you know Kyle? Oh either way, we totally can. I, I guess Kyle has something to talk to us something about first, um.  Go ahead, Kyle. He said something about us working together to take down Butters. I'm not sure, Boo.  Heidi is amazing at figuring stuff out.  You want to know what's really going on? I'll tell you what's going on. Even though women have made great gains in the last century, there are still a part of men who aren't comfortable with women having power. It really just comes down to that, and then you have social media which allows men to anonymously say horrific things like "Women aren't funny," even though Heidi's like the funniest person I'be ever met.  No, it's true. Get over yourself. I know. You don't have to 'cause you're awesome.   Oh I see! You have a problem with Heidi. You're threatened by her because she actually has interesting things to say and she is funnier than you.  or is she just not funny because she's a girl?  Sorry, babe. It just really ruffles my feathers.  Look, Kyle, we're just out of it now. Humans on Mars.
