Yeah, it's all right here. Yeah, I went through it twice. People aren't ordering as much as last month.  What happened to our country? People are being wronged by a broken system, and we must say "NO MORE." No more homegrown marijuana. As the son of a proud American farmer, I am concerned about what homegrown can lead to. People can grow weed wrong and poison themselves. What? Unscrupulous growers could use cheap irrigation and drown babies. Oh, come on. The fact is simple. Marijuana must be grown with Tegridy.  Tegridy. Yeah, but Dad, you're gonna piss off everybody in South Park.
