This is why bullying is getting worse and worse at out schools! We can't all sit by and let it happen anymore! I'll do it! I'll be in charge. No, I just... I think bullying has gotten out of hand. And it needs to be stopped. Hey guys, guys! Don't pick on Butters! That's not cool. You can't do that. Bullying? Did you know that in America, hohoh,  At South Park Elementary we're better than that.

It needs to be seen by everybody, Kyle! ...What, what was the question again? ...Get, get out of here, Kyle! I'm trying to go to the bathroom!  Why does he keep saying that?

Dude, what's going on? Wha? What's the movie studio saying about it? How was I supposed to know Butters was actually a violent psychopath?  Everyone loved me sixteen hours ago.
