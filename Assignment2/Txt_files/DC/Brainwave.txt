==Publication history==
Brainwave first appeared in ''[[All-Star Squadron]]'' #24 (1983) and was created by [[Roy Thomas]], [[Jerry Ordway]] and Mike Machlan.<ref name="dc-ency"/><ref>{{cite web |last1=Martin |first1=Michileen |title=The history of DC's Brainwave explained |url=https://www.looper.com/251301/the-history-of-dcs-brainwave-explained/ |website=Looper.com |access-date=29 October 2020 |date=23 September 2020}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Hank King Jr. is the son of Hank King Sr. and [[Merry Pemberton]]. As the second Brainwave, he is a founding member of [[Infinity, Inc.]], creating the group in an attempt to bring honor to his family name. During the run of ''Infinity, Inc.'' Brainwave developed a relationship with fellow team member [[Jade (comics)|Jade]], daughter of the original [[Alan Scott|Green Lantern]].

When Hank's father died, he passed on his mental powers to his son, greatly increasing them and causing him to become somewhat unhinged. He dropped the "Jr." after Infinity Inc. disbanded, and dropped out of the public eye.<ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = Infinity, Inc.|Issue = #1-53|Date = (March 1984 through August 1988)|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>

He showed up years later, with a group he called the [[Legion of Doom (Super Friends)|Legion of Doom]]. They fought several members of the [[Justice League]].<ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = [[Extreme Justice]]|Issue = #14-18|Date = (March through July 1996)|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref> After that adventure, he reappeared in a mental institution that had been created specifically for him thanks to funds that came from the original Green Lantern, [[Alan Scott]]. Brainwave was still very ill and was almost slain by [[Obsidian (comics)|Obsidian]].<ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = Green Lantern/Sentinel: Heart of Darkness|Issue = #1-2|Date = (March & April 1998)|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref> He appeared again later in New York City, causing riots and general chaos with his telepathy, even mind controlling Jade and [[Alan Scott|Green Lantern (Alan Scott)]] until finally confronting [[Kyle Rayner]]. He left peacefully.<ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = Green Lantern|Volume = 3|Issue = #152|Date = (September 2002)|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>

He resurfaced again as part of [[Black Adam]]'s team, including Infinitors [[Northwind (comics)|Northwind]] and [[Albert Rothstein|Atom Smasher]], helping to liberate [[Kahndaq]]. In an attempt to stop Hank, considered the most dangerous member of the team, [[Hawkman (Carter Hall)|Hawkman]] had [[Ray Palmer (comics)|Ray Palmer]] shrink and enter Brainwave's body. Guided by [[Dr. Mid-Nite]], Palmer planned to operate on King's brain, specifically the abnormal mass of nerve fibers leading from the [[auditory cortex]] to a growth on the side of the [[inferior colliculus]], the supposed source of Brainwave's powers.

While a member of Black Adam's group, Brainwave acted both maliciously and in a calculating fashion, seemingly being depicted as a supervillain again. His telepathy is also portrayed at being at a high point, as he is able to will the powerful [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] to turn back into young Billy Batson by forcing him to say "Shazam!"

The source of these actions are found in Hank's brain, where Palmer encounters [[Mr. Mind]], a Captain Marvel villain, who is feeding on Brainwave's growth. He finds it especially delicious, unlike regular humans. Palmer eventually gets past the worm and successfully incapacitates Brainwave. He is taken back with the [[Justice Society of America|JSA]] and left in the care of his mother [[Merry Pemberton]]. It is unknown when Brainwave became a host for Mr. Mind.<ref>{{Comic book reference|Story = Black Reign|Title = JSA|Issue = #56-58|Date = March through April 2004|Publisher = DC Comics}} and {{Comic book reference|Title = Hawkman|Volume = 4|Issue = #23-25|Date = March through April 2004|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>

Later, Brainwave was recruited by [[Doctor Fate]] to save [[Sandy Hawkins|Sand]] from [[The Dreaming (comics)|The Dreaming]]. In that mental plane, he was able to destroy Sand's brainwashing and return him to the waking realm.<ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = JSA|Issue = #63|Date = (September 2004)|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref> He has since given up his heroic identity and is currently in the country of Parador.

Henry Jr., like all his Infinity Inc. counterparts, briefly made an appearance during the DC ''[[Convergence (comics)|Convergence]]'' crossover. Powerless and trapped on Telos, he had continued his relationship with Jade, although they were estranged due to his alcoholism. After regaining his powers and taking on a Post-Crisis version of Jonah Hex, Henry and all of Infinity Inc. took over for the Justice Society on a seemingly-returned Earth-2.

Henry King Jr. has been portrayed differently over his many appearances, being heroic at first, appearing as a villain secondly, and with a third portrayal as a mixture of the two, but largely heroic.

==Powers and abilities==
Both King Sr. and Jr. have a variety of mental powers. King Sr. was originally much stronger, but upon his death, he somehow passed his powers on to his son, vastly increasing King Jr.'s power level.

Chief among their powers is telepathy. Both are able to dominate many minds at once and cause people to see illusions, or even have complete control over them. Proximity seems key to the effectiveness of this power, even though it had no defined range. King Jr. mentioned how even strong wills could not resist him when he was right next to them. While many telepaths filter out the thoughts of others, King Jr. allows the millions of minds he constantly comes across to flow freely through his mind.

Lesser-used powers of the Kings include telekinesis, the creation of realistic three-dimensional holograms, and the ability to fire blasts of psionic energy.

==Other versions==

When they were freed by John Constantine, they worked to get him back to Prime-Earth.<ref>''Earth 2: World's End'' #8.

Brainwave, Todd, and Jonni slew the men responsible and boarded the train.<ref>''Earth 2: World's End'' #10.
