 Yeah. No, I'm telling you, Tracy, it's the greatest thing ever. I'm getting all my Twitter and Instagram comments on paper, and the nasty mean stuff, all gets edited out. Yeah. And the coolest thing? Ever since I started using this service, all of my followers are actually way more stoked on me. So cool, right?  Am so! But I don't care. People just have to accept my body the way it is. <poem><i> If you do not like me, you are not allowed in my safe spaaaace.</i></poem> <poem><i>Oh no, not reality! Somebody stop him!</i></poem> Look around you. What do you see? People who are slim. Skinny. But not everyone can have nice bodies like them. Just imagine it. Putting your pictures up on Twitter just to have some people write comments about your weight. It happens, all too often. And so together, we have created #shamelessAmerica,  so no one is ever labeled... Oh my God. What have we done?
