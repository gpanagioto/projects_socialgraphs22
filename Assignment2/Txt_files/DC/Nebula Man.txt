'''Nebula Man''' is a fictional character in [[DC Comics]]. He first appeared in ''Justice League of America'' #100–101 ([[1972 in comics|1972]]).

Originally a villain responsible for the disappearance of the [[Seven Soldiers of Victory]], he has since reappeared as '''Neh-Buh-Loh''', the primary antagonist in the [[2005 in comics|2005]]–[[2006 in comics|2006]] mega-series ''[[Seven Soldiers]]'' by [[Grant Morrison]]. Before this reappearance Morrison built up the character's backstory, starting in [[1997 in comics|1997]] with more extensive appearances in ''JLA: Classified'' ([[2005 in comics|2005]]).

==Fictional character biography==
The Neh-Buh-Loh is in fact the adult version of a sentient universe called '''Qwewq'''. He first appeared as the Nebula Man in ''Justice League of America'' #100,<ref>{{cite comic |title=[[Justice League#Silver and Bronze Age / Justice League of America|Justice League of America]] |volume= |issue=#100 |story=The Unknown Soldier of Victory! |writer=[[Len Wein|Wein, Len]] |penciller=[[Dick Dillin|Dillin, Dick]] |inker=[[Joe Giella|Giella, Joe]] |date=August 1972 |publisher=[[DC Comics]] |location=[[New York City|New York, NY]]}}</ref> described as a cosmic being "whose touch has the power of 20 atomic bombs". He was supposedly created by a villain known as The Hand to defeat the original Seven Soldiers of Victory (a later [[retcon]] would give him his current origin, with The Hand's involvement being more incidental). He battled the Soldiers in Tibet. His actions scattered the Soldiers through time, a fate from which they were later saved by the [[Justice League]] and [[Justice Society]]. The Nebula Man was defeated when the sidekick of the [[Crimson Avenger]], [[Wing (DC Comics)|Wing]], sacrificed himself to deliver the final blow with a cosmic device; Wing was buried in Tibet by monks who witnessed his death. 

During the JLA storyline "Rock of Ages", the Flash, Aquaman, and Green Lantern are sent by [[Metron (comics)|Metron]] through time and space and they land on Wonderworld. During a brief tour of Wonderworld's Omnitropolis and its museum district by that world's [[Atom (comics)|Atom]] analogue Mote, a few peculiar items are mentioned. Amongst them are an evil 5 dimensional imp trapped in a 6 dimensional bottle, a speedster Glimmer's treadmill, and a larval universe they call Qwewq. They say that they are feeding it and hope to allow it to grow to its full potential.<ref>{{cite comic |title=[[Justice League#JLA|JLA]] |volume=|issue=#12 |story=Rock Of Ages – Part Three: Wonderworld |writer=[[Grant Morrison|Morrison, Grant]] |penciller=[[Howard Porter (artist)|Porter, Howard]] |inker=Dell, John |date=November 1997}} Collected in {{cite book |title=Rock of Ages |year=1998 |isbn=1-56389-416-5 |publisher=[[DC Comics]] |location=[[New York City|New York, NY]]}}</ref>

The Nebula Man appeared once more in ''[[Stars and S.T.R.I.P.E.]]'',<ref>{{cite comic |title=Stars and S.T.R.I.P.E. |volume=1 |issue=8 |story=Crisis in Blue Valley |writer=[[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]] |penciller=Moder, Lee |inker=Davis, Dan |date=March 2000 |publisher=[[DC Comics]] |location=[[New York City|New York, NY]]}}</ref> before reappearing in ''JLA: Classified'' #1–3, working with [[Gorilla Grodd]] and announcing the end of the world. At the same time, the Justice League were in the Infant Universe of Qwewq, unaware that this was Neh-Buh-Loh's larval form.<ref>{{cite comic |title=[[Justice League#JLA: Classified|JLA: Classified]] |issue=#1–3 |writer=[[Grant Morrison|Morrison, Grant]] |penciller=[[Ed McGuinness|McGuinness, Ed]] |inker=[[Dexter Vines|Vines, Dexter]] |date=January–March 2005 |publisher=[[DC Comics]] |location=[[New York City|New York, NY]]}} Collected in {{cite book |title=[[Ultramarine Corps|JLA: Ultramarine Corps]] |date=October 2007 |isbn=1-4012-1564-5 |publisher=[[DC Comics]] |location=[[New York City|New York, NY]]}}</ref>

In the ''Seven Soldiers'' series, Neh-Buh-Loh was revealed to be allied with (or perhaps created by) the [[Sheeda]], time travelling predators from the end of time. He served as the personal huntsman of the Sheeda Queen [[Sheeda#Sheeda characters|Gloriana Tenebrae]]. In the past, Neh-Buh-Loh had been sent to slay the queen's innocent stepdaughter Rhiannon (a.k.a. Misty Kilgore). However, moved by her beauty and symmetry, he could not bear to do it and allowed the girl to escape. This was Neh-Buh-Loh's secret shame for many years.

It was further explained that in the 1940s, Neh-Buh-Loh had been summoned (rather than created) by The Hand using a sonic horn. The creature was seeking "seven soldiers" who were prophesied to one day defeat his mistress, Gloriana. The Hand was all too eager to point him in the right direction, thus leading to the original Seven Soldiers becoming lost in time.

This same sonic horn was used by The Hand's nephew Boy Blue to once again summon Neh-Buh-Loh and the Sheeda in the present, leading to the destruction of an ''ad hoc'' Seven Soldiers team created by the original [[Greg Saunders|Vigilante]]. This set the stage for the Harrowing of Earth which the heroes of the ''Seven Soldiers'' series attempted to prevent.

Neh-Buh-Loh was finally defeated by [[Frankenstein (DC Comics)|Frankenstein]], who capitalized on a flaw placed in him as an infant by the [[Ultramarine Corps]], a team of heroes who had entered Qwewq seeking redemption.<ref>{{cite comic |title=Seven Soldiers: Frankenstein |issue=#5 |writer=[[Grant Morrison|Morrison, Grant]] |artist=[[Doug Mahnke|Mahnke, Doug]] |date=May 2006 |publisher=[[DC Comics]] |location=[[New York City|New York, NY]]}}</ref>

==Allusions==
The use of Neh-Buh-Loh in ''Seven Soldiers'' is influenced by several characters in myth and legend. His failed mission to kill his queen's lovely stepdaughter<ref>{{cite comic |title=Seven Soldiers: Zatanna |issue=#3 |writer=[[Grant Morrison|Morrison, Grant]] |penciller=[[Ryan Sook|Sook, Ryan]] |inker=Gray, Mick |date=September 2005 |publisher=[[DC Comics]] |location=[[New York City|New York, NY]]}}</ref> is a direct parallel with the [[fairy tale]] of [[Snow White]]. 

In addition, his role as the horned Huntsman of the Sheeda has elements of characters from [[Celtic mythology]] such as the horned god [[Cernunnos]] and later legends such as the King of the [[Wild Hunt]] and [[Herne the Hunter]].

==Other versions==
In ''[[All-Star Superman]]'' #10, Superman uses the infant universe of Qwewq to create an Earth without a Superman that he dubs Earth Q.
