All right! Did you get to any dirty parts yet?  I don't get it dude. W-what's so controversial about this? All he's done is said "shit" and "fuck" a few times. Why would anyone think this book so obscene or dangerous? Hey yeah, we should write our own banned book.   Guys, guys! We are totally fucked! The book is gone from my dresser drawer! My parents must have found it! Hey hey! I'm not taking the heat for this alone! We all wrote it! If I'm going down, somebody has to go down with me! Well dude, somebody has got to go down! Butters, listen: you are in big trouble! Okay, well... a-actually it was all written by... Butters.  Hey, wait a minute, that's ours! What? Hey!  Yeah, but that was when we thought we were gonna get in trouble, asshole!  God-damnit! More and more of us are against this book every day! The author is cruel and offensive! And for these reasons, we demand this book be banned from all school, stores, and libraries! This book is nothing but smut and vulgarity purely for the sake of smut and vulgarity! Goddamnit there is no deeper meaning in this book! Read it again! What? Dude, that is not in the book at all! What? There's nothing about liberals or conservatives! I can't believe they won't ban our book! Shut up, Cartman! Just face it. We lost this one.  So dude, if Butters wrote a second book, then everyone's gonna know he couldn't have written the first one!  You can't be serious! You people like this?! God-damnit, will you people stop reading into stuff that isn't there!! They're saying they're gonna ban both your books now, completely. You're not making any more money! Yeah, dude, eh, that's why we all need to avoid books and stick to television.
