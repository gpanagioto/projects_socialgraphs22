 Sweetheart, can we get going, please? Honey, the pumpkin patch opened like an hour ago and 'member how I was saying I want to get there early?  Great, perfect. Let's go to the pumpkin patch. Wha-what?  The spider's great.  Why does she do this every time?  I said it's time. Boy, look at the time.  'Kay, here we go, going to the pumpkin patch. You don't need glitter lip gloss! No! No, we don't need to talk! Ah, I'm super happy! Cool, you got to pee again. Awesome. Okay, come on, let's go.   Awesome. Here we go, heading out now! No! Pumpkin patch is gonna, eh- See, all the best pumpkins get taken and then eh- Okay, come on! Here we go, going out the door! Go, Mom!  'Kay, here we go to the pumpkin patch!  Oh my fucking God! Arrrrrrrrgh! Yeah, we are just getting here. The petting zoo's cl- The petting zoo's closed? What do you mean?! I just got here! No! I missed it! I missed it all!   What? Yes. You're right, guys. It's my only way out. Hey guys, I think I got it figured out. Okay, first of all, we need a scary place to lure her into. What is the creepiest place in town? Ross Dress for Less, that's right. Stan and Kyle will wait inside the Ross Dress for Less, and I will bring Heidi there. Once inside, Kenny and Butters will set off a series of explosions that will- This is how we're going to get rid of Heidi. You guys said you would help me get rid of her! Who cares about a witch?! My life is a living hell, you guys! I've tried! It's impossible! You don't understand! She has no time-management skills whatsoever! You don't know 'cause you've never had a girlfriend, Kyle!  Hey, babe. Listen uh, there's a big fun costume party tonight and I was thinking you and me should go. What do you say? Yeah, I just think, you know, we need to let off some steam and have a little Halloween fun, you know? I already have our costumes picked out. Cool. I'll pick you up at 5.  Don't worry, Heidi. This is the fastest way to the party.  I'm sure the witch won't even notice us. Well, Heidi, if we'd been on time, we wouldn't need to take a short cut. But I wanted to give you your space to get ready. Why would I be mad? You wanted to make sure you looked right, and then you had to eat and use the bathroom 40 times. I can't blame you for missing the pumpkin patch.  Sweet. Come on, come on. Yes, it just came out of nowhere. I tried to save Heidi, but it was too late. She was dressed kind of like me, but had a simple Munich dirndl from Germany. Excuse me?! Are you actually trying to blame the victim here?! Ohhhhh! I will have your badge, sir!  It's gonna be a while.  Yeah, no. I've been ready for a couple hours now.
