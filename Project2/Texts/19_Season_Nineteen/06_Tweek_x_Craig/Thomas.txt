  Oh God!...  Money? What did I do wrong, huh? Everyone's so damned happy, but... but why did this have to happen to my son?! What did I do to make my son like this? Oh, what? You know about this? What? Why can't you quit him?   I can see how much they're both hurting, but... Can't you understand that in my time we just didn't accept this?  Then again, he's my son no matter what. I can't just shut down on him.
