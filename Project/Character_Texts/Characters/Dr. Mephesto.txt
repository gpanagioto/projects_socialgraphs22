 in our evolution. If I can unfreeze the body, and perform an autopsy, I could learn much about this creature's people and its time. Thank you, Mayor. Oh, and boys, I, I can't give you a reward for finding this creature, but if you'd like, I'll let you name him. Steve it is. Come on, Steve. We've got work to do.  Unfreezing this body will be quite delicate work. We'll have to use the most advanced methods available. This is very exciting. He could be a Neanderthal. Or an Australopithecus from the Paleolithic era.  This is incredible! Think of all we can learn from this body! All that it can teach us! Let's just hope the press doesn't get wind of this right away. Ladies and gentlemen, we still have a lot of work to do.  Yes, it's true, although at this early stage we know very little about this man or the time from which he comes. That's it, Kevin. Now we can begin the autopsy. Ugh? What's this? That's impossible!  Do an EKG on him! My God, he really ''is'' alive. The ice must have preserved him! No no, we've got to think this through.  Mayor, this man has not been conscious for almost three years. He won't understand what he sees! He'll be frightened and confused! Perhaps death is better than the shock he will take trying to adapt to our time.  Oh my God. It looks as if he's about to speak! What? You're, you're hungry? You're, you're hungry? Me friend. Friieend. Me friend. Ma-phes-to. Mah-phehs-to. Hawgh! If we could understand what he's saying, then maybe we could get some answers.  If only there was someone who could communicate with him on a level as primitive as his own, a mind like... a ''child''. Steve. You- Steeve. Steeeve. Steeeve.  Oh good, you're here. Yes, and I need you to communicate with him. See if you can understand what he's saying.  What'd he say? Very interesting. What?? Tell him, tell him he's... home. In the year 1999. He's been frozen for the last 32 months. And we found you- All right, all right, all- All right, all right, calm down. I think that's enough for today.  The same. That's right. Oh? Where are you gents from? Well, there's not a lot to see, but... Come in.  but we've made great progress now that he's in the habitat.  Yes. Kevin and I designed a habitat for Steve to live in that is completely like his own world. Everything is 1996-oriented. Yes, well, Kevin has done a lot of work in figuring out just how related to us Steve really is. He came up with this drawing: How would we do ''that''? As you can see, the ice man is listening to Ace of Base, which was a very popular group during his era, and primitive drumming soothed his people's tempers. Ah! Here we see the ice man trying to gain Internet access on the computer. The Internet was still not very big in his time, so the Web frightens and confuses him.  And now the ice man watches television.  Wait. This could be dangerous. He's fine, boys. And we're learning ''so much'' from him. He's gone! The ice man has broken out! He must have used this... door. We have to find him! He won't survive long out in the world! No, what did you say? Uh, use him for what? I have no idea! Was the ice man here? He can't function out here in our time! Is it him? Does he always do this?  Have you seen a man who looks similar to us, but with a thicker brow and an apish nose? An ice man, a man from the past. We must find him. Now, where is he?!  Where is he? Where is Steve?! We've got to stop it! He has to be around here somewhere. No! Come back! You can't get out! You'll never live!  What?! 
 Yes, puberty is a very wonderful thing, Stan. It's what links us all together, makes us one. Never went through puberty? Who never went through puberty? Your father never went through puberty? Oh, I can't say that I blame him. Well, I should think the most logical solution would be... hormones. Yes!  Here, and tell your father to take just one of these pills every week. It could be just what he needs. And be sure to tell him that his secret is safe with me. My pleasure. I just love helping people. 
I've done it, Kevin. I've successfully spliced this chipmunk with a piece of provolone cheese.  Why, it's little Eric Cartman. Well of course, come in.  Oh, Eric, I'm afraid it's not that simple. Genetic engineering has not yet evolved to the state where I can just make people. Oh. Well, I happen to be a member of an organization that can help you. It's called, NAMBLA. Yes. I have been a member for several years. I'm sure they'd let you join. You l-look about right. Sure! 
There there, my little mouse friend. Soon you will have more asses than you ever dreamed of.  Yes? What do you want? Oh I'm... terribly sorry, but I don't let strangers in. There's a gas station about half a mile down the road. They have a phone there. No, please, it isn't that at all. No wait, I'm sorry, you're right you're right, we do have a black president. Please, come in.  WAAH! Eric Cartman? Eric, your father never wanted this to happen. He was protecting you as well as them. Eric, you have to understand, it's all very complicated.  Very well. Oh for crying out loud, now everyone is letting themselves in!  Oh, all right. It's a complicated story. I just can't tell him quickly. Yes? Yeah, right, let me guess: You're an African-American. Beat it I'm not helpin' you! No no, you don't understand. Alright, alright, jeez.  What's going on? You got what you wanted, gingers, so let us go. It's true... Jack Tenorman was your father.
