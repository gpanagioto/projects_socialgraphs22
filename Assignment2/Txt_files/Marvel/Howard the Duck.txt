'''Howard the Duck''' is a [[fiction]]al [[Character (arts)|character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character was created by writer [[Steve Gerber]] and artist [[Val Mayerik]]. Howard the Duck first appeared in ''[[Adventure into Fear]]'' #19 ([[cover-date]]d Dec. 1973) and several subsequent series have chronicled the misadventures of the ill-tempered [[talking animals in fiction|anthropomorphic animal]] trapped on a human-dominated Earth. Echoing this, the most common tagline of his comics reads 'Trapped In a World He Never Made!'

Howard's adventures are generally social [[satire]]s, while a few are [[parody|parodies]] of [[genre fiction]] with a [[metafiction]]al awareness of the medium. The book is [[existentialist]], and its main joke, according to Gerber, is that there is no joke: "...&nbsp;that life's most serious moments and most incredibly dumb moments are often distinguishable only by a momentary point of view."<ref name=mediascene /> [[Gloria Katz]], producer of the notorious, ill-fated [[Howard the Duck (film)|1986 movie adaptation]] of the comic, expressed a diametrically opposed opinion of the character, "It's a film about a duck from outer space ... It's not supposed to be an existential experience."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comicsbulletin.com/foom/126874125950897.htm |title=F.O.O.M.

Howard the Duck was portrayed by Ed Gale and voiced by [[Chip Zien]] in the critically and commercially unsuccessful 1986 [[Howard the Duck (film)|self-titled film]]. Starting in 2014, [[Howard the Duck (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|the character]], voiced by [[Seth Green]], appeared in cameos in several [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) films, the [[Disney XD]] animated series ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (TV series)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' (2015–19) and ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' (2016; with [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]), and the [[Disney+]] series ''[[What If...? (TV series)|What If...?]]'' (2021).

Gerber wrote 27 issues of the series (for the most part ditching the horror parodies), illustrated by a variety of artists, beginning with [[Frank Brunner]]. For Gerber, Howard was a flesh-and-blood duck and explained that "If [[Wile E. Coyote]] gets run over by a steamroller, the result is a pancake-flat coyote who can be expected to snap back to three dimensions within moments; if Howard gets run over by a steamroller, the result is blood on asphalt."<ref name="mediascene">{{cite journal|title = Where are the jokes?

Sporting the slogan "Get Down, America!", the All-Night Party was a fictional political party that appeared in Gerber's ''Howard the Duck'' series during the U.S. [[United States Presidential election, 1976|Presidential campaign of 1976]],<ref>Sanderson "1970s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 177: "Howard the Duck ended up being nominated as [a] presidential candidate!"</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Saavedra|first=Scott|date=August 2020 |title=Cartoon Characters for President|journal=RetroFan|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]] |location=United States|issue=10|page=13}}</ref> and led to Howard the Duck allegedly receiving thousands of write-in votes in the actual election.<ref>{{cite book |last=Daniels |first=Les |author-link=Les Daniels |title=Marvel: Five Fabulous Decades of the World's Greatest Comics |publisher =[[Abrams Books|Harry N.

Marvel attempted a [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] with a short-lived ''Howard the Duck'' newspaper [[comic strip]] from 1977 to 1978, at first written by Gerber and drawn by Colan and Mayerik,<ref name="CBAC3">{{cite book|last = Cooke|first = Jon B.|chapter=Steve Gerber's Crazy Days|title = Comic Book Artist Collection, Vol. 3|publisher= TwoMorrows Publishing|date = April 2005|location= Raleigh, North Carolina|page = 66|chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=F9bAN1DE7igC&q=newspapers+that+carried+the+howard+the+duck+comic+strip&pg=PA66 |isbn = 978-1893905429}}</ref> later written by [[Marv Wolfman]] and drawn by [[Alan Kupperberg]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lambiek.net/artists/k/kupperberg_a.htm |title=Alan Kupperberg |date=May 29, 2009 |publisher=[[Lambiek|Lambiek Comiclopedia]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024074916/http://www.lambiek.net/artists/k/kupperberg_a.htm |archive-date=October 24, 2012 |url-status=live |access-date=February 2, 2013 |quote=In 1978 he took over the ''Howard the Duck'' weekly comic with Marv Wolfman. }}</ref>

Gerber gained a degree of creative autonomy when he became the comic series' editor in addition to his usual writing duties. With issue #16, unable to meet the deadline for his regular script, Gerber substituted an entire issue of text pieces and illustrations satirizing his own difficulties as a writer.<ref>{{cite web |title=Howard the Duck #16 [30¢] |url=http://www.comics.org/issue/31464/ |website=Grand Comics Database |access-date=13 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201102154040/https://www.comics.org/issue/31464/ |archive-date=2 November 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>

[[The Walt Disney Company]] contacted Marvel in 1977 over concerns that the visual design of Howard infringed on their trademark for [[Donald Duck]]. Marvel agreed to a redesign of the character by Disney artists. A key feature of the redesign was that the character would wear pants.<ref name=Grant>{{cite journal|last = Grant|first = Steven|title = How Howard Got His Pants|journal= Howard the Duck Magazine|issue = #8|pages = 24–28|publisher = [[Marvel Comics Group]]|date = November 1980|location= New York, New York<!--location in 1978-->}}</ref>

In 1978, Gerber was removed from the newspaper strip and the comic-book series due to chronic problems with deadlines.<ref name=tcj41p7>{{cite journal|title = Marvel Fires Gerber|journal= The Comics Journal|issue = #41|page = 7|publisher = [[Fantagraphics Books]]|date = August 1978|location= Stamford, Connecticut<!--location in 1978-->}}</ref> His final issue of the comic-book series was #27 (September 1978). The series continued for four more issues with stories by [[Marv Wolfman]], [[Mary Skrenes]], [[Mark Evanier]], and [[Bill Mantlo]].

The final episode of the newspaper strip was published on October 29, 1978. Issue #31 (May 1979) of the comic-book series announced on its letters page that it would be the final issue of ''Howard the Duck'' as a color comic. Marvel then relaunched the series that year as a bimonthly magazine, with scripts by Mantlo, art by Colan and [[Michael Golden (comics)|Michael Golden]] and unrelated backup features by others. The magazine was canceled after nine issues.

On August 29, 1980, after learning of Marvel's efforts to license Howard for use in film and broadcast media, Steve Gerber filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against Marvel corporate parent [[Cadence Industries]] and other parties, alleging that he was the sole owner of the character.<ref name="Martin">{{cite web |url= http://www.hoodedutilitarian.com/2014/05/all-quacked-up-steve-gerber-marvel-comics-and-howard-the-duck/ |title= All Quacked-Up: Steve Gerber, Marvel Comics, and Howard the Duck|first= Robert Stanley|last= Martin|date= May 28, 2014|publisher= HoodedUtilitarian.com|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140529143308/http://www.hoodedutilitarian.com/2014/05/all-quacked-up-steve-gerber-marvel-comics-and-howard-the-duck/|archive-date= May 29, 2014|url-status= dead|access-date= June 2, 2014}}</ref><ref name=HTDdocuments>{{cite web | url = http://www.hoodedutilitarian.com/2014/05/the-howard-the-duck-documents/|title=The Howard the Duck Documents| publisher=HoodedUtilitarian.com|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140529145709/http://www.hoodedutilitarian.com/2014/05/the-howard-the-duck-documents/|archive-date= May 29, 2014}}</ref> This was one of the first <!-- The Siegel and Shuster legal battle with DC Comics in the 1970s predates Gerber's battle with Marvel -->highly publicized [[creator's rights]] cases in American comics, and attracted support from major industry figures, some of whom created homage/parody stories with Gerber to fund a lawsuit against Marvel; these included ''[[Destroyer Duck]]'' with [[Jack Kirby]].<ref name="DAK38"/> The lawsuit was settled on September 24, 1982, with Gerber acknowledging that his work on the character was done as [[work-for-hire]] and that Marvel parent Cadence Industries owned "all right, title and interest" to Howard the Duck and the Howard material he had produced. On November 5, 1982, Judge [[David Vreeland Kenyon|David Kenyon]] approved the motion and dismissed the case.<ref name="Martin"/><ref name=HTDdocuments /><ref name="DAK38"/>

The only new story featuring the character between 1981 and 1986 appeared in ''[[Bizarre Adventures]]'' #34 (1983) Scripted by [[Steven Grant]], it featured a suicidal Howard being put through a parody of ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]''.

The original comic book series reappeared with issue #32 (January 1986). It featured a story that had been written by Grant four years earlier.<ref name="DAK38">{{cite news | author = Zimmerman, Dwight Jon | date = September 1986 | title = Steve Gerber (part 2) | work = [[Comics Interview]] | issue = 38 | pages = 6–19 | publisher = [[Fictioneer Books]]}}</ref>  Steve Gerber had submitted a script for the issue, but withdrew it after it had been revised to conform to editorial guidelines.<ref name="Martin" /><ref name=HTDdocuments>{{cite web | url = http://www.hoodedutilitarian.com/2014/05/the-howard-the-duck-documents/|title=The Howard the Duck Documents| publisher=HoodedUtilitarian.com|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140529145709/http://www.hoodedutilitarian.com/2014/05/the-howard-the-duck-documents/|archive-date= May 29, 2014}}</ref> Issue #33 (October 1986), scripted by Christopher Stager, featured a parody of the film ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]''. Howard co-creator Val Mayerik co-plotted the story and provided the art. It was released alongside an adaptation of the ''[[Howard the Duck (film)|Howard the Duck]]'' feature film, which was published in ''[[Marvel Super Special]]'' #41 (November 1986) and a three-issue comic-book series.

Gerber returned to Howard in 1989 in ''The Sensational She-Hulk'' #14–17. The character was again living with Beverly Switzler, now working as a rent-a-[[ninja]]. How they got back together was never explained. Beverly was not involved in the story, in which She-Hulk takes Howard on a trip through several dimensions with a theoretical physicist from Empire State University.

Gerber's next story featuring Howard appeared in ''[[Spider-Man Team-Up]]'' #5 (December 1996), around the same time he was writing a "[[Savage Dragon]]/Destroyer Duck" crossover for Image. He had the idea to create an unofficial crossover between the two issues, where the characters would meet momentarily in the shadows, but which would not affect either story. Soon after, Gerber discovered that Howard was scheduled to appear in ''[[Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch)|Ghost Rider]]'' vol. 3, #81 (Jan. 1997) alongside [[Devil Dinosaur]] and [[Moon Boy]], and issues of ''[[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]],'' as well as the three issue ''[[Daydreamers (comics)|Daydreamers]]'' miniseries by [[J.M. DeMatteis]]. Gerber was not pleased with this development, and changed the "unofficial crossover" somewhat.<ref name="Gerber2007">{{cite web |url=  http://www.stevegerber.com/sgblog/2007/01/17/and-it%e2%80%99s-not-like-you%e2%80%99re-going-to-read-about-it-on-the-steve-gerber-web-site/|title= …and it's not like you're going to read about it on the Steve Gerber Web site|first= Steve|last= Gerber|date= January 17, 2007|publisher= SteveGerberBlog|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071013040916/http://www.stevegerber.com/sgblog/2007/01/17/and-it%E2%80%99s-not-like-you%E2%80%99re-going-to-read-about-it-on-the-steve-gerber-web-site/|archive-date=October 13, 2007 |url-status= dead|access-date= February 3, 2013}}</ref>

In ''Spider-Man Team-Up'' #5, [[Spider-Man]], Beverly and Howard meet the [[Elf with a Gun]] and two shadowy figures (presumed to be Savage Dragon and Destroyer Duck) in a darkened warehouse, grab a disc, then leave shortly afterwards. But in the ''Savage Dragon/Destroyer Duck'' crossover comic, Elf with a Gun creates thousands of clones of Howard and Beverly during a fierce battle. As Savage Dragon and Destroyer Duck escape the warehouse, they reveal that they rescued the "real" Howard and Beverly, while Spider-Man left with two of the clones. Howard has his feathers dyed green, and is renamed "Leonard the Duck", and Beverly has her hair dyed black and is renamed "Rhonda Martini". Leonard later had a cameo appearance in ''Savage Dragon'' #41, and Leonard and Rhonda have a single-panel cameo when they meet Gerber's [[Nevada (comics)|Nevada]] in [[Vertigo Comics]]' ''Winter's Edge'' #2.

In 2001, when Marvel launched its [[MAX (comics)|MAX]] imprint of "mature readers" comics, Gerber returned to write a six-issue ''Howard the Duck'' [[miniseries]] illustrated by [[Phil Winslade]] and Glenn Fabry. Featuring several familiar ''Howard the Duck'' characters, the series, like the original one, parodied a wide range of other comics and pop culture figures, but with considerably stronger language and sexual content than what would have been allowable 25 years earlier. The series has [[Doctor Bong]] causing Howard to go through multiple changes of form, principally into a mouse (as a parody of [[Mickey Mouse]], in retaliation for the Disney-mandated redesign), and entering a chain of events parodying comics such as ''[[Witchblade]]'', ''[[Preacher (comics)|Preacher]]'' and several others, with Howard ultimately having a conversation with God in Hell.

Howard had cameo appearances in ''She-Hulk'' (vol. 2) #9 in February 2005 and in ''She-Hulk'' vol. 3 #3/#100 in February 2006 (issue #3 was also the numbered as the 100th total issue of all the various She-Hulk series). In 2007, he returned in ''Howard the Duck'' vol. 4 #1-4, a miniseries by writer [[Ty Templeton]] and artist [[Juan Bobillo]]. This series was rated for ages 9 and up, though one issue was published with a ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'' tie-in cover with a parental advisory claim.

In November 2014, Marvel announced an ongoing series starting in March 2015 featuring Howard as a [[private investigator]] on Earth. The creative team consisted of writer [[Chip Zdarsky]] and artist Joe Quinones.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.newsarama.com/22800-marvel-s-howard-the-duck-to-get-new-ongoing-series.html|title= Marvel's ''Howard the Duck'' To Get New Ongoing Series|first= Lucas|last= Siegel|date= November 21, 2014|publisher= [[Newsarama]]|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141123205654/http://www.newsarama.com/22800-marvel-s-howard-the-duck-to-get-new-ongoing-series.html|archive-date= November 23, 2014|url-status= live}}</ref>  ''Howard the Duck'' (vol. 5) ran for 5 issues before Marvel relaunched many of their existing titles with the [[All-New, All-Different Marvel]] line of comics.  This led to a reboot produced by the same creative team starting with ''Howard the Duck'' (vol. 6) #1 in November 2015.<ref>James Whitbrook (2015-06-29).

After escaping back to New York and being restored to his natural form, Howard is hired as a dishwasher by Beverly's uncle, Lee Switzler.

Writer Bill Mantlo, beginning with issue #30, returned the series to its former status quo, bringing Beverly back into the picture and having her divorce Doctor Bong. Howard's creator Steve Gerber, who left the series after issue #27, originally intended for Beverly and Bong's marriage to be lasting and for Beverly to be written out of the series from that point on. Howard and Beverly's friend Paul, who had ended up in a coma after he had previously been shot by the Ringmaster, awakens from his coma and is released from the hospital. Beverly's uncle Lee brings everyone back to Cleveland and employs Howard as a cab driver, while Paul, back to being a somnambulist after his release from the hospital, becomes Winda's boyfriend. Howard dons a suit of "Iron Duck" armor made by Claude Starkowitz, a man who has delusions of being related to Tony Stark and dreams of being the personal armorer to [[Iron Man]], and battles Doctor Bong in the final issue of the original 70s ''Howard the Duck'' series (issue #31).<ref name="HtD30">{{cite comic| writer= [[Bill Mantlo|Mantlo, Bill]]|penciller= Colan, Gene|inker= [[Al Milgrom|Milgrom, Al]]|story= If This Be Bongsday!|title= Howard the Duck|issue= #30|date= March 1979}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Mantlo, Bill|penciller= Colan, Gene|inker= Milgrom, Al|story= The Final Bong!|title= Howard the Duck|issue= #31|date= May 1979}}</ref> Howard later encounters [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]]<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Mantlo, Bill|penciller= [[Michael Golden (comics)|Golden, Michael]]|inker= [[Bob McLeod (comics)|McLeod, Bob]]|story= The Tomb of Drakula!|title= Howard the Duck|volume= 2|issue= #5|date= May 1980}}</ref> and even once returns to Duckworld.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Mantlo, Bill|penciller= Golden, Michael|inker= McLeod, Bob|story= Duckworld|title= Howard the Duck|volume= 2|issue= #6|date= July 1980}}</ref> At the end of the nine-issue magazine series, Howard leaves Beverly (at her request) and is later offered a genetically-constructed female duck mate, whom he does not take to.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Christopher Stager|Stager, Christopher]]|penciller= Mayerik, Val|inker= Mayerik, Val|story= Material Duck|title= Howard the Duck|issue= #33|date= September 1986}}</ref>

In an encounter with [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] and [[Ben Reilly]] (the then-current Spider-Man), Howard gets a rematch with the [[Circus of Crime]] and the Circus is defeated. During the fight, Howard and Beverly get stuck in a warehouse full of anthropomorphic ducks, briefly meeting the [[Savage Dragon]] and [[Destroyer Duck]]. Parker and Reilly leave the warehouse believing that they have the correct versions of Howard and Beverly with them. However, in the Savage Dragon/Destroyer Duck companion story that takes place simultaneously and that was written by Gerber, it is explained that the version of Howard and Beverly that left the warehouse with Parker and Reilly are simply clones taken by mistake and that the real Howard and Beverly actually left the scene with Savage Dragon and Destroyer Duck  .<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Darick Robertson|Robertson, Darick]]|penciller= Robertson, Darick|inker= [[Jerome K.

Years later, back with Beverly, he undergoes further shapeshifting experiences after an accident at a chemical facility of Doctor Bong's. Beverly is hired by Bong's Globally Branded Content Corporation, which manufactures boy bands from protein vats based on the sexual arousal of a focus group of gay men. Attempting to destroy an escapee whom Beverly has taken in, Bong inadvertently knocks Howard into a vat, which changes him, unstably, into a rat.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Gerber, Steve|penciller= [[Phil Winslade|Winslade, Phil]]|inker= Winslade, Phil|story= Making the Band|title= Howard the Duck|volume= 3|issue= #1|date= March 2002}}</ref> When Howard later showers, he changes his form multiple times before again permanently returning to the form of the giant rat.

Suzy is the inheritor of the [[douche]]blade, which starts to take her over when she wears an enchanted bracelet. In a skirmish, the bracelet is caught by Howard causing him to be the wielder of the doucheblade.

Arriving at the Boarding House of Mystery, Howard and Beverly encounter [[Cain and Abel]], the latter with a rock stuck in his head that allows him only moments of lucidity. There, they are granted their every wish, including Howard's return to his true form, and Beverly never being poor again, and meet parodies of [[John Constantine]], [[Wesley Dodds]], the [[Endless (comics)|Endless]], [[Spider Jerusalem]], and Gerber's own Nevada (called Utah), all characters from [[DC Comics]]' [[Vertigo (comics)|Vertigo]] [[Imprint (trade name)|imprint]].

Upon leaving the House of Mystery, Howard is once again transformed into an anthropomorphic mouse. It is revealed that Iprah has been merged with an experiment by the [[Archangel Gabriel|Angel Gabriel]] called Deuteronomy, intended to replace God, because God has been spending all his time in a bar in Hell since 1938. Deuteronomy is a creature half-id and half-superego, while Iprah is an all-ego promoter of self-indulgent pop psychology. Considering her dangerous, Gabriel sends the cherub Thrasher to resurrect Sigmund Freud, whose cigar blasts out half of Thrasher's brains (being immortal, this just makes him act drunk). Iprah destroys Freud, but Howard blasts her with the cigar, separating her from Deuteronomy. Puffing on the cigar, Howard disintegrates and arrives in Hell.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Gerber, Steve|penciller= Winslade, Phil|inker= Winslade, Phil|story= gone to ohio|title= Howard the Duck|volume= 3|issue= #5|date= July 2002}}</ref> He is eventually freed by Yah, a being who claims to be "God".<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Gerber, Steve|penciller= Winslade, Phil|inker= Winslade, Phil|story= creator's rights|title= Howard the Duck|volume= 3|issue= #6|date= August 2002}}</ref>

Howard returns to his business as a private eye, working in the same building as She-Hulk, in Brooklyn. One of his first new clients is Jonathan Richards, who hires Howard to retrieve a necklace stolen by the Black Cat. With the help of Tara Tam, his new friend and assistant, Howard manages to recover the necklace. However, on his way to give it back to Richards, he finds himself kidnapped by the Collector and allied with the Guardians of the Galaxy to escape the villain, who was attempting to add Howard to his collection of rare space objects and entities. Upon returning to Earth, Howard is robbed by [[Aunt May|May Parker]], Spider-Man's aunt, and later re-encounters the Ringmaster, who is revealed to have brainwashed the elderly into committing robberies. After recovering the necklace for a third time, Howard is approached by Richards in the middle of his fight against the Ringmaster and Richards reveals himself to be Talos the Untamed, who reveals that the necklace was part of a marginally powerful item known as the Abundant Glove. With help from Doctor Strange, Howard and Tara locate the final piece of the Abundant Glove, but are unable to put it back together when Talos grabs it and proceeds to use it to wreak havoc on the city. Talos is confronted by numerous heroes while Howard and Tara take cover. Howard is able to point out that Tara, who is revealed to possess shapeshifting powers similar to that of a Skrull, could help him defeat Talos. Tara used her powers to impersonate Skrull Emperor Kl'rt (the [[Super-Skrull]]), distracting Talos long enough for Howard to snatch the Abundant Glove from his hand.

On one occasion, Howard used a suit of powered armor known as the "Iron Duck" armor designed by Claude Starkowitz. Besides its property as body armor, the suit was equipped with foot-mounted leaping coils, a chest-mounted searchlight, and flamethrowers in both arms.<ref name="HtD30" />

==Characteristics and associations==
{{Original research|section|date=August 2010}}
Howard the Duck is a three-foot-tall [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] [[duck]]. He generally wears a tie and shirt and is almost always found smoking a [[cigar]]. Originally, like many cartoon ducks, he wore no pants; [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] threatened legal action due to Howard's resemblance to [[Donald Duck]],<ref>{{cite web |url= http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2007/09/20/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-121/|title= Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #121|first= Brian|last= Cronin|date= September 20, 2007|publisher= [[Comic Book Resources]]|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20121010192806/http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2007/09/20/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-121/|archive-date=October 10, 2012 |url-status= live |access-date= February 2, 2013|quote= Disney did, in fact, threaten to sue Marvel over the appearance of Howard the Duck}}</ref> and Marvel redesigned that aspect of the character by writing into the script that Howard was the target of anti-nudity protests, and was forced to do business with "Wally Sidney", a failed cartoonist who made his fortune through a chain of conservative clothing retailers known as "Sidney World". Howard tries on various outfits, including ones akin to Donald Duck's sailor uniform and [[Uncle Scrooge]]'s coat and [[top hat]], before settling on his new attire of a business suit complete with trousers. Although Howard sulks that he has lost, Beverly reassures him that she does not want him to be a victim of a mob, and loves him no matter what he wears.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Mantlo, Bill|penciller= Colan, Gene|inker= Janson, Klaus|story= Animal Indecency!|title= Howard the Duck|volume= 2|issue= #2|date= December 1979}}</ref>

Howard has an irritable and cynical attitude towards the often bizarre events around him; he feels there is nothing special about him except that he is a duck, and though he has no goals other than seeking comfort and to be left alone, he is often dragged into dangerous adventures simply because he is visibly unusual. His series' tagline, "Trapped in a world he never made", played off the [[genre]] trappings of 1950s [[science fiction]].

His near-constant companion and occasional girlfriend is former art model and [[Cleveland]] native Beverly Switzler. Like Howard, Beverly wants an ordinary life but is frequently singled out for her appearance, though as a beautiful woman rather than a duck. His other friends include Paul Same (a painter who briefly became a [[sleepwalking]] [[crime]]-fighter named the Winky Man), Winda Wester (a [[lisp (speech)|lisp]]ing ingénue with [[psychic]] powers), and [[country music]] singer Dreyfus Gultch. Howard has worked with [[Spider-Man]] and the [[Man-Thing]] on various occasions.

Howard found himself on Earth due to a shift in the "Cosmic Axis" from a world similar to Earth, but where there are "more ducks" and "apes don't talk." In the black-and-white ''Howard the Duck'' magazine series, writer [[Bill Mantlo]] theorized that Howard came from an extra-dimensional planet called Duckworld, a planet similar to Earth where ducks, not apes, had evolved to become the dominant species. In 2001, Gerber dismissed this idea, calling it "very pedestrian" and 'comic-booky' — in the worst sense of the term." Gerber stated that Howard came from an alternate Earth populated by a variety of anthropomorphic animals and not Duckworld.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.stevegerber.com/interviews/diamond.php3|title= Mad Genius, Angry Fowl|first= Nate|last= Shelton|date= November 2001|publisher= Diamond Previews Online|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120304034542/http://www.stevegerber.com/interviews/diamond.php3|archive-date=March 4, 2012 |url-status= live|access-date= April 6, 2007|quote= The title character was no super-hero; he was just a cantankerous little guy named Howard who was, in the words of his creator, "the living embodiment of all that is querulous, opinionated, and uncool"…and happened to hail from an alternate Earth populated by "funny" cartoon animals.}}</ref> A panel in ''Fear'' #19, prior to Howard's introduction, depicts Howard or someone like him near an anthropomorphic mouse and an anthropomorphic dog, in a panel about hypothetical other dimensions. Gerber later depicted his character [[Destroyer Duck]] as existing in such a world.

His antagonists (who usually appear in a single story each) are often parodies of [[science fiction]], [[fantasy]], or [[Horror fiction|horror]] characters, as well as frequent parodies of political figures and organizations. The chief recurring villain, Lester Verde, better known as [[Doctor Bong]] – modeled on [[Doctor Doom]] and writers [[Bob Greene]] and [[Lester Bangs]] – is a former [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] reporter who has the power to "reorder reality" by smashing himself on the [[bell (instrument)|bell]]-shaped helmet on his head and his main goal is to marry Beverly. Beverly eventually agreed to marry him to save Howard from Bong's evil experimentation, but the two were divorced shortly thereafter. Doctor Bong would reappear in issues of ''[[She-Hulk]]'' and ''[[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]]'' in the mid-1990s. Other recurring villains include the Kidney Lady, an older woman who has been convinced by her former lover that the soul is in the kidneys and attacks anything she sees as a threat to them, and Reverend Jun Moon Yuc and his Yuccies, a parody of Reverend [[Sun Myung Moon]] and the [[Unification Church]] ("Moonies"). Another important villain was the organization S.O.O.F.I. (Save Our Offspring From Indecency), whose leader was implied to be [[Anita Bryant]], though she looked like an old, fat [[Elvis Presley]] with a [[smiley|smiley face]]/[[orange (fruit)|orange]] on her head.

Other Marvel Comics characters occasionally appeared with Howard, including [[Spider-Man]], the [[Daimon Hellstrom|Son of Satan]] and the [[Ringmaster (comics)|Ringmaster]]. [[Omega the Unknown]] appeared to him in a dream, as did Spider-Man and the founding members of the rock group [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] on other occasions.

Seemingly an [[autodidact]], Howard at various times references [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], [[Albert Camus]] (whose novel ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]'' Gerber considers the principal influence on the comic series),<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.comicsbulletin.com/interviews/3845/steve-gerber-an-absurd-journey-part-i/|title= Steve Gerber: An Absurd Journey Part I |first= Darren|last= Schroeder|date= June 7, 2001|publisher= SilverBulletComicBooks.com|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20121130214049/http://comicsbulletin.com/interviews/3845/steve-gerber-an-absurd-journey-part-i/|archive-date=November 30, 2012 |url-status= dead|access-date= February 3, 2013|quote= I suppose that would be Albert Camus's ''The Stranger'', which I encountered my first or second year of college.

In a parody of the Marvel comic character [[Shang-Chi]], Howard was trained in the martial art of Quak-Fu. In the 2001 miniseries, as a mocking gesture toward Disney's mascot [[Mickey Mouse]] and as a reference to a previous lawsuit with the company over Howard's similarity to Donald Duck, Howard was turned into various other animals, but primarily appeared in the series as an anthropomorphic [[mouse]].<ref name="Schroeder">{{cite web |url= http://www.silverbulletcomicbooks.com/features/99564488180361.htm |title= Steve Gerber: The Dark Duck Returns|first= Darren|last= Schroeder|date= July 20, 2001|publisher= SilverBulletComicBooks.com|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20020815054620/http://www.silverbulletcomicbooks.com/features/99564488180361.htm|archive-date=August 15, 2002 |url-status= dead|access-date= February 3, 2013}}</ref>

In the [[Amalgam Comics]] universe, Howard the Duck is fused with [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]] to become [[Lobo the Duck]].

===Other comics===

* In [[Adam Beechen]]'s ending of ''[[Doctor Fate]]: More Pain Comics'', which Gerber left unfinished when he died, Howard, who is heard but unseen (his speech balloon ends with "waaugh"), dispatched the [[Elf with a Gun]] to destroy [[Nergal|Negal]] and [[Ymp]], then invited for one last drink with Yah, Bev, [[Thundarr the Barbarian|Thunny]], and [[Omega the Unknown|Megs]] before Yah goes back "upstairs."<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Adam Beechen|Beechen, Adam]]|penciller= [[Stephen Jorge Segovia|Segovia, Stephen Jorge]]|inker= Segovia, Stephen Jorge|story= More Pain Comics, Part Eight: Small Magic|title= Countdown to Mystery|issue= #8|date= June 2008}}</ref>

===Newspaper comic strip===
Between June 6, 1977 and October 29, 1978, Howard the Duck appeared in a syndicated daily comic strip that comic strip historian [[Allan Holtz]] has described as having low distribution and that was eventually replaced by the [[The Incredible Hulk (comic strip)|''Incredible Hulk'' comic strip]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://strippersguide.blogspot.com/2010/01/obscurity-of-day-howard-duck.html|title= Obscurity of the Day: Howard the Duck|first= Allan|last= Holtz|date= January 27, 2010|publisher= Stripper's Guide|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120309201726/http://strippersguide.blogspot.com/2010/01/obscurity-of-day-howard-duck.html|archive-date=March 9, 2012 |url-status= live|access-date= June 4, 2012|quote= The newspaper strip version began on June 6, 1977 at the height of Howard-mania. At first Steve Gerber and Gene Colan, the creative team on the comic book, handled the strip as well. Colan, however, dropped out after just five months, and his job was taken over by [[Val Mayerik]], who was occasionally spelling Colan on the comic book.}}</ref> The strip was syndicated in almost 70 newspapers<ref name="KennethTuran">{{cite news |last=Turan|first=Kenneth|date=December 27, 1977 |title=Trapped In A World He Never Made! |newspaper=[[Washington Post]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1977/12/27/trapped-in-a-world-he-never-made/4c041e9d-67d7-4033-90a7-fee748e349a5/ |access-date=May 14, 2021}}</ref> (by the [[Register and Tribune Syndicate]]), including the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' and ''[[Spokane Daily Chronicle]]''. When the strip was dropped by the ''[[The Plain Dealer|Cleveland Plain Dealer]]'', a Cleveland TV station began televising the strip for two minutes each night.<ref name="KennethTuran" />

A total of eleven story arcs, as well as a number of single-joke strips, constitute the 511 individual strips that were printed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nemsworld.com/howard/ |title=''Howard the Duck'' strip listing and compilation|publisher=Nemsworld.com|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141017184058/http://www.nemsworld.com/howard/|archive-date= October 17, 2014|url-status= live|access-date= June 4, 2012}}</ref>

The strip started with original stories written by Steve Gerber and illustrated by Gene Colan: "Pop Syke -- The Consciousness of Success", "The Cult of Entropy" and "Fred Feenix the Self-Made Man". The latter was started by Colan and completed by [[Val Mayerik]], who stayed on to do two additional Gerber-scripted stories: "The Sleigh Jacking" and "In Search of the Good Life".<ref name=Holtz>{{cite book |last1=Holtz |first1=Allan |title=American Newspaper Comics: An Encyclopedic Reference Guide |date=2012 |publisher=The University of Michigan Press |location=Ann Arbor |isbn=9780472117567 |page=196}}</ref>

These were followed by an adaptation of the "Sleep of the Just" story from issue #4 of the Marvel comic, scripted by Gerber and illustrated by Alan Kupperberg. Gerber was fired from the strip in early 1978 over chronic problems with deadlines.<ref name=tcj41p7>{{cite journal|title = Marvel Fires Gerber|journal= The Comics Journal|issue = #41|page = 7|publisher = [[Fantagraphics Books]]|date = August 1978|location= Stamford, Connecticut<!--location in 1978-->}}</ref> He was replaced by Marv Wolfman as writer, while Alan Kupperberg continued as artist. The remaining stories were: "Close Encounters of the Fowl Kind", "The Tuesday Ruby", "The Clone Ranger", "Bye Bye, Beverly" and "The Mystery of the Maltese Human".<ref name=Holtz/> As the series drew to an end, its already meager list of client papers shrank, making copies of these last post-Gerber stories particularly hard to find.

In November 1978, the first of a projected eight-issue series reprinting the entire strip was published by John Zawadzki. Titled ''It's Adventure Time With...Howard the Duck'', only the initial issue was published.<ref>{{gcdb series|id= 7018|title= ''It's Adventure Time With...Howard the Duck''}}</ref>

===Radio===
In 1980, a pilot for a radio show version of Howard was recorded. [[James Belushi]] played the role of Howard, although the program was never aired.<ref>{{cite magazine|title= Belushi Voice|magazine= [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|page= 21|date= October 4, 1980|location= New York City|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=DCUEAAAAMBAJ&q=howard+the+duck+radio+show&pg=PT20}}</ref>

==Reception==
Michael Burkett of the [[Orange County Register]] described Howard the Duck as a "cantankerous, stogie-chomping, nattily dressed" [[antihero]] with an "acerbic wit, irascible personality and down-and-dirty street smarts" that distinguished him from other cartoon animal characters. Burkett likened Howard to "Donald Duck cross-bred with [[Groucho Marx]] and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]." He wrote that Howard's "cult-worshipped" 1970s comic book series brought the "surrealism, social commentary, political satire and what-the-hell-am-I-doing-here philosophy" of 1960s "underground comics" into the mainstream.<ref name="MichaelBurkett">{{cite news |last=Burkett |first=Michael |date=August 4, 1986 |title=Trapped in a movie he never made |work=[[Orange County Register|Santa Ana Orange County Register]] |url=https://newspaperarchive.com/entertainment-clipping-aug-04-1986-2120726/ |access-date=May 13, 2021}}</ref> [[The New Yorker]] said Howard believed in "mainstream social Darwinism" and was "a web-footed [[Eric Hoffer]]." [[Kenneth Turan]] of [[The Washington Post]] called Howard "an Everyman with feathers, forever shooting his mouth off, battling a gloomy reality."<ref name="KennethTuran" />

Marvel editor-in-chief [[Roy Thomas]] thought that Howard, as a "funny animal" character, was inappropriate for the horror comic book in which he was introduced. He told Gerber to dispose of the character "as fast as you can." After Gerber showed Howard seemingly dying by falling into a void, Marvel's "office was flooded with letters" of protest. One fan even sent in a duck carcass to make his point. At [[San Diego Comic-Con]], the auditorium stood up and applauded when a fan asked Thomas if Howard would ever come back. Marvel responded by bringing Howard back for more appearances and soon launching his own self-titled comic book series.<ref name="Grantland">{{cite web|last=Howe|first=Sean|date=October 4, 2012 |title=First Serial: Marvel Comics, The Untold Story |work=[[Grantland]] |url=https://grantland.com/features/an-excerpt-sean-howe-marvel-comics-untold-story/ |access-date=May 13, 2021}}</ref>

Howard the Duck #1 "was the best-selling book Marvel ever had (that wasn’t based on a movie)" according to artist Frank Brunner.<ref name="JonCooke">{{cite web|last=Cooke|first=Jon B.|date=July 22, 1999 |title=Of Doctors and Ducks |work=TwoMorrows |url=https://twomorrows.com/comicbookartist/articles/06brunner.html |access-date=May 13, 2021}}</ref> The debut issue of his series instantly became a target of speculators and "occasionally sold for as much as $25." Comic-book dealer Jim Kovacs said he followed a delivery truck on the day of its release and "bought 900 copies right off the newsstands."<ref name="KennethTuran" /> Marvel's circulation director Ed Shukin said he "underestimated" demand, only printing 275,000 copies, the minimum amount allowed at the time.<ref name="Underestimated">{{cite magazine |last=Singer |first=Mark |date=January 30, 1977 |title=Underestimated Duck |magazine=[[The New Yorker]] |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1977/02/07/underestimated-duck |access-date=May 14, 2021}}</ref> By December 1977, the issue was selling for an average price of $12.50, which [[comic book price guide]] publisher [[Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide|Robert Overstreet]] described as "the most phenomenal growth of any comic book that has been published."<ref name="KennethTuran" /> Gerber was angry about the hoarding situation, "I felt as if the book had been sabotaged by the very people who supposedly liked the character."

After Gerber parted ways with Marvel in 1978 amid numerous legal and creative disputes, and other writers took over for him, Howard the Duck's popularity diminished rapidly. [[Stan Lee]], Shooter and Gerber himself criticized the post-Gerber stories for their lack of substance and clever humor. Within three years of Gerber's departure, Marvel had ceased publishing new Howard the Duck material. Lucasfilm's big-budget 1986 ''Howard the Duck'' movie disappointed critics, audiences and the character's fans alike. Although Marvel has occasionally released new Howard comic books, some written by Gerber, and sometimes features the character in other media, Howard's popularity has never again approached what it was in the 1970s.<ref name="Martin" />
