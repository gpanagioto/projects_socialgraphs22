What do you mean?  Four bikes, one common theme.  I'll start looking for costumes! What theme are we thinking? There's no time. Let's face it. We can't be in the bike parade. Oh yeah! The mall! There's nobody here. Are you the only one still at the mall? I think maybe it was a bad idea to come here, you guys. Yeah. And the four of us are actually doing a group theme.
