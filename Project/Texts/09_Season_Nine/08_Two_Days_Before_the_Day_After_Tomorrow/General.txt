Come on, people, we're running out of time! We need all Army helicopters to the Southern states for evacuation NOW! Tell them that the government can't help them, but that we're very sorry. You know the plan, people! We can only evacuate citizens below this line!  WHAT?? What?? Oh my God. Quick! Radio the helicopters!  Global warming didn't cause the Beaverton flood. We know now whose fault it is.  Crab people!
