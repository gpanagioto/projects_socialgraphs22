==Fictional character biography==
===Lazarus Lane===
Lazarus Lane is the original iteration of El Diablo, operating in the later half of the 19th century in the [[American Old West]]. Lane was originally a [[bank teller]] who is nearly killed by a gang of thieves and put in a [[coma]] after being struck by [[lightning]]. After being revived by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[Shamanism|shaman]] "Wise Owl", Lane becomes the vigilante El Diablo.<ref name="dc-ency"/> The name [[wiktionary:El Diablo|El Diablo]] means "the devil" in [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

According to ''[[Jonah Hex]]'' vol. 2 #11 (November 2006) and #24 (December 2007), Lazarus Lane is cursed to be the host of a minor demon which acts as a [[Spectre (comics)|Spirit of Vengeance]]. Lane's body slumbers in a coma while "El Diablo" roams the Earth. His fate is similar to that of the current [[Crimson Avenger#Current Crimson Avenger|Crimson Avenger]]. In ''Swamp Thing'' vol. 2 #85 (April 1989), Wise Owl is shown in a more villainous light, with Lane/El Diablo his unwilling servant. In that story, set in 1872, a number of DC's western heroes (including the aforementioned Hex, [[Bat Lash]], [[Johnny Thunder (John Tane)]], and Madame .44) were employed by Otto Von Hammer and [[Jason Blood]] to defeat Wise Owl and recover from him an object of great power, which turned out to be a crystal containing the spirit of [[Swamp Thing]], who had become lost in time. When the group killed Wise Owl, Lane's comatose body woke up, and El Diablo apparently vanished forever.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

In ''[[The New 52]]'' (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe), Lazarus Lane appeared in a backup feature in ''[[All-Star Western]]''. In this iteration, he was once again cursed by Wise Owl to become the host of a demon. Rather than being in a coma, Lazarus remains awake. However, El Diablo arises from his body whenever he is unconscious.<ref name=Guide>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=99}}</ref>

===Rafael Sandoval===
Rafael Sandoval was the second iteration created in 1989 by writer [[Gerard Jones]] and artist [[Mike Parobeck]] as a title set in the modern DC Universe. This title lasted 16 months. As created by Jones and Parobeck, Sandoval is a rookie member of the city council of Dos Rios, Texas, who creates his version of El Diablo (from a festival costume and an old boxing persona and local legends surrounding the Devil) after being stymied by officials while trying to pursue the case of a serial arsonist.<ref name="dc-ency"/> Subsequent efforts involved battles with illicit drug smugglers using maquiladora covers for their activities, a hunt for a serial killer, conflicts with human-smuggling operations, and with Sandoval's own conscience over how best to serve the people of Dos Rios.

Rafael Sandoval's character has subsequently made guest appearances in one of the ''[[Justice League]]'' titles, in which he is possessed by the spirit of an [[Aztec]] god-emperor and takes on an appearance reminiscent of the Lazarus Lane Diablo.<ref name="dc-ency"/> He also appears in the ''[[Villains United|Villains United Special]]'' when he is pulled out of retirement by [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]] to serve in her ''de facto'' Justice League, whereupon he is attacked by a member of the [[Royal Flush Gang]] during a battle at the Enclave M prison in the [[Sonora|Sonora Valley]], [[Mexico]]. He is wounded in the battle, but saved from death by the warden of the facility.

===Chato Santana===
The current iteration of El Diablo is Chato Santana, an ex-criminal who after being hospitalized, meets a still living comatose Lazarus Lane.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com//comics/080616-dc-solicits-sept08.html |title=DC Comics' September 2008 Solicitations |publisher=Newsarama.com |access-date=April 2, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showpost.php?p=4739328&postcount=1 |title=NEWSARAMA – View Single Post – EL DIABLO RETURNS AT DC IN 2008 |publisher=Forum.newsarama.com |date=November 17, 2007 |access-date=April 2, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210175228/http://forum.newsarama.com/showpost.php?p=4739328&postcount=1 |archive-date=February 10, 2009 }}</ref> It is written by Jai Nitz, pencilled by [[Phil Hester (comics)|Phil Hester]], with inks by [[Ande Parks]].<ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/080802-ElDiablo.html Jai Nitz & Phil Hester – Introducing El Diablo], [[Newsarama]], August 2, 2008</ref>

In [[The New 52]] reboot of DC's continuity, Santana's El Diablo is a member of the [[Suicide Squad]]. He is later recruited into [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]] under the leadership of Uncle Sam, until he realizes that he is being lied to and abandons them in search of the truth.

When the Squad confronts Enchantress, El Diablo helps them resist Enchantress's illusions of what they want most if they surrender.
