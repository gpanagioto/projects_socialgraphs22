What's the matter with him? You got served? By who? So wha- so what'd you do? D'you dance back? What? Yo-you got served and just stood there and took it? No, that's crap, Sharon. Stanley, when somebody challenges you to dance, you have to dance back at them, or else they'll think you're weak.  Put on some loose-fitting clothes and meet me in the garage! Now!  All right son, dancing is all about a frame of mind. Now, I'm not telling you to go around challenging other kids to dance, but when they challenge you, you just look 'em straight in the eye and give 'em this. Come on, Stan. ...six, seven, eight.  What? So what happened? Uh, hey, ex- excuse me. Hi, uh, my name is Randy Marsh. I'm Stan Marsh's father. Uh, listen. Uh, it was my fault that Stanley served your boys the other day. Uh, I told him to do it and I... We- well look I, I just came down here to tell you... it-  it- it's not on. No, no, no, it's not on. It isn't on. Nothing's on. It's off. I'm keeping my son home Saturday. I just came by to let you know so you can... put a stop to all this. Goodbye.  Aw, mph! Uuuugh-ah.  Ungh! Grrgh. Stan? Stan? Stan, listen to me. I don't want you feeling like you have to do that competition now to avenge me.  You did it, son! You did it!
