==Fictional character biographies==

===Golden Age===
{{main|Whizzer (Robert Frank)}}

===Silver Age===
{{main|Speed Demon (comics)}}
The Squadron Sinister are created by the cosmic entity the [[Grandmaster (comics)|Grandmaster]] to battle the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], who are the champions of the time-traveling [[Kang (comics)|Kang]]. The Whizzer, James Sanders, battles Avenger [[Henry Pym|Goliath]], but the fight is interrupted by the [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]]. The Avengers eventually defeat the Squadron, who are abandoned by the Grandmaster.<ref>''Avengers'' #69 – 71 (Oct. – Dec. 1969)</ref> The Squadron reappear in the title ''The Defenders'', reunited by the [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[Nebulon (comics)|Nebulon]]. The villains receive greater power in exchange for the planet Earth, and create a giant laser cannon in the [[Arctic]] to melt the [[polar ice caps]], thereby covering the entirety of the Earth's surface in water. The [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] prevent the scheme and defeat the villains (and Nebulon); [[Namor the Sub-Mariner]] humiliates the Whizzer.<ref>''Defenders'' #13 – 14 (May – July 1974)</ref>

Afterward the Whizzer and his two remaining teammates are teleported off world by Nebulon, returning with an energy-draining weapon. The Squadron Sinister plan to threaten the Earth again but are defeated once more by the Defenders and the Avenger [[Henry Pym|Yellowjacket]].<ref>''Giant-Size Defenders'' #4 (1974)</ref> The character has another brief encounter with several members of the Avengers, who seek a way to separate the Power Prism of [[Doctor Spectrum]] from fellow Avenger the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]].<ref>''Avengers'' Annual #8 (1978)</ref> The Whizzer disassociates himself from the Squadron Sinister and adopts a new costume and alias, [[Speed Demon (comics)|Speed Demon]].

===Bronze Age===
{{see also|Squadron Supreme}}
Roy Thomas and penciller [[John Buscema]] created an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate-universe]] team of heroes called the [[Squadron Supreme]], who debut in ''Avengers'' #85 (Feb. 1971). After an initial skirmish with four Avengers, the teams unite to stop a common threat.<ref>''Avengers'' #86 (Mar. 1971)</ref> The characters including the Whizzer, whose name is Stanley Stewart, were identical in name and appearance to the Squadron Sinister, which caused confusion in Marvel's production department, as the covers of ''The Avengers'' #85 and #141 (Nov. 1975) "cover-blurbed" appearances by the Squadron Sinister, when in fact it was the Squadron Supreme that appeared in both issues.

As a result of exposure to the [[mutagenic]] effects of a fogbank of unknown nature, Stanley Stewart possesses superhuman speed, stamina, and reflexes. When moving at subsonic speed, the Stewart Whizzer can create cyclones (by running in circles); run up walls and across water. The character has limited immunity to the effects of friction (Stewart wears [[goggles]] to protect his eyes), although still generates normal fatigue poisons. As a result, Stewart must consume large amounts of [[calories]] and rest after using his superhuman speed powers extensively.

The heroic Whizzer and the Squadron Supreme have another series of skirmishes with the Avengers engineered by the group the '''Serpent Cartel''', but eventually team together and prevent the use of the [[Magic item|artifact]] the [[Serpent Crown]].<ref>''Avengers'' #141 – 144 (Nov. 1975 – Feb. 1976) & #147 – 149 (May – July 1976)</ref>  The character and his teammates briefly feature in the title ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'', when the evil version of [[Hyperion (comics)#Zhib-Ran|Hyperion]] attacks the Earth-712 version and then Thunder God Thor.<ref>''Thor'' #280 (Feb. 1979)</ref> The Squadron are mind-controlled by the entities the [[Overmind (comics)|Over-Mind]] and Null the Living Darkness, but are freed by the Defenders and aid the heroes in defeating the villains.<ref>''Defenders'' #112 – 114 (Oct. – Dec. 1982)</ref>

The character features with the Squadron Supreme in a self-titled 12-issue [[miniseries]] (Sept. 1985 – Aug. 1986) by writer [[Mark Gruenwald]].<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' #1 – 12 (Sep. 1985 – Aug. 1986)</ref> The series also explains why there are the Squadrons Sinister and Supreme are similar: the Grandmaster creates the Squadron Sinister modelled on the already-existing Squadron Supreme of the [[Earth-712]] universe.<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' #8 (May 1986)</ref> 
Gruenwald, Ryan, and [[inker]] [[Al Williamson]] created a [[graphic-novel]] sequel<ref>''Squadron Supreme: Death of a Universe'' (1989)</ref> which [[marooning|maroons]] the team in the mainstream Marvel universe. The Whizzer and teammates encounter the hero [[Quasar (Wendell Vaughn)|Quasar]], and relocate to the government facility [[Features of the Marvel Universe#Project_Pegasus|Project Pegasus]]. After another encounter with the Overmind and a visit to the [[laboratory]] world of the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]];<ref>''Quasar'' #13 – 16 (Aug. – Nov. 1990)</ref> the Whizzer participates in a "speedster" race organized by [[Elder of the Universe]] the [[Runner (comics)|Runner]]<ref>''Quasar'' #17 (Dec. 1990)</ref> attempts (with the Squadron) to return to their universe <ref>''Quasar'' #19 (Feb. 1991)</ref> and with fellow members [[Hyperion (Marvel Comics)|Hyperion]] and [[Doctor Spectrum#Joe Ledger (Earth-712)|Doctor Spectrum]] battle the entity Deathurge.<ref>''Quasar'' #25 (Aug. 1991)</ref>

The entire Squadron Supreme appear in a two-part story with the Avengers that finally returns them to their home universe, where they disband for a time.<ref>''Avengers/Squadron Supreme Annual '98'' and the [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] ''Squadron Supreme: New World Order'' (both Sept. 1998)</ref> The Whizzer rejoins his teammates to aid the [[Interdimensional being|interdimensional]] team the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]].<ref>''Exiles'' vol. 2, #77 – 78 (Apr. – May 2006)</ref>

[[Image:Blur HCV.gif|185px|thumb|right|The Atlanta Blur from ''Supreme Power'' #5.<br>Art by [[Dan Buckley]].]]
The mature-audience [[Marvel MAX]] imprint showcases the adventures of the Earth-31916 version of the Whizzer, '''the Atlanta Blur'''. Also named Stanley Stewart, the character is a young [[African-American]] man who develops super-speed as a result of exposure to an alien [[retrovirus]].<ref name="Supreme Power #12 Oct. 2004">''Supreme Power'' #12 (Oct. 2004)</ref> He initially hides his ability, with the "Atlanta Blur" regarded as an [[urban legend]],<ref>''Supreme Power'' #3 (Dec. 2003)</ref> but when Hyperion is publicly revealed Stewart also goes public,<ref>''Supreme Power'' #4 (Jan. 2004)</ref> becoming a celebrity with numerous endorsements. As the Blur, he reluctantly fights crime at the request of [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)|Nighthawk]].<ref name="Supreme Power #12 Oct. 2004"/>

===Squadron Supreme of America===
A variation of the Stanley Stewart version of Blur appears as a member of the Squadron Supreme of America.<ref>''Avengers'' #700. Marvel Comics.</ref> This version is a [[simulacrum]] created by [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] and programmed by the Power Elite. Stanley was programmed to forcefully watch endless loops to keep up his brain speed while watching numerous S.H.I.E.L.D. files and unscrupulous videos. In his personal time, he works as a computer programmer at an office building in Washington DC.<ref name="Avengers #18">''Avengers'' Vol. 8 #18. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In the team's first mission, Whizzer and the Squadron Supreme of America fought [[Namor]] and the Defenders of the Deep, when they targeted a Roxxon oil platform off the coast of Alaska.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 8 #10. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Soon after, the Squadron Supreme visited another oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico. The Squadron Supreme then made short work of Namor and the Defenders of the Deep.<ref>''Free Comic Book Day 2019 #Avengers. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the ''[[War of the Realms]]'' storyline, Stanley was working at his desk until he and the other members of the Squadron Supreme of America were summoned to Washington D.C., where Phil Coulson brought them up to speed with [[Malekith the Accursed]]'s invasion. Blur and the Squadron Supreme of America fight an army of [[Trolls (Marvel Comics)|Rock Trolls]] and [[Giants (Marvel Comics)|Frost Giants]]. After the Squadron Supreme caused the Frost Giants to retreat, Phil Coulson sends them to Ohio, which has become a battleground.<ref name="Avengers #18"/>

Blur was with the Squadron Supreme when they attempted to apprehend Black Panther, after he infiltrated the Pentagon to confront Phil Coulson.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 8 #21. Marvel Comics.</ref>
