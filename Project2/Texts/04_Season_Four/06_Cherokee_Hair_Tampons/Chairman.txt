Mr. Garrison, after very careful review the school board believes that you should take a... hiatus from teaching. Indefinitely. Did you know that not one of your students knew who Sam Adams was? ...Frankly, Mr. Garrison, it isn't even your educational record that we're most concerned about.  It's your somewhat substantial police record. We're sorry, Mr. Garrison, we have no choice. Mr. Garrison, most teachers do not carry a gun!
