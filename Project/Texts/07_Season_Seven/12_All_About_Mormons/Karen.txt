 Oh, Mr. Marsh! What a treat! It's so nice to meet you! With chocolate frosting  I hear you're a geologist. That is so amazing. We just moved here from Utah and we're so used to everyone being Mormon that we... Oh, we forget not everyone wants to hear about it. Oh boy, you must be furious! Randy, the last thing we want is for people to think we're pushing our religion. We know there are a lot of beliefs out there and ours just works for us. Look, we painted our faces!  Aw, we'll all see each other tonight when we go to Stan's house for dinner. Stay and play with your friend, Gary.  You must be Mrs. Marsh; it's so nice to meet you!
