I know. I can't afford a cruise, dude. Shut up, Cartman! You can say ''that'' again. Yeu-bluuuch. I'll kick your ass, Cartman! Bluuuch. You guy can stop fighting. It was ''me'' she was checking out! Yeah, that one! No. Sure, Wendy, whatever. Yeah! We'll go to the mall tonight! Bluuch! I'd love to. That's not Kyle's... We've ''got'' to learn how to do that, dude!  Pf-looser gift, pf-looser gift. Bluuch. See? She liked ''my'' present the best! No you're not! I don't think I missed ''any''! I bet I scored 100! Oh, hi, Wendy. That's impossible! What happened? Didn't you make sweet love to her? A whatbian? Kenny? No, explain it to us, Chef. Oh. Hey, man. If she only likes other lesbians, then all we gotta do is become lesbians, too! You're just saying that, Cartman. What the hell are you doing, Cartman? Well I got a...Indi-glo...Girls CD. The guy at the record store said it was ''perfect''. I can't wait for Ms. Ellen to see what a raging lesbian I am. No, you're a ''fatter'' lesbian than me. Wow. Hi, Wendy. Wow! Oh, no, Mr. Garrison's back. Bluuch. Kick ass! Are we making love now? They don't have a fireplace here; we shouldn't be making love yet. You have to make love down by the fire, that's what Chef always says. But why? It's because I'm not a lesbian, isn't it? I think so. Yup. Yup. Did I ''what''? Oh my God, she killed Kenny! Wow. I can't believe Ms. Ellen was a criminal Iraqi fugitive. Well, I guess I'm sorry that I was ignoring you and stuff. Bluuuuch! Sorry.
