The character was played by [[Hiroyuki Sanada]] in the 2013 film ''[[The Wolverine (film)|The Wolverine]]''.

==Publication history==
Shingen first appeared in ''[[Wolverine (comic book)|Wolverine]]'' #1 (Sept. 1982) and was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Frank Miller]].

==Fictional character biography==
"Mariko Yashida" was the daughter of Japanese crime lord "Lord Shingen", leader of Clan "Yashida". She first met the feral mutant Wolverine when the X-Men sought the help of her cousin, the Japanese mutant hero Sunfire. Although initially frightened by the ferocious-looking Wolverine, Mariko found herself attracted to him. Similarly, Wolverine was charmed by her beauty and refined manner. The two spent a great deal of time together in Japan, ultimately falling in love when she visited him in New York. To settle a [[consumer debt|personal debt]] incurred during his rise to power, Shingen forced his daughter [[Mariko Yashida]] to marry criminal boss Noboru Hideki.<ref name="Wolverine #1">''Wolverine'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] found out Noboru beat Mariko nearly to death and confronted Noboru but relented from killing him upon Mariko's insistence. Shingen had Wolverine poisoned, temporarily weakening him so that Shingen could beat and humiliate the superhuman [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] in a duel with [[bokken]] in front of Mariko. Shingen used his expert knowledge of human anatomy to secretly attack Wolverine's nerve endings in such a way so as to make the duel life-threatening. But as Mariko did not know this, when Wolverine attempted to use his claws to save himself, it appeared to Mariko that Wolverine was cheating. Mariko did not know that Wolverine's body had been saturated with enough lethal poison to kill several dozen ordinary men, or that Shingen was the one who was actually cheating in the duel. This had the effect of disgracing Wolverine in front of her, which was the design of Shingen.<ref>''Wolverine'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Logan was then dumped onto the Tokyo streets and found by [[Yukio (comics)|Yukio]], Shingen's best assassin, who participated in deception with the [[The Hand (comics)|Hand]] ninja clan to manipulate Wolverine into assassinating a rival crime lord, using Mariko as unwitting bait for additional motivation. After his role was completed, Shingen ordered Logan killed, but Yukio ignored the order. This led to the Hand being sent to enforce his will. In the events resulting from that action, including the death of a personal friend by Yukio, Wolverine realized that Yukio was the one who poisoned him at Shingen's residence and was being played for a fool at apparently Shingen's orders.<ref>''Wolverine'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> After a philosophic epiphany about humanity, Logan then completely destroyed the Yashida criminal empire and confronted Shingen a second time. Shingen did not survive the confrontation. Mariko revealed she'd planned to kill her dishonorable father personally then commit [[seppuku]] in recompense had not Logan prevented her. Afterward, Mariko and Wolverine decided to marry, with the [[X-Men]] receiving an invitation from the [[Emperor of Japan]] for the event.<ref>''Wolverine'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> 

It is later revealed that his illegitimate son [[Kenuichio Harada]] wanted to inherit Shingen's position.<ref>''The New Mutants'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #172. Marvel Comics.</ref> 

Shingen was briefly resurrected by Phaedra of the [[The Hand (comics)|Hand]] as part of a campaign of revenge against Wolverine.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 3 #61. Marvel Comics.</ref>
