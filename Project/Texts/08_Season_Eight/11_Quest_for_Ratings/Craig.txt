  Oh hey guys. Heard about your ''news'' show being cancelled. Yeah, well, I've got an overall deal with the school, heh. They're paying me six dollars a week to come up with new shows.  This much more than you had! Hey, a round of root beers for everyone! On me!  Hey gang, I brought the new episode of wide angle, close-up animals.   You wanted to see me, Mr. Meryl?
