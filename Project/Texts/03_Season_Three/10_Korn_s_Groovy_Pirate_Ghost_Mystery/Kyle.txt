Of course, dumbass, it's Halloween.  Those things are stupid, Cartman. They just stick your hand in cold spaghetti and tell you it's intestines and stuff.  The what? Nuh-uh. Yeah! Let's see how ''they'' like it! That's not scary, fatass! He must have a ''huge'' bone in his ass, then.  Yeah, fatass, a dead body. Yeah, fatass, it has to be real to be scary! Yeah, fatass, we're gonna dig up-  Dig up Kyle's dead grandma?? Are you insane?! Dude! We're not digging up ''my'' grandma; I'll get in trouble.  Naww, let's dig up somebody else.  Wait. I don't know if this is cool. I don't think my mom would want me doin' this. I don't really care, dude. Oh, my God.  Hi, ...Grandma.  Aaaah! Damnit, Cartman, that's not funny! Alright, alright, let's get this over with so we can put her back! How exactly are we gonna use her to scare them? Alright, that does it, Cartman! That's my grandma! You show her some God-damned respect! Cartman?! Yeah. They're tryin' to scare everybody 'cause they're gay wads. Shouldn't we hide her better than that? Wait till you guys see ''my'' costume! It's gonna be sweet! No Grandma??  She's not here! Well, she's ''not'' here! That's just great! Thanks a lot, Stan! You're gonna get me busted again! God-damnit! ''Now'', what the hell are we gonna do?! Somebody took my dead grandma. Now she's doomed to walk the earth in limbo.  Then, you'll help us? Right.  Wow! That was easy. Whoa. What was that? Yeah! Where's Grandma?
