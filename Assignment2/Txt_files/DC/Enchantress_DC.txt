The '''Enchantress''' is a [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. Created by [[Bob Haney]] and [[Howard Purcell]], the character made her first appearance in ''[[Strange Adventures]]'' #187 (April 1966).<ref name=Guide>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=101}}</ref>

In the [[DC Universe]], the Enchantress, whose real name is '''June Moone''', is a freelance artist and powerful sorceress typically depicted as an antihero and hero on account of the Enchantress persona, coming into fruition from the possession between June the magical being that once called herself '''The Succubus'''. One of the world's most dangerous magic users, she struggles to contain the dark personality and intentions of her Enchantress persona. She is a member of several groups such as the Suicide Squad and, as a hero, a member of Shadowpact and the Sentinels of Magic. In more recent continuities, the Enchantress is instead an interdimensional witch possessing the human June Moone and is considered a separate entity from June although the two share the same body. This version of the character is cast as a member of Justice League Dark as June Moone while both June and Enchantress would serve as a re-occurring member of the Suicide Squad, appearing in a new incarnation of the team in the fifth volume of the comic series as well as appearing as a member of its paranormal counterpart.

The Enchantress would make an appearance in mainstream media, portrayed by [[Cara Delevingne]] in the 2016 film ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]'' as both June Moone and the Enchantress, the latter portrayed as a separate entity possessing her body. The Enchantress entity would also be portrayed by Samantha Liana Cole on the show ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'', which is part of the [[Arrowverse]]. Enchantress and June Moone would make an appearance in ''[[Injustice 2]]'' similar to their recent depictions although the Enchantress entity, the playable fighter, would describe herself as an actual [[Succubus|succubus]].

Since the cancellation of ''Shadowpact'', the Enchantress has continued to make minor appearances in the DC Universe, including ''DC Universe Holiday Special'' (2008), and the miniseries ''[[Reign in Hell]]'' #2–8 (September 2008–April 2009). She appeared in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #885 (March 2010), part of a new cycle of stories by [[James Robinson (writer)|James Robinson]] which led up to the DC Comics 2010 limited series ''[[War of the Supermen]]''.

Their first enemy was the Enchantress gone mad.

==Fictional character biography==
'''June Moone'''{{#tag:ref|Her surname has been spelled both "Moon" and "Moone", but it was originally "Moone".|group=Note|name=note1}} was a freelance artist who was invited to a costume party at an old castle, and stumbled upon a secret chamber where an unknown magical being (later named as Dzamor)<ref name="Earthquake" />{{#tag:ref|Post-''Crisis'' called "Dhazmor" in a flashback sequence – "Devil to Pay" in ''Suicide Squad'' #15 (July 1988).|group=Note|name=note2}} empowered her to fight an evil presence in the castle. Saying the words "The Enchantress", her appearance changes from the blonde-haired June to the black-haired and costumed Enchantress and defeats a [[minotaur]] creature from a tapestry.<ref name="TerrorCastle" /> Soon after, she defeats a monster at [[Cape Canaveral|Cape Kennedy]]<ref name="BeautyBeast" /> and a mirage of a demonic creature manipulated by a crook.<ref name="GuardianEye" />

In her next appearance, however, the Enchantress is a misguided character fighting Supergirl, who prevents her gaining omnipotent magical power and cancelling all other superpowers on Earth, twice.<ref name="Earthquake" /><ref name="MagicMiami" />{{#tag:ref|After the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' crossover event, this was [[Retroactive continuity|retcon]]ned to have been [[Power Girl]] instead of Supergirl, as Supergirl had been removed from DC continuity.<ref name="Markstein" />|group=Note|name=note4}} Her villainous side takes over after this, and the Enchantress then continues her career as a member of the Forgotten Villains<ref name="DCCP77" /><ref name="DCCP78" /> and part of the army of supervillains during the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' crossover event.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= Wolfman, Marv|penciller= [[George Pérez|Pérez, George]]|inker= [[Jerry Ordway|Ordway, Jerry]]|story= Final Crisis|title= [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]|issue= #12|date= March 1986}}</ref>

{{Main article|Suicide Squad}}
She is next recruited into the newly formed 'Task Force X', soon to be known as the '[[Suicide Squad]]', on the chance that she could keep her villainous side in check. In her first mission, she uses massive magical energy to defeat [[Brimstone (comics)|Brimstone]], which sends her over the edge and she becomes temporarily truly villainous.<ref name="Legends3" /> During her tenure with the Suicide Squad, June Moone's control over her Enchantress side becomes weaker, and she destroys at least one mission because of this;<ref>{{cite comic|writer= Ostrander, John|penciller= McDonnell, Luke|inker= Lewis, Bob|story= The Flight of the Firebird|title= [[Suicide Squad]]|issue= #5|date= September 1987}}<br/>{{cite comic|writer= Ostrander, John|penciller= McDonnell, Luke|inker= Lewis, Bob|story= Hitting the Fan|title= Suicide Squad|issue= #6|date= October 1987}}<br/>{{cite comic|writer= Ostrander, John|penciller= McDonnell, Luke|inker= Lewis, Bob|story= Thrown to the Wolves|title= Suicide Squad|issue= #7|date= November 1987}}</ref> teammate [[Deadshot]] is tasked with taking her out should she get beyond control. Eventually, [[Madame Xanadu]] diagnoses that June's loss of control is because she began using her powers before she could control them, and the only way to counteract this is not to use them until her aura, which protects her from the evil influences in magic, regains its power.

Madame Xanadu gives June a necklace that she cannot remove which, together with a ring to be held by someone else, creates a feedback loop preventing the Enchantress from using magic for evil as a temporary measure. She also raises an army to destroy the town and perform terror attacks as stated in the first mission.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= Ostrander, John|penciller= McDonnell, Luke|inker= Lewis, Bob|story= Personal Files|title= Suicide Squad|issue= #8|date= December 1987}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic|writer= Ostrander, John|penciller= McDonnell, Luke|inker= Lewis, Bob|story= Blood and Snow Part Two|title= Suicide Squad|issue= #12|date= April 1988}}</ref> June then discovers that her Enchantress persona is, in fact, a separate evil entity from another dimension fused with her, not simply a manifestation of magic. She learned this when she and other Squad members joined Nightshade on a mission to free her homeland, the Nightshade Dimension. There, she found out that the Incubus, who took over that dimension, is the brother of the Dzamor, who merges with her to give her the power of the Enchantress. The Incubus<ref>{{cite comic|writer= Ostrander, John|penciller= McDonnell, Luke|inker= Lewis, Bob|story= Devil to Pay|title= Suicide Squad|issue= #15|date= July 1988}}</ref> rips his sister out of June, leaving her powerless. Shortly afterwards, June disappears from the Suicide Squad for unknown reasons.

When June and the Enchantress are re-combined, a new entity called the Soulsinger is temporarily created, which fades away shortly after, leaving the Enchantress behind – once again a separate entity, but cut off from her powers.

===''The New 52''===
In 2011, DC Comics cancelled all their titles and relaunched 52 new comics as part of ''[[The New 52]]''. One of these was ''[[Justice League Dark]]'', which features a number of supernatural-themed heroes including [[Shade, the Changing Man]], [[Zatanna]], [[John Constantine]], and [[Madame Xanadu]] coming together to fight an insane Enchantress who has become separated from June Moone.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= [[Peter Milligan|Milligan, Peter]]|penciller= Janin, Mikel|inker= Janin, Mikel|story= In The Dark Part One: Imaginary Women|title= [[Justice League Dark]]|issue= #1|date= November 2011}}</ref> During the crisis, the Enchantress' powers begin randomly appearing across the world, causing chaos: the Sphinx of Gizah comes to life and attacks tourists and hundreds of duplicates of June Moone appear to search for the original. While the Justice League tries to intervene, the Enchantress manifests as a colossal monster made up of the bodies of hundreds of June Moones and defeats Superman, Wonder Woman and Cyborg with ease. John Constantine deduces that Madame Xanadu said an incantation that separated June Moone from the Enchantress and reads an incantation that reverses the spell, reuniting the Enchantress and June Moone again.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= Milligan, Peter|penciller= Janin, Mikel|inker= Janin, Mikel|story= In The Dark Part Two: Dark Matter|title= Justice League Dark|issue= #2|date= December 2011}}<br/>{{cite comic|writer= Milligan, Peter|penciller= Janin, Mikel|inker= Janin, Mikel|story= In The Dark Part Three: Shibboleths and Alcohol|title= Justice League Dark|issue= #3|date= January 2012}}<br/>{{cite comic|writer= Milligan, Peter|penciller= Janin, Mikel|inker= Janin, Mikel|story= In the Dark Part Four: By the Light of the Moone|title= Justice League Dark|issue= #4|date= February 2012}}<br/>{{cite comic|writer= Milligan, Peter|penciller= Janin, Mikel|inker= Janin, Mikel|story= In The Dark Finale: There Was a Crooked Man|title= Justice League Dark|issue= #5|date= March 2012}}</ref>

===''DC Rebirth''===
The Enchantress serves as a member of the Suicide Squad again and during the "Black Vault" story arc, they retrieve an alien item that serves as a portal to the Phantom Zone. However, once they bring it back to Belle Reve Penitentiary, it causes all the inmates to go into a killing frenzy except Harley Quinn, Amanda Waller, Killer Croc and Rick Flag. June Moone lets the Enchantress out, who also remains unaffected due to being a magical entity. She manages to get Harley Quinn to the Vault but is incapacitated by Zod when he sucks the air out of her lungs.

In one of the later issues, June Moone was called upon by Amanda Waller to help a military general whose house had been possessed by a demon. She turns into the Enchantress, but she ends up scheming with the demon to escape Amanda Waller and destroy the world. She turns back to June to have the demon remove the bomb device and set the Enchantress free, but the demon attacks her and frightens her. June, in retaliation, unleashes magic and banishes the demon without turning into the Enchantress.

During the ''Justice League vs. Suicide Squad'' storyline, the Enchantress is sent with the Suicide Squad to stop a cult from sinking an island as a sacrifice to their god. The Justice League arrives and clashes with the Suicide Squad and she defeats Superman with ease once she realizes he's sensitive to magic. When Maxwell Lord breaks into Belle Reve Penitentiary along with Rustam, Lobo, Doctor Polaris, the Emerald Empress and Johnny Sorrow, the original Suicide Squad, she threatens Maxwell Lord only to be quickly overwhelmed by his telepathic powers.

== Characterization ==
=== Love interests ===
Despite having been characterized as having some disdain for men,<ref name=":4">{{Cite book |last=Johns |first=Geoff |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/818866352 |title=Day of Judgment |date=2013 |others=Matthew Dow Smith |isbn=978-1-4012-3795-0 |location=New York |oclc=818866352}}</ref> June has formulated romances with characters throughout her history:

In comics, June's first love interest in publication was '''Alan Dell''', whom was attracted to the Enchantress persona not knowing that the Enchantress was also June herself. '''[[Sebastian Faust]]''' was also featured as one of her love interests; Faust and June/Enchantress first met during ''[[Day of Judgment (comics)|Day of Judgement]]'', where the two's brief friendship is interrupted when Faust sacrifices Enchantress in order to reignite the flames of Hell in a bid to eventually stop Asmodeus from completely gaining the power of the [[Spectre (DC Comics character)|Spectre]]. Attracted to June, Sebastian is guilt ridden by his actions and stays his distance as she returns to Alan.<ref name=":4" /> Sometime later, he returns to help June as the separation of the Enchantress and June slowly kills her and voiced continual hope that the two would be in a romantic relationship should he find a way to restore her Enchantress personality in order to save her from death. Eventually, Faust succeeds in doing so while seemingly sacrificing himself in a battle with a powerful sorcerer.<ref name=":3" /> '''[[Ragman (character)|Ragman]]''' was revealed to also have been attracted to Enchantress although when he kissed her, she vehemently rejected his advances.<ref name=":4" /> In recent continuities, '''[[Killer Croc]]''' also has dated Enchantress, the two of them subtly pushed together by [[Amanda Waller]] as a mean of controlling the both of them later while the two established a genuine connection.<ref name="Squad20">{{cite comic|writer=[[Rob Williams (comics)|Williams, Rob]]|penciller=[[Stjepan Šejić|Šejić, Stjepan]]|inker=Šejić, Stjepan|story=Managing People|title=[[Suicide Squad]]|volume=5|issue=#20|date=August 2017}}</ref> This would come to fruition when Killer Croc's life is leverage against June in her membership of Suicide Squad Black, a mythical counterpart to Suicide Squad, as Waller pits her against a re-invented version of Sebastian Faust (whom she doesn't share a romance with in the new continuity) and his eco-terrorist cohorts alongside the rest of the team, facing similarly manipulations.<ref>{{Cite book |last=NITZ |first=JAI |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1076506195 |title=SUICIDE SQUAD - BLACK FILES - EL DIABLO. |date=2019 |publisher=DC COMICS |isbn=978-1-4012-7858-8 |location=[Place of publication not identified] |oclc=1076506195}}</ref>

In media, June's most prominent love interest is '''[[Rick Flag (DC Extended Universe)|Rick Flag]]''' in the [[DC Extended Universe]], the former chosen by Amanda Waller deliberately so the two of them would form a close bond and become lovers, allowing her to have leverage over the two. Their relationship would come to an end in the sequel of Suicide Squad due to the death of Rick Flag.

==Powers and abilities==
The Enchantress is a powerful sorceress, considered being among the most dangerous of mystical villains to the superhuman community and one of the most dangerous magic practitioners on Earth in the [[DC Universe]] alongside peers such as the [[Wizard (DC Comics)|Wizard]] and [[Sebastian Faust]].<ref name=":2">{{Cite book |last1=Beatty |first1=Scott |title="Profile Pages" DCU Villains Secret Files and Origins #1 |last2=Johns |first2=Geoff |last3=Abnett |first3=Dan |last4=Lanning |first4=Andy |last5=Dixon |first5=Chuck |publisher=DC Comics |year=1999}}</ref> She possesses an array of magical powers including flight, the ability to phase through solid walls, the transformation of objects, and the power to transform her own appearance. She also could transform into her magical state by calling "Enchantress".<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |title=Who's Who: The Definitive Directory of the DC Universe #7 |publisher=DC Comics |date=September 1985}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite book |title=The DC comics encyclopedia: the definitive guide to the characters of the DC universe |date=2008 |author=Scott Beatty |author2=Daniel Wallace |isbn=978-0-7566-4119-1 |edition=Updated and expanded |location=New York |oclc=213309017}}</ref> A unique aspect of her power is her sensitivity to magic; She was able to link to the essence of [[Eclipso]] in the ''Day of Vengeance'' story line, using the connection to speak Eclipso's thoughts to the rest of the group, and has also mystically tracked the Spectre by divining his magical trail. She has also been seen to remotely access another magic-user's power, as she did when she channeled the power of almost all magical beings on Earth through her to Captain Marvel to aid him in his battle with the Spectre, and again with Strega of the [[The Pentacle|Pentacle]], though all of the magicians she came into contact with allowed her to tap into them.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Willingham |first=Bill |title=Day of vengeance |date=2005 |publisher=DC Comics |others=Jan Churchill, Justiniano |isbn=1-4012-0840-1 |location=New York |oclc=62511503}}</ref> Later portrayals of the character in the [[The New 52|New 52]] also grants her enough power to warp reality at will and is powerful enough to defeat [[Superman]] in battle.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The DC comics encyclopedia: the definitive guide to the characters of the DC universe |date=2021 |author=Matthew K.

While preferring to use magic, June is considered both an average athlete and hand-to-hand combatant.<ref name=":0" /> She is also a skilled artist<ref name=":1" /> and recent incarnations of June is able to call upon magical powers without invoking the Enchantress entity. As a sorceress, Enchantress has access to several arcane items: she has possession of the Nightwitch's "Herne-Ramsgate Cauldron", which allows her to find almost every magical creature in the DC Universe.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=Sturges, Matthew|penciller=[[Phil Winslade|Winslade, Phil]]|inker=Winslade, Phil|story=Darkness and Light Part Three: Reversals|title=Shadowpact|issue=#19|date=January 2008}}</ref> Her magical hat is also said to conceal various magical tricks within it.<ref name=":1" />
