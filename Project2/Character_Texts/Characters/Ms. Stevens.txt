Uh. Thank you, Mr. Garrison. <i>[cheerfully]</i> How are we all doing today?! <i>[the kids' eyes wander]</i> I can't hear you! I said, How are we all doing?! <i>[Cartman farts]</i> Children, we are a national choir called, "Getting Gay With Kids!" We're gonna do a big tour down in Central America to help save the rainforest, and you can be a part of it! You see, we take kids from all over the country and put them in a choir <i>[Pip yawns and Bill notices. Clyde nods off]</i> where we sing and dance to raise awareness about our vanishing rainforest. So, who wants to join the fun?? Excuse me? Well, uh, that's all, really. <i>[the girl picks her nose, smiling at Kenny]</i> So, if anyone is interested in seeing the rainforest and joining our choir, I'll leave information packets up front. Oh, nonono. The rainforest is very fragile. We must take only pictures and leave only footprints. Okay, children, that's all of us. We're ready to head for the Latin American nation of Costa Rica, a country filled with virgin rainforest. And you must be Eric Cartman. I've heard about you. You don't respect nature or other cultures. Well, I'm gonna change the way you think, kiddo. Oh, look, children! I think we're entering San José, which is the capital of Costa Rica. <i>[the kids move to their windows and look out]</i> Oh! This is so exciting! Eric, Costa Rica is a Third-World country. These people are much poorer than those in the U.S. Eric, sit down! Eric, SIT DOWN! Kids, this is the Costa Rican Capitol building. This is where all the leaders of the Costa Rican government make their- Alll right, that does it! <i>[turns Cartman around]</i> Eric Cartman, you respect other cultures this instant! You may think that making fun of Third-World countries is funny, but let me- Eric, will you please, please, just keep your mouth shut while we present ourselves to the Costa Rican President? Because I'll buy you some ice cream afterwards if you do. Well, it was a long trip, but the children are very excited to sing tomorrow. Uh, we're, uh, we're the choir? That, that was sent from... the United States? We're the group singing for the "Save The Rainforest" summit tomorrow? <i>[her head is cocked way to the left by now. El Presidente has no clue. Now the teacher is worried]</i> Oh dear, where's, where's Mr. Mackey? He should have been here by now. <i>[faces the kids]'' Children, do any of you speak Spanish? ''[Cartman waves his left arm]</i> Don't you dare! <i>[the main door opens]</i> Ogh! Thank goodness you're here; I don't speak any Spanish. Yeess! Oh boy! Mr. Presidente, round up your subjects outside. We have a special gift for you. The gift... uh-of song. <i>[moves aside]</i> All right, children, Let's get in our rows quickly, so we can begin. Hello, everybody. This is just a little rehearsal for tomorrow, so we may be a little rusty. <i>[chuckles and shrugs. The people just look. She presses the play button. The kids begin to dance to the music]</i> Great job, gang! You were really all over the place, Kyle. Oh, it's everything I ever dreamed it would be! Eric, what the heck are you doing?? <i>[the monkey flees]</i> <i>[pulls him away]</i> Eric, for God's sake, knock it off!! Well, Mr. Pedro, this was a great tour, but I guess we should be getting back. We have a big concert tomorrow, Don't we, kids?! The Yanagopa are gentle native people that live in the rainforest, but bulldozers are destroying their homes. Soon, they will have nowhere to go. So we must stop bulldozing the rainforest so that they can live-! Stanley, what is it? <i>[in horror]</i> Oh my God!! <i>[the snake starts swallowing Pablo]</i> <i>[petrified]</i> Jesus Christ, is he dead?! <i>[Pablo's bones come out of the snake's anus]</i> Oh, no! God, no, no! <i>[spins around]</i> Don't panic, children. Maybe we came from that way. <i>[points to her left]</i> No, nno. Let's try this way. <i>[points to her right and moves that way]</i> Oh, children, the sun is setting. We have to find our way out of here quick! Whoa-kay, okay, everything is just fine, kids. Now it is important that we all stick together. Is everybody still here? Who's not?! No, you didn't just see Tony Danza, Stanley. Don't worry, Kelly. We're gonna find our way out of the rainforest and make it back to the concert in time. We just need to respect our mother rainforest so that she will respect us. Oh, really? Could you brush it off? <i>[shows her backpack, and a huge insect half her size growls on it]</i> <i>[panics]</i> Oh, boy oh!! Oh my God, get it off me!! For the love of God, get it off me!! Oh my God!! <i>[the insect growls and falls silent. Miss Stevens returns]</i> Oh-okay, children. We must understand that the insects of the rainforest help the delicate balance of life here. <i>[sees the insect, still on her back]</i> Oh my God!! <i>[runs off]</i> Shh. Children, okay, let's try to listen to what the rainforest tells us. And if we use our ears she can tell us so many things. Perhaps- Oh, thank goodness! Hello, sir. We are lost. <i>[giggles]</i> Cah heh, can you help us? Boys, please. Not every Spanish person eats tacos and burritos. That's a stereotype. <i>[the soldier points a way out with his thumb]</i> Children, he wants us to follow him! Oooh, thank goodness! I think this ordeal is over! <i>[they leave]</i> Now kids, let's be a bit more open-minded. I read all about this in Newsweek; this is a people's army. They are fighting the fascist policies of their fascist government. <i>[addresses them with a lilt]</i> Oh, hello. Do you speak of English? Oh, wonderful! We were lost, and it is such a great coincidence we found you. You see, we're here to protest the government-sanctioned raping of your rainforest. <i>[the soldiers just stare]</i> We are fighters, just like you. Could you help us get back to San José? <i>[no response]</i> Um... <i>[thinks]</i> Oh, I know! Perhaps you would like a gift. Well, we have o-honly-hee one gift to give. The gift... of song <i>[she moves aside]</i> <i>[through clenched teeth]</i> Kyle, for the love of God, do the right choreography. <i>[as the chorus nears, Kyle is still doing the wrong moves]</i> Oh, Kyle, please! <i>[the kids dance through the first line of the chorus...]</i> Well, we hope that our gift of song has warmed your hearts. Uh, yah, soooo, do you have a phone we could use? <i>[sullen]</i> Is it because of the little Jewish boy's choreography? Run, children, run!  Hello?? Anybody?? Help?? Oh nonono, Jake. That fragile flower is very delicate, okay?    Aaaah! Eric, where are you going? Young man, I am the adult here, and I say you go this way! Young man, I have had it!! Good! You ''deserve'' to die, you little bastard!  Eric, we ''have'' to stay together! No. The Spirit of Maya has told me to go this way. Oh God, this is a ''nightmare!'' We're ''never'' going to make the festival! Let's go, quickly!  Children, it's the Yanagopa.   Run for your lives, children! Run run ruuun!  Waaah! It's quicksand, people!   AAAAA!! All right, that does it!!  I was wrong!! Fuck the rainforest!! I fucking hate it, I fucking hate it!!  Hooray, children! How did you know where we were? Eric? What exactly are you guys doing out here, with all this ...construction equipment? Really?  That's great!! Nooo, I hate the rainforest! You go right ahead and plow down this whole fucking thing! Does everybody remember the new lyrics?  And…
