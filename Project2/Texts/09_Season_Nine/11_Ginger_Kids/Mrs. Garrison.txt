Okay, very nice, Tolkien. Thank you. 'K kids, looks like we only have time for one more speech today, so let's have uh Eric. Kyle, let Eric give his presentation. Kyle, if you wanna debate Eric, you can do so with ''your'' paper tomorrow! Okay, very nice, Kyle. A little dry and science-y for my taste, but there you go.  All right, that's lunch, kids. We'll pick up with Clyde's speech about lesbian cheerleaders after recess.
