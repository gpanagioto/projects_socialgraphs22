All right, good, Timmy. Test 42a is successful. Let's move on to the next phase.  Oh hey fellas, we're doing great. Oh, it's fantastic. This year, Tim-Tim and I are doin' our project on  water bears. Oh, would you like to see them? Timmy and I have gathered thousands of water bears. Take a look in the microscope.  Water bears are water-dwelling, eight-legged micro-animals. They're one of nature's most resilient animals.  Studies have shown they can survive lava, and even the vacuum of space. Where all good scientists learn from. Octonauts. Some scientists believe the study of water bears is key to human survival. Oh, that's easy. You see, for the past several weeks, Tim-Tim and me have been training the water bears to respond to different sound waves. We found that they respond best to Taylor Swift. Hit it, Timmy.  Nathan, it's amazing. The water bears we've trained are starting to display social advancements. They've actually evolved to the point of doing the hokey pokey. Wow, look at this, Tim-Tim. They've all been researching water bears too. That's right. The water bears we've been working with appear to be evolving somehow. Francis, can you hand me the sound wave generator?  Wha-what do you mean, Nathan? Yuh you're not the government? But you said you were here to help stop us from becoming extinct. Oh, I get it. You've been experimenting with water bears to see how to make humans more impervious to concussions.
