I'm going to kill myself.  You guys, Kenny's eating his own hand.  Oh shit, here comes Mr. Mackey.   Nothing. Nothin' Na- Due-nothing.  Gross dude!  No... No, Mr. Mackey... We don't have any cigarettes. We're sorry. Three weeks?! Are you fucking kidding me?  It-it's like the tobacco companies have control of my mind- No. Must. Fight it. Tobacco companies... making me want to smoke. Ah! Why? It's perfect. If everyone's blaming the tobacco companies, then nobody's blaming us. Dumbass, you don't wanna be grounded for three weeks, do you? Got it!   Isn't he awesome, you guys? Dude, he just goes around imposing his will on people. He's my idol.  Handle it? For two billion dollars I'd handle my grandpa's balls, sir.  Which means, if it weren't for tobacco, many of our black friends wouldn't be here today. Wow. It's like, it's like, smoking brings a lot of people just a little bit of joy and, and you get to take that away from them.  You are so awesome. Oh my God, that is what ''I've'' always said.  I love this guy!  Wow, a commercial? God, he's just the best!  Mr. Reiner, can I get you a muffin? O-or a cold drink, perhaps? So, heh gentlemen, looks like only one of us gets to be in the commercial, huh? Who will it be...? Gentlemen, the game is on!  Huh? Oh, I get it, Kyle. That's your Serbian Jew double bluff. Make me think you don't care about being in the commercial so that maybe I won't either. Ooops. didn't work, did it, Kyle? Sure you don't, Kyle. Oh, and neither do I. Oh, I know what you're gonna say next. You're gonna say, "How about none of us show up tomorrow to do it?" And then I'm supposed to agree so that tomorrow you can waltz in all by yourself and do the commercial. That's Serbian Jew double bluff and it ain't  Sorry Kyle, but I'm afraid only one of us will be showing up to do the commercial tomorrow! Hahahaha! Thought you had me with your Serbian Jew double bluff, didn't you?! Well let's see you try to open this door now.   Oh... Hello, Kyle. Oh man.  Wait, this isn't my house. Hahahahahaha!  Nice try, Kyle! Let's see you try to get through the door now! Haa haa hahahahaha!  Heh, okay, okay.  Dead?? Uh what... what does that mean, "I'll be dead"? Hey, uh what, what was that "dead" part? Uh, nnno, thanks. I'm not hungry.  I'm not eating the cupcake.  Jesus Christ! HAAAA! They're going to kill me!  The anti-smoking people! They had me say I died from second-hand smoke and... now they want to sacrifice me to make it look real! They'll stop at nothing!!  You guys have to help me!  Please, you guys, I don't know what to do! If I go, you guys go! Hey, maybe that's it, you guys. Maybe the tobacco company can help us!  Well that's fine. I thought you guys were my friends, but I guess I was wrong!  You guys, I am seriously gettin' pissed off heh! Now come on, we're goin' to the tobacco company!  Aw awww!
