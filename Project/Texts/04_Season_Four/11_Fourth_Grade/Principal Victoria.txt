Oh, this new fourth-grade teacher is driving me nuts! Well, Miss... Choksondik, those children did fairly well in the third grade. Oh? Which one? I'm afraid that's impossible. Nobody's seen Mr. Garrison since the last school year ended.  Whattaya think? Too forward?  Waaah!  As we said before, that's impossible. And then he was accused of trying to solicit sex from a young boy. He finally snapped and had a nervous breakdown and... went up into the mountains to live in solitude. But he could be anywhere up high in those mountains. Mr. Garrison? You admit it? You admit it!  Well, congratulations! Oh. I'm sorry, we don't hire gay people.
