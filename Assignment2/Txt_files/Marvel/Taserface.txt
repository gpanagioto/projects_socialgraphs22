* Taserface is introduced in the live-action film ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]]''. After officially being assigned to direct the film ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' and considering Taserface to be "the dumbest character of all time", director [[James Gunn]] jokingly posted a photo of him on his social media. He later clarified that he would never feature the character in a film. Gunn later changed his mind, and while crafting this character, felt that Taserface had named himself. Hence, he described him as "a real dumbass", yet also "a very powerful guy."<ref name="Taserface">{{cite web|url=http://comicbook.com/2016/07/24/james-gunn-reveals-why-taserface-is-in-guardians-of-the-galaxy-v/|title=James Gunn Reveals Why Taserface Is In Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2|last=Davis|first=Brandon|publisher=Comicbook.com|date=July 24, 2016|accessdate=July 27, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160728120143/http://comicbook.com/2016/07/24/james-gunn-reveals-why-taserface-is-in-guardians-of-the-galaxy-v/|archivedate=July 28, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Discussing the character's look in ''The Art of the Film'', Visual Development Illustrator Anthony Francisco says, "Taserface was described to me as needing to be very scary-looking, but he wants you to think he is the absolute coolest. I translated this into conceptualizing various things he might wear or add onto his Ravager jumpsuit — things that he thinks are badass or interesting. But ultimately, he is just trying too hard."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Johnston |first1=Jacob |title=Marvel's Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2: The Art Of The Movie |date=2019 |publisher=Marvel Entertainment |isbn=9781302500702}}</ref> Feeling that Yondu is "going soft", Taserface leads a mutiny against him and kills anyone still loyal to the former. After [[Kraglin Obfonteri (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Kraglin]] aids Yondu, Rocket, and [[Groot (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Groot]] in escaping from their prison cells, Yondu kills the remaining Ravagers and destroys the main engine, causing the Ravager ship to explode. While the four escape in a smaller escape ship, Taserface contacts the [[Species of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Sovereign|Sovereign]] to give them Yondu's coordinates before dying in the explosion.
* An alternate timeline version of Taserface appears in the [[Disney+]] animated series ''[[What If...? (TV series)|What If...?]]'' episode "[[What If...
