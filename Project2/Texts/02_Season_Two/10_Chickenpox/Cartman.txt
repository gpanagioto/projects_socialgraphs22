No way, dude. Kenny's family's poor; they live in the ghetto. Oh weak! What?  Where is the Nintendo? Oh, good. I'm starving. Pfff..!  What kind of side dishes will we be enjoying this evening with our frozen waffles? Am I to understand there will ''be'' no side dishes? Puh! I heard that. Oh, Jesus, are you fucking kidding me?  Heh, we apparently don't say 'side dishes' at the table, either.  Ey! Man, your family ''sucks ass'', Kenny. Whoever heard of frozen waffles for dinner? It's my Urkel sleeping bag. Isn't it coool? Argh! You have rats in your house, too, Kenny?! Dude, seriously, you'd better stop being so poor, or else I'm gonna start huckin' rocks atcha.  But mom, seriously, it ''itches''. I can't stand it!  Mom, seriously, it itches. It itches! I don't wanna. Ugh. U''un''nh. Ey, give me that! Ahhhh... More calamine lotion! Dammit, where's that calamine lotion?!  Damnit! No, Kitty! That's a-- Wait a minute. Come 'ere, Kitty! Uh. Yes. Uh...  It's about friggin' time! Give me that! Uugh! Yeessss.  Ooohhh yyou guys, seriiously, it calms yer ass. Ahhhh... "I hope that one day America could be more like Endor, where the Ewoks live. Endor is very cool." Mom, answer that! "They have trees and Ewoks, and barbecues, which is why I like Endor more than America. It's cool." I remember frozen waffles with no side dishes. ''She what?!'' That bitch! I'm gonna go downstairs and kick her square in the nuts! We want you to give ''our'' parents herpes. Hell no, you guys get your own! Hey, how come ''you'' don't have sores on ''your'' lips, Ma? Hooray! Well, I know one thing for sure. We're ''all'' gonna need a lot more calamine lotion.
