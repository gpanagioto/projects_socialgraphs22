All right, everyone, I'm turning in for the night. Go to standard security, team 3. What? Barack Obama?   Uh, hello, is there something we can do for you, Mr. Obama? Good, sir. Right now?  Yes sir.  I got a hundred dollars.  Mr. Obama?  Uh, no. No, sir. Everything okay in there? Yes, sir, it's, just that... your wife is here. 
That's enough!  Winter is coming.
