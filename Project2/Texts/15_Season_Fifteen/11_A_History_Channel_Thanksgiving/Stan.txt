We all have to do this report together, dude. Dude, it ''is'' called History Channel. ...What? 'bout what? That... stuffing was never heard of before 1621, so it might be alien technology? Wow, check it out dude, we're on TV.  I don't know, dude. Have you seen that stuff about the pyramids and the link to Mars? I'm just saying there's lots of symbols and signs out there that show aliens and history are pretty linked. Dude! Yeah, go on dude! I didn't think so.  Who's this? Aw, I think he's just kind of pissed off he was wrong about the whole ancient alien thing. It's cool dude, we understand. Wow, there's a lot about Thanksgiving I never knew before.
