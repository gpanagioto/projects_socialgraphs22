We're just having a hard time finding him. We must have just missed him. He was playing at Cherry Creek mall and then Flat Irons mall. Now we don't know where to go because Slash is playing the Pavilion in Colorado Springs in the Gigadome in Moscow later this afternoon. We don't know. He's everywhere. But we have a big deal with EA Sports that depends on it. Dad, is Slash real or make-believe? Slash isn't real. He's made up and people dress like him and pretend to be him to their kids.  Here, look for yourself.  One of our parents. One of our parents!
