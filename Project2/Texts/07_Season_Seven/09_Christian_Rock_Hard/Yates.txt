Shut up!!  You downloaded a lot of songs! Says here you even downloaded Judas Priest? That's hard time you boys are lookin' at. You got anything to say for yourselves?  Not a big deal! You think downloading music for free is not a big deal?! Put your coats on! I'm gonna show you something! And I don't think you're gonna like it! This is the home of Lars Ulrich, the drummer for Metallica.  This month he was hoping to have a gold-plated shark tank bar installed right next to the pool, but thanks to people downloading his music for free, he must now wait a few months before he can afford it.   The Gulfstream III doesn't even have a remote control for its surround-sound DVD system. Still think downloading music for free is no big deal? That is the folly of man. Now look in this window.  I see an island without an owner. If things keep going the way they are, the child will not get his tropical paradise.  Man must learn to think of these horrible outcomes before he acts selfishly or else... I fear... recording artists will be forever doomed to a life of only semi-luxury. It's all right. I think these boys learned their lesson. If you parents will just step over here, you can pay their four hundred dollar release and penalty fees. Not a big deal, huh?! Come with me! I'm gonna show you something! And I don't think you're gonna like it!
