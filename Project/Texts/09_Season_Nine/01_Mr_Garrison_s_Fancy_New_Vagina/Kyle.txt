How can I not be nervous? Trying out for the All-State team has been my dream for years.  Yeah? Yep! I love basketball. I wanna play for the Denver Nuggets one day. Oo whataya mean? I know. I deserve it. You're right.  But I feel like a basketball player. That's all I wanna do.  Mom? Dad? What's a sex-change operation? But our teacher, Mr. Garrison? He just had his penis made into a vagina. How come? Yeah. That's right. Totally! I totally understand! Yeah. My school teacher wanted to be a woman, and you made him into one. Well, do you also do other surgeries like that? No, no, uh I wanna be tall and black. I hate being small and Jewish. I feel like a tall black man. Yeah!  Mom! Dad! I have awesome news! The doctor who gave Mr. Garrison his sex change said he can make me tall and black.  Dr. Biber said he can give me a negroplasty so I can finally look the way I've always wanted. He even took my picture and then did computer imaging to show what I would look like after the surgery.   Can I have three thousand dollars, Mom and Dad, huh?? Can I??  But why not? You said sometimes people need surgery to make them feel better about themselves. Well, all ''my'' life I felt I was black! I've listened to hip-hop, I watch UPN and I love playing basketball! My body doesn't reflect who I am inside. Why? Why do I have to accept it when I can change it? But Jews can't play basketball!   Yeah, but it was totally worth it.  Look, Stan, I'm finally whole! My dad is even gonna take me back down to the all-star game to see if I can try out for the team again!  Alright, Dad!   Coach! Coach, I'm all better. I'm ready to play. Ih it's me, Kyle Broflovski. I had a negroplasty. Can I play in the All-State team now? All right!  I'm a hundred percent ready, coach!  All right!  I got it! I got the ball.  But what about Mr. Garrison? He can't go back.
