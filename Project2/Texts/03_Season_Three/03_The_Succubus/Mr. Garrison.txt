And that, children, is what you need to know about ''The Facts Of Life''. So, let's review.  Sure.  Well children, I ''am'' your teacher.

That's why when it comes to chicks, I just screw them and leave them. I'd say "get out of my bedroom, poontang, before you suck my life dry!" Sure, kids.  Shut your hole, Mr. Hat!  Hoh, wow! You don't see that every day!  Poontang's poontang. <poem><i> And never let poontang come between you and your friend.</i></poem>
