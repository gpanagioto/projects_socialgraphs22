What's Arkansasâ€”is that a state? What's "lose bowel control?" Who's Karen Carpenter? Whoa! Mr. Mackey and Mr. Hat are fighting.  We're not rednecks! Why?! Don't ''you'' know?!  Well keep looking! We gotta find out what it means before we see those New Yorker kids again! Damnit!  You did?  Damnit Cartman, wha-?! Who cares? We have to find out what queef means! Keep reading!  Those New Yorker kids are gonna be here any second, and we still don't know what queef means. No, they'll catch on. Hey, wait a minute. I've got a ''great'' idea. Let's make up our ''own'' word. We can make up a word, and then use it, ...and then they'll act like they know it, and then we'll bust 'em. What word could we make up? No, uhno, not finkleroy. Yeah, mung. Sh. Here they come.  You know what you guys are? You guys are nothing but mung? We busted you!  It is? Ooogh. You dumbass, Cartman! I have no idea. I wish we could find a way to get back at those New Yorker kids. You found what?  No way.  Dude, are you thinking what ''I'm'' thinking? No! That we could use the brown noise to get back at those asshole New Yorker kids. How do we write the note, Cartman? Alright. Now all we do is wipe out the last note on their sheet music, and change it to the note Cartman played.  That should do it. Okay, let's get back to the room.  Dude, I can't wait 'til those New Yorker kids play the brown noise and crap their pants. Oh no, dude. Look!  Stop! Stop!  Yeah, but you know? I learned something today. We were so worried about how cool we looked to those New Yorker kids that we forgot: we're already totally cool, even if we don't know what queef means.   Oh, brother. Let's just get out of here. Uuuuh... You do?
