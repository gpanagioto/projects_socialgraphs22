Tom, Black Friday is finally almost here, and as you can see behind me, holiday shoppers are really getting antsy. People have been waiting out here since midnight on Thanksgiving. They're cold, they're starving, and there's already been a lot of blood shed over these holiday deals. Joining me now is Rick Tellmore,  who's been out here for six days, and your five year old son was eaten. Is that correct? What is it you're hoping to get when Black Friday does finally start? Now, some people might say that eating your child is not very Christmasy. What would you say to them? No doubt Christmas is alive and well at the South Park Mall. Back to you, Tom. That's right Tom. Mall officials have said they are ready, and doors will open as soon as their guest of honor cuts the ceremonial red ribbon.  but uhh, says he is on his way. Just like the dragons and zombies in his novels, he is on his way. Here we go, Tom. George R. R. Martin has finally arrived to cut the red ribbon.  Tom, the shopping frenzy is over, and it looks like Microsoft's new XBox One is this year's hot item. No doubt this will secure its place as the go-to next-gen console. Black Friday is over. There's been death, violence, horrible human behavior... and the big winner here, decidedly, is Channel 9 News.
