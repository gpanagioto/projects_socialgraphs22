Next in line! Come on, let's keep it moving, kids!  Kyle, we're taking pictures without hats today! Alright, class, I have your school photos to hand out- ''Most'' of them are very nice. But, apparently, ''one'' of you thinks it's fun to ''spoil'' their school pictures , and thinks he's a comedian. That person will be spending the afternoon in the principal's office! School photos aren't for joking around, so you aren't getting your photo ''back'', Butters!  For the rest of you, I think your pictures turned out very nicely. Eric, calm down. I'm trying to yell at Butters! You know very well my name isn't Chokesonrocks, it's Choksondik! Say it right or you can go to the principal's with Butters! Your mother is waiting for you in the principal's office.
