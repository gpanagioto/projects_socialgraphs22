Thank you, thank you. Alright let's get started.  I'm getting um, I'm getting M-mike? Definitely an M, d'um, maybe Matt? Mike? Matt? Mi-mmm, Mi-Mike, m-Mary? Okay okay, and she-she's she died? Okay, and she's telling me there's something about... the money. That the, the money is safe? Is that making sense?  Must be from somewhere else in the audience, then. Uh, d'uh, money? Is someone el- Uh d'eh'hm quiet, quiet down boys. It doesn't work that way. Uh, okay, I I'm getting ...someone now whose name is g-, a t-. It's an l-, it's a m-, it's k-. Kenny says hi. Okay, now I'm getting that Kenny ...died? And, and this wasn't, this wasn't a good death. It was like a, it was a ''sad'' death. It was like a, it was like a death that made people sad. Does that make sense?  Now, Kenny is telling me that... you're his best friends, and he's in a ss-safe place. Ohh, there's somebody with him. Who's Kyle? Oh right. And uh, did an older woman pass, she's asking for Kyle? Maybe a grandma? She says there was something she asked you to do, and you're not doing it? She wants you to look for four white doves. Oh now she's sending me a P word. Maybe it's a puh-? Or a huh-? Oh, it's comin' from over here.  Okay now Harry. He's telling me... oh well, he's saying that you two used to... do things. And that those things involved... stuff? Thank you, thank you. Oh.  Maybe it ''is'' for real. Look, people have the right to be skeptical. I really hear voices in my head. Look, what I do doesn't hurt anybody. I give people closure and help them cope with life. But I'm a psychic. I'm not a douche! What if I really believe that dead people talk to me? I think I've had of your bullying me! Get out of my house or I'll runs upstairs, lock myself in my panic room and call the police! I'm not talking to your friend and I'm not a douche!  So, you think you can talk to dead people better than me, huh?! They told me your show is getting better ratings than mine, that you're saying I'm a fraud on your show! You'd better not ever call me a liar, or a fake, or a douche again, or else I'll ''sue'' you for slander! Everything I tell people is positive and gives them hope! How does ''that'' make ''me'' a douche?! I'M NOT A DOUCHE! And I challenge you to a psychic showdown! I'll prove to the world that I'm psychic and you're not! I'm not a douche!  Thank you.  Alright, asshole! I know you're here to try to throw me off, so go ahead. Give me your best shot! Wah-why? But I ''do'' have a special power! I know I do! God-damnit, I'm special!!  Why that... that's me!  What?! No, wait! I'm not a douche! I make people feel good about themselves!  I'm not a douche!
