The character's original storyline was about a mysterious stone tablet coveted by several ''Spider-Man'' villains. The "Tablet Saga" proved popular, although artist [[John Romita, Sr.]] said that it was not originally intended as an arc: "We never even thought up Silvermane until the seventh issue [of the story arc], let alone a 'socko' ending."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wells |first1=John |title=American Comic Book Chronicles: 1965-1969 |date=2014 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1605490557 |page=270}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Silvio Manfredi, nicknamed "Silvermane" for his near-white hair, is a professional [[criminal]] originally from [[Corleone]], [[Sicily]] that started his criminal career as a racketeer in the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]], eventually forming his own crime family and becoming a powerful Maggia Don.

In his first appearance, an elderly Silvermane forced [[Lizard (comics)|Dr. Curt Connors]] to make a potion from an ancient clay tablet in order to grant himself immortality. He first crossed paths with Conners's alter-ego, the Lizard, and [[Spider-Man]] during this scheme. Drinking the serum made Silvermane younger, but its effects caused him to de-age further and further until he was a infant before completely disappearing.<ref>''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #73-75. marvel Comics.</ref> Silvermane eventually reappeared, revealing that he had mystically aged to his forties. He started a new career and again quickly rose through the Maggia's ranks until he regained control of his family, the sought to form an alliance with [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]], determined to take over the world as their leader, the Supreme Hydra. He was defeated by [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], [[Nick Fury]] and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]<ref>''Daredevil'' #121-123. Marvel Comics.</ref> Silvermane reappeared in New York in an attempt to unite all of New York's gangs under his leadership and take over the criminal underworld, but his plans were complicated by the [[Green Goblin#Bart Hamilton|Green Goblin]], who opposed him. During a confrontation between the Goblin, Silvermane and Spider-Man, Silvermane fell from a great height but survived.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #176-180. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Silvermane has worked with many super-villains, such as [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]], and he has also been known to be a rival of the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]], even once trying to assassinate the crime lord while he was suffering from amnesia.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #197. Marvel Comics.</ref> His former partner, Dominic Tyrone, assumed the identity of the [[Rapier (comics)|Rapier]] and sought vengeance against Silvermane for betraying him by attempting to take his life.<ref>''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]] Annual'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> A flashback one-shot focused heavily on Silvermane's lifetime of corruption and crime, going back to his early career in Italy. The framework was reporter [[Ben Urich]] investigating the background of the Maggia. He learned that Silvermane was a legendary criminal figure for decades; mothers would even warn their children to behave or "One-Eye" would get them.<ref>''Spider-Man: Made Men'' #1 (August 1998). Marvel Comics.</ref>

In his old age, Silvermane's injuries caused his youth serum to wear off, rendering him an invalid. Though bedridden, he continued to run his criminal empire until [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Dagger]] nearly killed him. Silvermane attempted to prolong his life by transforming himself into a [[cyborg]].<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #69-70. Marvel Comics.</ref> Kingpin gained control of his cyborg body until Dagger restored his life energy to him.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #94-96. Marvel Comics.</ref> His cyborg body was badly damaged by the first [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]] during a gang war between Hammerhead and the Kingpin.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #284. Marvel Comics.</ref> Silvermane used a remote-controlled android doppelganger to battle Spider-Man. This was part of an attempt to boost the power of his remaining organic parts by harvesting new ones from Spider-Man's body. He attempted to drain his nemesis's radioactive blood to power a new, much stronger cyborg body.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #79-80. Marvel Comics.</ref> Silvermane also confronted [[Deathlok]] and the [[Punisher]] while setting up a major drug operation outside a grammar school.<ref>''Deathlok'' #8-9. Marvel Comics.</ref> Even though he is no longer technically human, he has continued to remain active in the Maggia.

Silvermane attempted to take part in a meetup of various criminal warlords, during a time when Wilson Fisk had fallen from power. The meeting's goal was to divide up Fisk's territory and assets, but it did not go well. Silvermane was caught in the crossfire between the [[Secret Empire (organization)|Secret Empire]]'s forces and the Punisher. This was purely by coincidence as he was simply staying at the same motel as Punisher was. Silvermane used the resources of his personal semi-trailer and the cyborg bodies stored within to battle his way through the attackers and escape.<ref>''Punisher War Journal'' #46-48. Marvel Comics.</ref>

It was revealed some time later that Silvermane was killed during a shootout with [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]]'s gang at a New York City scrap yard. He was picked up by a magnet and dropped into a garbage compactor, crushing him to death and leaving his already weakened criminal syndicate without a leader. Months later, he apparently returns along with other deceased members of his gang during the Maggia's losing battle with the forces of [[Mister Negative]]. However, this is later revealed to be a ruse orchestrated by a mobster named Carmine: "Silvermane" is actually a lifelike robotic duplicate controlled by a hired [[Mysterio]] to give Carmine more influence within the Maggia and position him to take over. The tables are turned on Carmine when Mysterio uses the duplicate to murder him, seemingly as a plot to take over the Maggia himself.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #618-620. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Silvermane's head is shown to still be alive as it was found by a young boy when he traveled into the scrap yard, before then being stolen by the [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]].<ref>''The Superior Foes of Spider-Man'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> The head is used as leverage by [[The Superior Foes of Spider-Man]] to take control of the Maggia, but the team members turn on each other when it comes time to decide who will actually be in charge. Shocker protects Silvermane from the [[Punisher]]. In return, the crime boss nominates him as his successor to head the Maggia.<ref>''The Superior Foes of Spider-Man'' #17. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Silvermane is among the crime lords competing with Mister Negative in obtaining the Tablet of Life and Destiny in order to win the favor of Mayor Wilson Fisk.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #59. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Silvermane is considered one of the Maggia's most legendary bosses. He was a superb hand-to-hand combatant, an excellent marksman, and a brilliant strategist and organizer. The use of magical potions temporarily granted him a form of immortality, allowing him to appear as a man in his early-to-mid 40s. His preferred weapons included various handguns and the Thompson .45 caliber machine gun. Later, Silvermane's brain, vital organs, and head were transplanted into a cyborg body, increasing his physical abilities and granting him superhuman strength and senses. However, Silvermane's remaining organic body parts are those of an elderly man, and thus extremely vulnerable.

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Marvel===
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of Silvermane had a brief cameo. With [[Kingpin (character)|Wilson Fisk]] lying low due to legal problems, Silvermane, his chief rival, decided to work with fellow mobster [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] to remove the Kingpin from power. He told Hammerhead that all he needed was a little "up here" (referring to his intelligence). Hammerhead, however, wasn't interested in sharing power, breaking Silvermane's neck while saying "I think I got enough up here already."<ref name="auto">''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #79. Marvel Comics.</ref> Silvermane was also mentioned as a leader of a mob family which included Hammerhead and that he owed a debt to [[Mister Sinister|Nathaniel Essex]].<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #14 (March 2002). Marvel Comics.</ref> The Ultimate incarnation's real name is shown in the ''Daily Bugle'' as '''Allan Silvermane''', though this is likely an alias as he is also referred to as Silvio Manfredi.<ref name="auto"/>

===House of M===
Silvermane appeared in the ''[[House of M]]'' reality, portrayed as a younger crime boss and one of dozens of mobsters captured by the NYPD's elite [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood]] unit.<ref>''House of M: Avengers'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

As of the episode "Opening Night", Silvermane was remanded to the [[Vault (Marvel Comics)|Vault]].

===Novels===
Silvermane appears in the novel ''Spider-Man: Forever Young'', written by [[Stefan Petrucha]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The details of the tablet story are retold, with some elements being updated or changed, such as Silvermane displaying a disdain for personal electronic devices due to their lack of security as well as the Kingpin being left in a coma due to the shock of learning that his son was the masked criminal, the Schemer. The novel picks up two years after the original storyline, with Silvermane now randomly aging from childhood to adulthood as he attempts to force Curt Connors and Spider-Man to retrieve the tablet and stabilize his condition. Even after Connors's research asserts that the tablet essentially cycles someone through their reincarnations in one lifetime to try to achieve true [[karma]], Silvermane refuses to accept this and attempts to blackmail Spider-Man to help him after deducing his true identity. Spider-Man eventually confronts Silvermane in the latter's church hideout. The ensuing battle ends with an enraged Silvermane burning the church down to try to kill Spider-Man, though his ultimate fate is left unclear.
