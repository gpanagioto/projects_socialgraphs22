 Why?! Why are you happy for me?! Nothing!   No!  No!  AAA! Where is everybody? What's goin' on?? Hey! In here!  Don't worry. It's gonna be okay. We've got water, and, and maybe somebody even left some food laying around. Come on.  Oh... Good. It sure was. Yeah. Now that it's over, I... I guess it was kind of fun.  I'd like that.  Hey Nichole. Sure!  What's up? Oh. Okay... I think... you're really great. Yeah. I'm sorry too. I'll see you around.  Yeah. Yeah, I guess.  Yeah. Yeah, we're through.  Hi. I'm sorry too. I wouldn't even talk to you at first because you were black.  There are still people who will look at us funny. And think we're supposed to be together. I don't care, either.  YAY!
