Hello, Satan!   Did you miss me, buttercup? ''Yeah'', you killed me. So? Where was I gonna go? Detroit? Come on, guy. Just let me in so we can talk. Satan, look: I know our relationship wasn't perfect. Okay? I know that. I was too busy tryin' to take over the world to give you what you needed. But I've changed, Satan.  COME ON, can't we just go out for a burrito?  Â¡Me gusta burrito mucho! Who?? Screw 'im! He can't pound your ass like I can! Wait. Wait, I'm sorry, heh. But Satan, you can't deny what's between us.  You can try, but you ''know we belong'' together.  And you must be Mr. Assface.  Yeah! Hey, relax, guy. We're all here to act like adults, right?  Hn-yeah, those were the days, boy. What the hell ''is'' this crap we're eating, anyway? Oh, isn't that fascinating. So, tell me, Chris. How is it that you died? An escalator? What kind of pussy way of dying is that?! Uh huh. Yes. I guess I should be gettin' back.  Yeah. Thanks for the weak grass and twigs and stuff.  Satan, that guy is a pussy! Yes, that's what I said! He's a pussy! For some people, maybe. But ''you'' like excitement. I know you, Satan.  Here.  I'm at the bargain hotel on Monte Vista. Room 16. D'oh, I know you won't. But just keep it, just in case. It was good seeing you again, Satan. Goodnight.  Goodnight, pussy! I mean, Chris!
