You mean you don't know? Last year's national champions were the Austin Pirates. They played China for the world championship. Only four of them came back alive. Chinese dodgeball players aren't like us.  They do nothing but dodgeball, day in, and day out. They use steroids and advanced training equipment to make them, not kids, but animals. Well, good luck. We've got our futures to think about.
