'''''NFL SuperPro''''' is a short-lived [[comic book]] series published by [[Marvel Comics]], centered on '''Phil Grayfield''', an ex-[[National Football League]] (NFL) player who survives a freak accident and wears a near-indestructible [[American football|football]] uniform. Produced in collaboration with the NFL and originally written by [[Fabian Nicieza]] and artist Jose Delbo, the series started publication in 1991 and ended after 12 issues.<ref name=regrettable>{{cite book |last1=Morris |first1=Jon |title=The League of Regrettable Superheroes: Half Baked Heroes from Comic Book History |date=2015 |publisher=Quirk Books |location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |isbn=978-1-59474-763-2 |pages=224–225}}</ref>

==Outline==
Nicieza wrote a story centering on Phil Grayfield, once an aspiring football player. His career ended when he saved a child from falling and suffered a horrific knee injury. He became a [[sports reporter]] and interviewed an eccentric football [[Fan (person)|superfan]], who also happened to be a scientist. This scientist designed a new, almost indestructible football uniform, which has to be molded on an individual basis and costs five million dollars to construct — so it is worth a fortune.

Suddenly interrupting the interview, thieves raid the superfan's house, overwhelm the two of them, steal a van load of [[Sports memorabilia|NFL merchandise]] (but not the uniform), and torch the building. Grayfield, who is tied up, knocks over experimental chemicals, which — in combination with the fire and ultra-rare football souvenirs going up in flames — do not incinerate him, but turn him into a near-invincible superhero.

Grayfield puts on the superfan's football uniform and brings the villains to justice, dedicating his life to fighting crime and dubbing himself "SuperPro".

==Publication history==
The first issue starring NFL SuperPro was "''NFL SuperPro Special Edition # 1''", cover-dated March 1991. The series began with issue "''NFL SuperPro # 1''" (cover-date October 1991) and ended with "''NFL SuperPro # 12''" (cover-date September 1992). On two occasions, ''NFL SuperPro'' featured a crossover,  a common practice in comic books to boost sales; [[Spider-Man]] (in issue # 1) and [[Captain America]] (in issue # 8).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.atomicavenue.com/atomic/TitleDetail.aspx?TitleID=4958|title= NFL SuperPro|author= |date= |publisher= atomicavenue.com|accessdate= 25 August 2013}}</ref>

The character NFL SuperPro has not been seen since the demise of the series. Writer [[Robert Kirkman]] reportedly wanted to use SuperPro in an issue of ''[[Marvel Team-Up#Marvel Team-Up vol. 3|Marvel Team-Up]]'' but could not, due to copyright concerns. The closest he came was ''Marvel Team-Up'' #9, in which the character [[Stilt-Man]] says, "I beat up a guy called SuperPro last week. Silliest looking guy...".

==Reception==
''NFL SuperPro'' has been called one of the worst comics in recent [[Marvel Comics]] history, becoming a cult object. Often cited in this claim are issues with the plot and the characters. For example, in the first issue a group of thieves incinerate valuable NFL merchandise but it is never explained why they burn it instead of selling it off. Writer [[Fabian Nicieza]] has admitted he wrote the story to gain free NFL tickets.<ref name=Vice>[https://sports.vice.com/en_us/article/twenty-five-years-ago-the-nfl-and-marvel-created-nfl-superproand-it-sucked Twenty-Five Years Ago, the NFL and Marvel Created 'NFL SuperPro'—and It Sucked], by Alex Wong, at [[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]; published September 21, 2016; retrieved May 11, 2017</ref><ref name=Sims>[http://comicsalliance.com/nfl-superpro-comic-football-superhero/ Happy Thanksgiving From NFL Superpro, the Football Superhero], by Chris Sims, at [[ComicsAlliance]]; published November 25, 2009; retrieved May 11, 2017</ref><ref name=Lamar>[http://io9.gizmodo.com/5691744/10-ridiculous-superheroes-who-are-their-jobs 10 ridiculous superheroes who are their jobs], by Cyriaque Lamar, at [[Io9]]; published November 16, 2010; retrieved May 11, 2017</ref> He stated that he still receives flak for the comic.

Nicieza left ''SuperPro'' after four issues, and was replaced with [[Buzz Dixon]]; one of Dixon's issues, which featured [[Hopi]] villains who used [[kachina]]-themed costumes and weapons, drew substantial complaints from Hopi representatives, leading Marvel to officially recall the comic.<ref name=Vice/><ref name=Urban>[http://www.cbr.com/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-89/ Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #89], by Brian Cronin, at [[Comic Book Resources]]; published February 8, 2007; retrieved May 11, 20127</ref> Dixon left ''Superpro'' after three issues.<ref name=Urban/>

In 2005, the Chicago Sports Review called it "perhaps the worst comic book ever created".<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070926225323/http://www.chicagosportsreview.com/news/newsview.asp?c=142691 The Top 10 Sports/Comic Book Crossovers], at Chicago Sports Review (via [[archive.org]]); published February 3, 2005; retrieved May 11, 2017</ref>
