You boys...better not be on that computaaaaaaah! I'll make you pay for this. You locked your mother in the pantry? I'll lock you in your rooms forevaaah. -ah!  Ike!  You dare lock me in the pantry, so you can play on your computer?!  You're gonna pay for what you have done! Ike!  You...! You helped turned your brother this way! Shut up! Not another word from either of you! You're both grounded from the computer...forever!  Do you think I'm stupid?! You both march out of here, right now! Laura, have my boys come to see Craig? They're hiding from me. What? What? What? I don't know what you're talking about. May I use this a moment? There's nothing here. Maybe Kyle was telling the truth.  Oh Laura! I think my boys were being honest with me. I accused Ike of...of...well, I can't really say, but this thing says that he's clean. I got to find my boys, Laura. Thank you so much.  No, I-I have to respect Gerald's privacy. I shouldn't do this.  What the hell just happened?!
