South Park, school bus stop, morning. Stan, Cartman and Kenny wait for the bus. Stan is dressed in fishnet tank top, artsy pants, and a new, furry cap with the same colors as his old one. Cartman is dressed in a Madonna fashion shirt and artsy pants. His hair is tussled and brighter than usual. Kenny is dressed in a purple parka with light purple sleeves. A lock of his hair peeks out from under the hood.

Stan

Oh my God, you guys are not gonna believe what happened to me last night.

Cartman

What? Tell us?

Stan

So, I'm watching the season premiere of Boy Meets Boy on television, and then Queer Eye for the Straight Guy comes on, right? So I fall asleep in front of the TV, and when I wake up, I see that I've spilled the Coke I was drinking all over my satin pajama top.

Cartman

Oh my Gosh, are you serious? That was the cutest top ever!

Stan

I know!

Kenny

(I just LOVE this jacket 'cause it's SOOO beautiful!)

Stan

Oh, tell me about it, Ken doll.

Kyle

[joins them, but dressed as usual] Hey dudes. [the others glance at him]

Cartman

[begins to laugh at him] What a dork!

Kyle

What?

Cartman

Nice jacket, Kyle! Polyester is really the hot fabric this fall! [laughs heartily]

Kyle

Well, but, this is the jacket I always wear.

Stan

You've gotta get with the times, girlfriend.

Cartman

Yeah, that jacket is so September 10th. [Stan inspects Kyle's jacket]

Stan

Oohh my God, you got splotches on your neck. Are you using any exfoliating products at all??

Cartman

We can't let Kyle out in public like this, you guys.

Kenny

(That's the truth.)

Stan

Come on, Kyle! We're giving you a makeover! [the boys excitedly pull Kyle along to South Park Mall]

The Broflovski house. Gerald and Sheila watch TV from their couch

Announcer

Coming up on HBC, it's Queer Eye for the Straight Guy!

Carson

[a shot of Queer Eye...] We have got to get you some tighter-fitting shirts!

Announcer

[the night's schedule pops up over the scene] Then it's Boy Meets Boy, followed by Will and Grace, and then, the Love Boat... with Men.

Sheila

My goodness, there certainly are a lot of gay shows on television these days.

Gerald

Yeah. I think it's great that gays are finally being so accepted. [the door opens and the four newly-clothed boys enter]

Kyle

[waves] Hi Mom, Hi Dad!

Gerald

[looks and screams, then walks over to Kyle] Kyle! What's happened to you??

Kyle

I'm just trying to fit in, Daddy. Don't be such a drama queen! [leads the others boys out of the living room]

Gerald

Oh my God! Come on, Sheila! [she rises] We'd better go tell the other parents what's going on!! [they leave.]

-----


The Marsh house. Gerald is pounding on the front door and Sharon answers.

Sharon

Oh hi Gerald, Sheila.

Gerald

Hi Sharon. Uh, we need to talk to you about the boys.

Sharon

Sure. Come on in. The guys are all watching TV.

Gerald

Oh, is the game on or something? [they move towards the sofa, where a bunch of the men are watching]

Randy

[moves over to Gerald and hugs him] Heeey Geraaald! How are youuuu!! [the other men greet him as well]

Other Men

Geraaald! Hi Gerald.

Stuart

Sit down, Jer-Jer! Queer Eye For the Straight Guy is on.

Gerald

Oh no! Y-you guys all turned gay too?? [the other men laugh]

Randy

Not gay, Gerald, metrosexual.

Gerald

What's that?

Skeeter

Just because a guy cares about how he looks and is in touch with his feminine side doesn't mean he's gay anymore.

Stuart

Yeah. Metrosexual means you're straight, but you appreciate the gay culture.

Randy

It's super-fabulous. Would you like some shirazz?

-----


The ladies look on from the kitchen.

Sharon

Don't our men look 

Linda

Haven't you seen Queer Eye For the Straight Guy, Sheila? These five gay men go around and show straight men how to better themselves. It's the best.

Sheila

It is?

Sharon

Well sure, Sheila. Our husbands are all so clean and neat. My Randy irons his clothes and even has pedicures.

Linda

And they like to talk about their feeling now and drink wine and decorate the house.

Sarah

My Steven shaved his chest and his balls. Oooh, I love it!

Sharon

And how about our boys, huh? Ever since gay culture became cool, our boys bathe every night and brush their teeth three times a day. This is the greatest thing ever.

Sheila

I don't know. Sometimes boys take cultural fads too far...

-----


South Park, day. The boys go to school in their new threads. They stop at the main entrance.

Stan

Dude, I can't wait for Wendy to see how gay I look!

Cartman

That's true, you guys. When the chicks at school see how gay we are, they're gonna be all over us.

Kenny

(Woohoo!!)

Stan

All right. Let's work it! [shimmies a bit. The boys turn and pass through the entrance, but stop in their tracks.] What the...?

Butters

Tootaloo, Connor. See ya after classes.

Connor

Okay, sweetums. [they part ways. Butters goes off to his right. Farther away, near the drinking fountains, stand Timmy, Jimmy, Kevin, and Pip]

Clyde

Oh my God, where is my homework?! I am freaking out! [turns right and follows after Butters. The boys look on in stunned silence]

A boy

Hey dudes. [the boys look and it's Craig with Tolkien, Jason, and Tweek]

Stan

Hey Craig.

Craig

You guys look pretty gay.

Kyle

[happily] Thanks.

Craig

[him and his group are not happy about it] Not as gay as us, though.

Cartman

[moves in front of Kyle] Oh, please Craig, we're ten times gayer than you!

Craig

Oh yeah?! We're super duper triple-dog gay!

Cartman

Oh yeah?! We're all ultra super stamp it stamp it no erasies mega gay!

Chef

[arrives] What's all this fightin' about, children?!

Stan

These guys are trying to say they're gayer than us!

Chef

Aw nah. Don't tell me you children have taken up this whole metrosexual fad, too.

Stan

Oh My God, this is not a fad, this is who we are!

Chef

No it isn't. Last year you children were all trying to be black, and now you're trying to be gay!

Stan

We're metrosexual!!

Craig

Maybe. But you'll never be as metrosexual as us! Come on, fags! [snaps his fingers and his group follows him away]

Cartman

GOD I HATE CRAIG!! [Stan and Kenny turn to leave] That son of a... djah!! [leaves. Kyle turns to leave, but has second thoughts.]

Kyle

Chef, I don't feel very metrosexual.

Chef

Well, then, don't buy into this fad, Kyle. Be who you are, not what's cool.

-----


Mr. Garrison's class, next day. He enters. On the blackboard are two math problems: one addition, one subtraction.

Mr. Garrison

All right children, let's take our seats.

Class

[in unison] Good morning Mr. Garrison. [their dulcet tones get his attention, and he turns around]

Mr. Garrison

Well, uh d-don't you all look nice.

Timmy

[responds, gestures gaily with his hands] Oooo, Timmy. [the door opens and Kyle enters. A closeup of the boys as Kyle goes to his seat]

Stan

Dude! W-what are you doing?

Kyle

I didn't feel comfortable in that stuff, dude. I'm just being me.

Craig

HA! Told you you guys were straight!

Stan

We're not straight! You're straight!

Jason, Craig, Tweek, Tolkien

You're straight!

Cartman

You're straight like a freeway!

Mr. Garrison

What the hell is going on??

Cartman

You wish you were gay, Craig! In you dreams!!

Craig

I'm not just gay, I'm a catamite. [Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny stay silent, looking at each other]

Cartman

...So? I'm half bisexual!

Mr. Garrison

Oh, stop it!! You kids don't even know what you're talking about!! Eric, you're not half-bi!!

Cartman

I'm like, a quarter-bi. My grandpa was bi, so that makes me quarter-bi.

Mr. Garrison

WHAT??

-----


Nighttime. Mr. Garrison and Mr. Slave walk down the street.

Mr. Garrison

It was the craziest thing I've ever seen, Mr. Slave. All the children were suddenly acting like being gay was cool. I mean, maybe we're not the only gay couple in town anymore. [they cross the cross street and enter the bar at the corner]

Mr. Slave

Oh, Jesus Christ.

-----


The bar, inside. Disco music is playing. Mr. Garrison looks in awe at the metrosexuals now milling about.

Mr. Garrison

Look at that, Mr. Slave. [a pan shot of the people there. He puts his hands over his mouth] Our cup runneth over.

Mr. Slave

[puts his right hand over his mouth] Jesus Christ.

Jimbo

[standing with Ned at the bar] Mr. Garrison, those are great pants.

Mr. Garrison

Thanks, Jimbo. I really like your outfit, too. [cuddles up to him] Soho... so Jimbo, you... wanna come back to my place with me and Mr. Slave?

Jimbo

Uh, for what?

Mr. Garrison

Well, you know...

Jimbo

No.

Mr. Garrison

Huh.

Randy

Mr. Garrison! [Garrison and Slave walk over] Hey doll.

Mr. Garrison

Oh hey Randy.

Randy

You're looking ultra-fabulous.

Mr. Garrison

Well thanks. You too. [leans in a bit] So uh, Randy, you want me to give you a hand job in the bathroom?

Randy

[turns his back to Mr. Garrison and walks away] Nuno, thanks, I'm, I'm not like that.

Mr. Garrison

Not, not like that?

Richard

[approaches, carries some glasses of wine] How about some shirazz, guys? [Garrison and Slave each take a glass]

Mr. Garrison

Uh-Oh, thanks, Mr. Tweek.

Richard

My pleasure, silly-buns.

Mr. Garrison

Oh, wuh, well uh, Mr. Tweek, why don't we uh, go back to my place.

Richard

Why?

Mr. Garrison

Well, you know, I was just thinking we could... put on some music and watch videos and pound Mr. Slave's tight little ass.

Mr. Slave

Woohoohoohoo, Jesus Christ.

Richard

Wohohoho, goodness no. I, I'm straight.

Mr. Garrison

Straight? Bu-uh, Oh what... Jesus, what the hell is goin' on here?!

Patrons

Huh?

Mr. Garrison

Why won't anybody pound Mr. Slave's butt?!

Randy

Well, we don't "pound butt," Mr. Garrison, we're straight.

Mr. Garrison

Those pants and those shoes say you pound butt!!

Jimbo

Hey, now that's not true. My shoes don't say I pound butt.

Mr. Garrison

No, your shoes say you take it in the butt!!

Skeeter

So, Mr. Garrison. We learned that gays are totally cool. You're just one of us now.

Patrons

Yeah.

Mr. Garrison

One of you?! [throws his glass down] We've spent our whole lives tryin' NOT to be one of you! You can't do this to us!!

-----


South Park Elementary, playground, day.

Cartman

Have you guys seen this? It's a conditioner that you can leave in, and it detoxifies the scalp.

Stan

Wow, is that from Origins?

Cartman

Yeah. It's a charcoal-based thing that-

Kyle

[approaches with a football] Hey guys. You wanna throw the football around?

Cartman

Guys, can I talk to you over here for a second? [pulls Stan and Kenny away from Kyle] Look, guys, a lot of the kids in school are talking, okay? And they're spreading rumors that we're not metrosexuals because... we hang out with Kyle.

Stan

Well, what can we do about it?

Cartman

We have no choice, you guys. We're just gonna have to kill Kyle.

Stan

What?? That's stupid. We wouldn't have to kill Kyle! We would just to tell him not to hang around us anymore.

Cartman

Oh, you know, you're right, Stan. We just have to tell Kyle not to hang around us anymore.

Stan

Yeah. Wait, what?

Cartman

You hear that, Kenny? Stan thinks we should tell Kyle not to hang around us anymore. I think he's right. Good luck telling him, Stan. I... know it won't be easy.

Craig

[approaches with his friends] Hey, butch boy. Nice football you got there. [they laugh at him]

Tolkien

When was the last time you had a manicure, straight man? [Kyle picks up his football]

Jason

Yeah, let's see that hair. [lifts up Kyle's hat] Look, he's not even using any product! [he and the others laugh at him. Other boys gather in and join in the laughter]

Stan

[returns with Cartman and Kenny] Hey, what's goin' on?

Craig

Oh, here come the butch boys to help their butchy little friend!

Cartman

He's not our friend. [Stan's jaw drops a bit. Cartman looks at Stan and walks away. Kenny follows]

Kyle

Stan? [Stan looks at Kyle, sighs, and walks away]

Jason

[shoves Kyle a bit] This playground is for metrosexuals, macho man!

Craig

Take your non-flaming ass to some other school! [the other boys gather round Kyle and gang up on him]

Kyle

No! Ah!

-----


South Park sign, now with a bed of flowers under it.

-----


The Broflovski house. Kyle returns with bruises all over his body. His mom is dusting.

Sheila

[sees him and drops her duster to kneel next to him] Kyle! What happened to you?!

Kyle

[sniffs] I got beat up at school... for being different.

Sheila

WHAT?? Your classmates beat you up for being a Jew?

Kyle

No! For not being a metrosexual.

Sheila

Gerald! Gerald, get down here!

Gerald

[upstairs. Disco music plays] Here I come! [dances down the stairs, then moonwalks right back up, then strikes a pose.]

Kyle

Oh no! Dad's metrosexual too?

Gerald

Kyle! You look terrible! [walks down and approaches him]

Sheila

The boys at school beat him up, Gerald.

Gerald

Oh, really?! Well, don't you worry, Kyle. We can cover that black eye up with some cream base, and the coat and pants we'll bleach with an acid wash for a fun vintage look.

Kyle

Gah! Just leave me alone! [walks away and passes the TV]

A voice

There you go! Now you look fabulous.

Kyan

You see that? A spray-on tan does wonders for your look.

Kyle

GRRRRR!!

Thom

Now let's get down to the tango class and learn some new steps. [the straight man smiles]

Kyle

That does it! I know what I have to do! [walks off]

-----


Chef's house, day. Mr. Garrison rings the bell.

Chef

Oh, hello, Mr. Garrison.

Mr. Garrison

[sadly] Chef, can I talk to you?

Chef

Sure. Come on in.

Mr. Garrison

Thanks. Come, Slave. [yanks Mr. Slave in by a leash around his neck. Both men sit on Chef's couch. Mr. Slave buries his face in his hands] Oh, it's just awful, Chef! I used to feel like an outsider, a totally different person who stood out in this town! Now every straight guy is acting gayer than me!

Mr. Slave

[sobs] Oh Jesus! Jesus Christ!

Chef

Well, what do you want me to do about it?

Mr. Garrison

Chef, what did you do when white people stole your culture?

Chef

Oh. Well, we black people just always tried to stay out in front of them.

Mr. Slave

[straightens up] How did you do that?

Chef

Well, like with our slang. Black people always used to say, "I'm in the house" instead of "I'm here." But then white people all started to say "in the house" so we switched it to "in the hizzouse." Hizzouse became hizzizzouse, and then white folk started saying that, and we had to change it to hizzie, then "in the hizzle" which we had to change to "hizzle fo shizzle," and now, because white people say "hizzle fo shizzle," we have to say "flippity floppity floop."

Mr. Garrison

[slumps forward] We don't have time for all that, Chef! Oh, if only those Queer Eye For the Straight Guy people understood what they were doing. [thinks] Wait. [rises] That's it! I know exactly what to do! [yanks on Mr. Slave's leash] Come on, Mr. Slave! Let's get back to our flippity floppity floop. [exits the front door with Mr. Slave]

Chef

Oh no! Damnit! Don't call it that! [the door closes]

-----


South Park Train Station. Kyle approaches a ticket booth.

Kyle

One ticket to New York, please.

Clerk

[handing a ticket over] You're going to New York alone?

Kyle

I'm going to see the Queer Eye For the Straight Guy people.

Clerk

Oooo, great idea! They can help you with those dated clothes.

Kyle

Mrrh.

-----


 Kyle walks away, then unsheathed a sharp knife. He enters the train. Inside, he walks down the aisle until he sees a bench. He hops onto it and sits down. A few seconds later, he notices the two men to his left, then looks up in recognition: they are Mr. Garrison and Mr. Slave. Mr. Garrison is carrying his own knife.

Kyle

Mr. Garrison?

Mr. Garrison

Kyle, what are you doing here?

Kyle

I'm going to New York to kill the Queer Eye For the Straight Guy people!

Mr. Garrison

What?? That's what I'm doing!

Kyle

Oh no! They ruined my life! I get to kill them first!

Mr. Garrison

They took gay culture from real gays and their asses are ours!

Kyle

I thought of it first!

Mr. Garrison

No you didn't! No you didn't!

Kyle

Did so! Did so!

Mr. Garrison

I thought of it yesterday!

Kyle

I thought of it two days ago!

Mr. Garrison

I thought of it before you were born!

Mr. Slave

Stop it, you two! Stop it! Don't you see how crazy this is?

Mr. Garrison

Oh. [sigh] You're right, Mr. Slave. We can both kill them together.

Kyle

Cool.

-----


South Park Mall, day. The boys are at a clothing store.

Stan

Wow, we look great!

Cartman

Yeah, and let's see Craig out gay us now.

Randy

Boys! Boys! Come on! There's a sale down in Express for Men! [leaves. The boys follow him out. Randy calls out to the other men in the mall] Hey guys! There's a sale in Express for Men! [their wives sit on benches in the center of the mall with nothing to do]

Richard

Oh my God!

Man

Let's go! Let's go!

Ryan

[walking down the far side of the mall] You guys have got to see these shoes I bought!

Gerald

Hurry, you guys! The mall closes in seven hours!

Jimbo

Oh, why can't we all live at the mall?!

Sharon

You know, I'm starting to think this whole metrosexual thing isn't so great.

Linda

I know what you mean. All my husband ever does now is look at himself in the mirror. He cares more about how he looks than how I look.

Mrs. Tweek

I hope something happens soon to put an end to this whole fad.

-----


HBC Television Headquarters, New York. The head of programming is with the Queer Eye guys.

Head of Programming

Guys, you've done a terrific job. Queer Eye For the Straight Guy is our number one show! [the guys cheer]

Carson

What can I say? We're fabulous.

Head of Programming

You guys are changing the world! And tomorrow, we're gonna have you make over the President of the United States!

Jai

Oh my God, I think I'm gonna faint. [a knock is heard at the door, then it opens]

Mr. Garrison

Room service. [a service cart rolls in]

Head of Programming

What? We didn't order any room service.

Mr. Garrison

Oh, well, the woman at the front desk sent it up.

Head of Programming

Carol? [lifts the platter's lid for a brief peek, then lowers it] Well, I'll have to check on this. Excuse me a minute, fellas. [leaves. Mr. Garrison continues inside the office when the coast is clear. He takes the cart to the desk and parks it there. Kyle pops out and rushes to lock the door]

Kyle

Clear!

Mr. Garrison

[whips out his walkie-talkie and speaks into it] Okay, Mr. Slave! [From a nearby building Mr. Slave swings down like Spiderman and crashes through the window, but passes out on impact. His body collapses on the floor]

Mr. Slave

Unh, Jesus [a chunk of window falls onto his ass] Christ.

Mr. Garrison

Well crap, that didn't work.

-----


South Park Mall, day. Stan and his group face off against Craig and his group at the center of the mall.

Stan

You'd better shut up, Craig.

Craig

Everyone knows it's true!

Stan

It is not!

Craig

Is so!

Tom

Craig! Behave yourself!

Randy

Yeah, Stanley. What are you fighting about?

Stan

Dad, Craig is trying to say that his dad can out dress you!

Randy

What? Son, that's a silly thing to fight about.

Tom

Yeah. Everyone already knows I dress better than Randy.

Randy

Oh really?!

Tom

I mean, you do have the fashion sense of a Japanese woman.

Men

Ooooo.

Randy

Please, girlfriend. You look like some kind of Little Orphan Annie nightmare.

Other men

Oh no, errrr!

Sharon

Oh, stop it! Will you all just stop it?! [the men fall silent] Look, you guys are carrying this fad too far! Will you please stop acting this way?!

Tom

You don't... like us being metrosexual?

The women

NO!

Randy

Well, you know what I think? I think you're all metrophobic!

The males

Yeah!!

Linda

What?

Jimbo

We shouldn't be fighting amongst ourselves, we should be uniting against metrophobes like these!

Sharon

This is crazy!

Randy

[steps forward, past the boys] Crazy? Different? Outcasts? Call us what you want. But us metros are real people, just like you!

Tom

[steps forward, past the boys] You can metrobash us all you want, but we're here to stay!

Craig

[steps forward, past his father] Yeah Mom! We're proud of who we are.

Cartman

[steps forward] That's right. Proud. You know what I think, guys? I think we should have a metrosexual pride parade.

Ryan

Great idea, Eric! Raise metrosexual awareness!

Stuart

We can make floats and decorate them with streamers and flowers!

Kenny

(Woohoohoo!)

Randy

Come on, fellas! Out of the malls and into the streets!

The males

Out of the malls and into the streets! Out of the malls and into the streets! Out of the malls and into the streets!

Mrs. Tweek

What the hell did that show do to them?

-----


HBC Television Headquarters, New York. Police have been called in and have apprehended Mr. Garrison, Mr. Slave, and Kyle.

Officer

You sure you don't want to press charges?

Kyan

That's okay, officer. I think they learned murder is wrong.

Carson

Especially in those pants.

Mr. Garrison

[the cops leave] Look, guys, we're sorry we tried to murder you, but... You have to stop what you're doing!

Jai

Are you crazy?! We're the hottest thing on TV!

Mr. Garrison

But don't you see the price? You're selling out your own kind. Look, us gays have created a lifestyle, a, a culture that is uniquely ours. If we keep trying to make straight people into us, well, we're gonna have no identity left.

Kyan

Sorry Charlie, no sale. [he and the others turn and walk away]

Mr. Garrison

Buh... but... this doesn't make sense! [grabs his head] How can gay men do this to their own people?? [the Queer Eye guys reach the exit] Unless... you're not gay at all... [the guys stop, turn around, look at Garrison angrily, then return]

Thom

You just had to push it, didn't you?!

Jai

Just had to keep asking question!

Carson

[locks the exit] Now you know the truth!

Kyle

They aren't gay? Then what are they?

Kyan

For a thousand years our kind have lived beneath the earth's crust! Banished by man in the Kindling Wars.

Mr. Garrison

Oh my God. [Kyan steps forward and begins to crumble. A walking crab pops out]

Leader

We are the Crab People!

Kyle

AAAAAAAAAAAAH!

Mr. Slave

Jesus Christ!

The Queer Eye guys

[they too crumble and advance] Crab People! Crab People! Crab People!

-----


 A subterranean cave. The crab people lead their hostages to their camp.

Crab People

 Crab People! Crab People! Crab People!.

Crab Leader

[entirely red] See now where we have been forced to live for a thousand years! But soon we shall rule the land above, and mankind will be gone!

Mr. Garrison

Gone?? ["Crab People! Crab People!"]

Crab Man 2

Crab people are too small and weak to take over man by force, and so we came up with our perfect plan! [another crab person walks over to a closet full of human shells, all of them replicas of the Queer Eye guys. The crab person climbs in a Carson replica and closes the shell behind him. Carson's replica comes to life]

Carson replica

If you can't beat man, [drops down from his hook] change man!

Mr. Garrison

I knew it! I knew gay people would never do this to their own kind! [some crab people restrain him and Mr. Slave]

Crab Leader

When all the world is metrosexual, the crab people shall finally reign supreme!! [raises his pincers and claps. The other crab people join him and clap]

Crab People

Crab People! Crab People!

Crab Solo

Taste like crab, talk like people.

Crab People

Crab People!

Kyle

You'll never turn ME into a metrosexual! I like being a dirty, filthy little boy!

Crab Man 2

[approaches] Very well. If we can't make you into metrosexuals, then we will make you into crab people! Take them!! [the crab people swarm in and separate the hostages. Some of them take Kyle into Crabwear and select a crab outfit for him to wear. Then they take him to Crab Salon and put antennae on his hat, then they take him to get a facial, then they march him down the underground road]

Singers(Crab People)


All things just keep getting better
You... came into my life
(Crab People)
and my world never looked so bright. Yeah.
(Crab People)
It's true. You bring out the best in me.

South Park, day. A Metrosexual Pride Parade moves down the street in the background, and News 4 is covering it.

Reporter

Tom, I'm standing in South Park, Colorado, where the first Metrosexual Pride Parade is underway! [in a rainbow peacock float Randy, Jimbo, Skeeter and Stuart ride and cheer. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny ride in a banana float which features an ocean wave and a palm tree. On the tree waves a rainbow flag that says "Here to Stay"

The boys


We're here! [clap clap]
We're not queer! [clap clap]
But we're close! [clap clap]
Get used to it!
We're here! [clap clap]
We're not queer! [clap clap]
But we're close! [clap clap]
Get used to it!



Sharon

[as the boys' voices fade away] That does it! I can't take it anymore!

The boys


We're here! [clap clap]
We're not queer! [clap clap]
But we're close! [clap clap]
Get used to it!



Linda

I should have never wished for a cleaner, neater husband.

Sharon

Ladies, get your things! I know what we have to do! [leads the ladies away. Randy's float hits a pothole and veers to the right. It hits the sushi restaurant as the spectators back away quickly]

Jimbo

Whoa, look out! [the float hits the building and breaks a window. A small fire is heard]

Randy

Oh my God, it's on fire! [the men jump out of the float and run to the other side of the street]

Skeeter

Put it out! Put it out!

Randy

I can't do anything! These are brand-new pants!

Skeeter

The heat could really damage our hair. We'd better let the police handle this!

Officer Barbrady

[seated on his patrol car, buffing his nails] Are you crazy? I just had my uniform pressed!

Jimbo

[the float and building are now fully engulfed in flames] Oh Jesus, it's burning! Oh my God!

Skeeter

Eeeek!

Randy

Put it out! Put it out! Fire!

HBC Headquarters, New York. The Queer Eye guys work on President Bush on their show.

Carson

Mr. President, it is such an honor to make you over!

Kyan

Now, we've got to do something with your hair.

Thom

And your nails are filthy. Let's get those clean.

Head of Programming

This is gay gold! [Mr. Garrison, Mr. Slave, and Kyle look down from the sound booth]

Mr. Garrison

Stop them! They're crab people!

Crab Man 3

They cannot see or hear us, foolish man. Now stand by and watch as your pitiful race becomes helpless!!

Carson

That is very good, Mr. President. Now, put on this silk jacket. [Kyan, Jai, and Thom remove the President's coat and Carson hands him the jacket]

Kyle

No Mr. President!! Don't do it! [the crab man holding him quickly covers his mouth] Help!

Mr. Garrison

You bastards!

Kyan

That looks great! Now, how about some moisturizer. [Bush and the guys smile. The studio door bursts open and the women flood into the studio wielding bats]

Sharon

There they are! Get 'em!

Kyan

What? [their smiles vanish]

Linda

You turned our husbands into whiny little wusses!!

Sarah

It's payback time! [the women rush in and start beating up the Queer Eye guys]

Head of Programming

Oh my God, what are they doing?!

Crab Man 3

Oh noooo!! [Mr. Garrison and Mr. Slave react and crack the crab people in two in the booth as the women finish Queer Eye guys off below]

Head of Programming

[kneeling at the corpses of Carson and Kyan] Wha? What have you done?

Sharon

We're sorry, but we didn't have a choice. You see, at first we liked having our men be clean and neat. We thought that having them use product in their hair and wanting facials would make them sexier. But it doesn't.

Linda

That's right. Event though my Steven sickens me out sometimes, it's his rugged manly grossness that I'm attracted to.

Sarah

We're sorry, but we knew that the only answer was tuh kill the Queer Eye guys.

Head of Programming

Well you're going to jail for thi-! [Kyan's body begins to move, and the HoP looks down] Wait a minute. [a crab man crawls out] What is that?

Crab Leader

No! Our evil plans! Noooo... [dies]

Head of Programming

Oh my God. They were crab people.

Mr. Garrison

[enters the studio with Slave and Kyle in tow] Yes! They were trying to systematically make men into wusses so they could take over the world!

Kyle

Mom!

Sheila

Kyle!

Head of Programming

I should have known they were crab people. They tried this before with The Jeffersons.

Mr. Garrison

So now, can you please change your network's programming?

Head of Programming

Yes. Yes, I think this gay fad is over. Gentlemen, back to Studio 12! We're gonna bring back the Latin fad.

South Park. The sign has been redrawn with a barrio graffiti font.

The McCormick house, day. Randy, Jimbo, Skeeter, and Stuart are now dressed as cholos on the porch. Two six-packs of Coronas are on the ground. Some of the bottles are already empty.

Randy

Hey eses.

Stuart

Hey hefe. You want some cerveza? [hands Randy a beer.]

South Park Elementary, day. Kyle walks into view in the school hall.

Stan

Kyle. Hey, ese. You wanna come play catch with us?

Kyle

What? Y-you want me to hang out with you?

Stan

Yeah. It's cool, holmes.

Kyle

No, dude, it really isn't cool. You all turned your backs on me. You're supposed to be my best friends and you just... treated me like nothing! And now you all expect me to just forget it all and, and hang out with you again like nothing happened?

Stan

Aw Jesus, Kyle, don't be such a whiny little gaywad! Come play catch with us. [turns and walks away]

Cartman

Yeah, don't be such a fag, dude! [turns and walks away. Kenny just looks at him and walks off. Kyle looks away, then back at the boys, then walks away in the opposite direction. He stops, thinks for a while, then turns around and hurries to them]

Kyle

God-damnit!
