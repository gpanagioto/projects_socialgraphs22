<i>[steps forward]</i> That's right. And over 30% of the world's oxygen <i>[Kenny sees her and begins to swoon]</i> is made in the rainforest. <i>[smiles back at him. Kenny's in love - ahem, distracted. The camera stays on him]</i> Lenny? Johnny? Oh. <i>[looks away and picks her nose.]</i> <i>[picks her nose]</i> Your family isn't poor? <i>[picks her nose]</i> Wow, seeing a place like this really makes you appreciate living in America, huh? <i>[walks over to Kenny, her partner]</i> Did you remember all the choreography, Lenny? Wow! Isn't he neat, Lenny? <i>[takes a picture]</i> <i>[walking behind Kenny]</i> Benny? Do you think we're gonna be okay? That's good. Can I tell you something? I think I like you. <i>[holds his shoulder]</i>  Yeah. I mean, I think we communicate really well. <i>[looks away]</i> No, that's not good. No. See, if I start to like you too much, <i>[looks away]</i> I'm only going to get my heart broken. 'Cause we live on opposite ends of the country. <i>[looks at him again]</i> Once this choir tour is over, we'll never see each other again. <i>[grabs him and gets emotional]</i> And that would devastate me. <i>[lets go]</i> So I can't have any feelings for you, I just can't, Lenny! <i>[walks away]</i> Benny, will you hold my hand? <i>[picks her nose. When she lowers her hand, Kenny grabs it, but she looks away]</i> I don't want to get emotionally attached, though. We are? Me, too! <i>[the rest start to groan]</i>  I hate the rainforest!   Oh, but I do like you.  Oh, but you're only going to leave me.  Larry, if we make it out of this, I want to be your girlfriend. Even if we do live in different places, I don't care!  Oh no, that big thing is going to make love to Miss Stevens! Okay, Benny. So in order for our long-distance relationship to work, we'll have to call each other every other day. Aaaah! Lenny! No!   Whah?? Who?! Who killed him?! Who's "they"?! Well don't just stand there, help him!! Aaagh!
