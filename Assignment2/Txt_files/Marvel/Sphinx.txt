'''Anath-Na Mut''' is a chief [[magician (fantasy)|wizard]] in the court of [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] [[pharaoh]] [[Ramesses II]]. Defeated in a [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] duel by the prophet [[Moses]], the magician got exiled into the desert for his failure.<ref>Seen in flashback in ''Fantastic Four'' Annual #12 (1977)</ref> The title ''[[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]]'' recounts in a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] of how Anath-Na discovers the mystic '''Ka Stone''', which grants him [[immortality]] and superhuman powers. Using an alias of the Sphinx, Anath-Na wanders around the Earth for a thousand years and then, eventually became bored with it.<ref>''Nova'' #6-7 (Feb.-Mar. 1977)</ref> After learning about the origins of Richard Rider, [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]] from planet [[Xandar]], and their sentient machine, the Sphinx theorized that Xandar's Living Computer just might be a way to end his [[Life extension|eternal life]].<ref>''Nova'' #11 (Jul. 1977)</ref>

In a ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]'' annual, the Sphinx empowered a pawn known as Thraxon to help subdue the [[Inhumans]]. He utilizes ruler [[Black Bolt]]'s electron energy to amplify a scanning device and read all the minds in everyone for knowledge of how the Sphinx could finally die. Superhero team the [[Fantastic Four]] defeated Thraxon and in a final confrontation, Black Bolt blasts him into deep space.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' Annual #12 (1977)</ref> The Sphinx reappears in the ''Nova'' series, taking mental control of Nova, along with his temporary allies ([[Comet (Marvel Comics)|Comet]], [[Crimebuster (Marvel Comics)#Frank Moore|Crimebuster]], [[Diamondhead (comics)|Diamondhead]], [[Powerhouse (comics)#Powerhouse (Rieg Davan)|Powerhouse]], and [[Doctor Sun]]), they travel back to Xandar and join a war against the invading [[Skrull]]s.<ref>''Nova'' #23-25 (Jan.-May (bi-monthly) 1978)</ref>

The story continues in the ''Fantastic Four'' series, where this proves to be a ruse as, once on Xandar, the Sphinx took advantage of that war so he can find and absorb more knowledge from its planet-size computer. Evolving into a [[god]], the Sphinx decided to destroy the Earth. The Fantastic Four witness this and, knowing that they are outmatched, [[Mister Fantastic]] contacts the cosmic entity [[Galactus]] and presents a proposal â€” if he stops the Sphinx, then Mister Fantastic will release him from his vow to never threaten Earth again. He accepts and when the group found Galactus a new herald ([[Terrax]]), they traveled to Earth again. After Galactus defeated the Sphinx, he crushed the Ka Stone and send him back in human form to ancient Egypt, where Anath-Na belongs. As Anath-Na, he is trapped in a [[time loop]], forcing him to constantly relive his life to this point.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #206-213 (May-Dec. 1979)</ref>

An issue of the title ''[[Marvel Two-In-One]]'' continues the story, as Anath-Na relives his life several times due to a chronal flaw, until he meets himself, the younger Anath-Na. He warns himself about his fate in the future. Then, the two build a machine to reconstruct the Ka Stone and after hypnotizing the past version of Anath-Na so that he would not remember, the future version enters [[suspended animation]]. The future Sphinx awakens after Galactus departs and begins to rebuild the Ka Stone.<ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |pages=323-324}}</ref> The heroic [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], however, battles him into a standstill, destroys his machine, and leaving the Sphinx with an incomplete Ka Stone.<ref>''Marvel Two-In-One'' #91 (Sep. 1982)</ref> But, the Sphinx learns that the unfinished stone is losing all of its energies and seeks revenge on the Thing. The villainous [[Puppet Master (Marvel Comics)|Puppet Master]] assists him by forcing the Sphinx to crush his own Ka Stone; as a result Anath-Na immediately ages five thousand years before turning into dust.<ref>''The Thing'' #34 (Apr. 1986)</ref>

As part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' event, the Sphinx obtained Nadeen Hassan's brother Navid as an apprentice where he helped him retrieve numerous Egyptian artifacts from the San Francisco Museum of Egyptian Culture.<ref>''[[Howling Commandos of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' #3</ref>

===Meryet Karim===
'''Meryet Karim''' is a desert nomad who finds an unconscious Anath-Na Mut soon after he found the Ka Stone. While nursing him back to health, Karim absorbed residual energies from the Ka Stone, which granted her a fraction of its powers. Karim discovers that every time she was being perpetually reincarnated into new bodies and retains the knowledge of her previous life with each death. In the modern era, she finds the Ka Scepter's remnants and reconstructs it to become the new Sphinx. Then, Karim alters history so Anath-Na will kill Moses that leads to Egypt, eventually conquering the world during the ''Forever Yesterday'' storyline. She got thwarted by the superhero team the [[New Warriors]] and resurrected Anath-Na in a bid to reclaim his love. The empowered Sphinx battles the New Warriors, but when facing his feelings for Karim, he merges with her into one composite entity who goes back in time to live a normal life.<ref>''The New Warriors'' #47-50 (May.-Jul. 1994); ''Nova'' #6-7 (Jun.-Jul 1994);'' Night Thrasher'' vol. 2 #11-12 (Jun.-Jul. 1994)</ref>

The character discovers that Galactus' curse is still in effect and battles Nova once again, intent on having access to Xandarian knowledge.<ref>''Nova'' vol. 3 #1 (May 1999); #3-6 (July-Oct. 1999)</ref> The Sphinx appears in an issue of the fourth volume of the title ''Nova''.<ref>''Nova'' vol. 4, #20 (Feb. 2009)</ref>
