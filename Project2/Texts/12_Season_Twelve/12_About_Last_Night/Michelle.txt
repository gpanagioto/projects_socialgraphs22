 Barack, everyone's been looking for you. What on earth are you doing? Okay Barack, tell me what's going on? What is it?  Barack, what is it?! You gotta be kiddin' me. So the entire diamond vault is inaccessible?! Is McCain online?  You guys weren't runnin' update checks on the security logs?! On a new system, in an hour?! Are you nuts? My job was to pretend to be married to this bozo and get you three scan hacks into a laser system! Egh. Tell Davis to get me a fortrans emitter and enough pulse drives to light a spark. I've almost got it. You're only going to have five minutes. Do you understand? Oh Jesus, now is not the time, B. My girls need somebody better than a world-class diamond thief. Woowait, there! I got it. Go!  You're serious. Aww, what the fuck.
