Oh yeah! I saw it on the news, Kyle! The school is gonna make us all get shots again!  But this time it's so that we don't get warts in our vaginas! Yep! Then why are they sayin' that gettin' vaccinated at school is gonna make us all retarded? Wait what? Wait, there's a disease called Assburgers? You are so lying! There's no disease called fuckin' Assburgers! Okay, you're on, Jew!  Did you guys know there's actually a disease called Assburgers?  That's right, it's a butt fungus. ''Turn on your heart light. Let it shine wherever you go. Let it make a happy glow-''  Fever... Light... lightheadedness... I don't know what's wrong with me. Oh, that's a relief. I thought maybe I had a fever but I- oh OH. Oh my buns! There's a sharp pain in my buns! I-I'll try. I'll try.  A what?? Are you serious? How can there be-  Oh my God! You're saying I have assburgers?? What are you talking about?? I got vaccinated from the school, and now clearly I have Assburgers! Well I'm glad ''you'' think Assburgers is funny! Just note my condition on your records there!  Godamned stupid school nurse! Heartless bitch!  I spent all morning making hamburgers for nothing! That's what's the matter! Really? Gee, thanks Kyle! Next order, please! Get your Cartman Burgers here, fresh and flavorful. There you go, Molly, and a bag of chips. How are we doing on those patties, Jew? Nice! It's alright. I think another batch is just finishing off in our top-secret flavor enhancer. I'm sorry Kyle, but if we compromise our final cooking process, then our patented flavor will be everywhere, and we'll have to go back to school. Now, let me get those hamburgers.  Everything alright here, Kyle? We're uh gonna need some more patties pretty soon. Alright, I'll take these to the flavor enhancer. The Zookeeper 2: Zookeepier!
