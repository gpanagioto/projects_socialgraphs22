So what does does this job pay? Uh, I'm afraid I don't really like rides. I'm not interested. If you need security, I need a cash salary. Well, look: Why don't you just let a couple of people in each day? Every day you can just let two people in, charge $29.95 per ticket, and then you can use ''that'' to pay my daily salary. This place is huge. You'll never notice two people. And then you'll have security for your park. I will shoot on sight.  What? Uh, I'm security, not maintenance.  Well your rides are gonna break down every now and then. You need to hire a maintenance person. Move along, sir.  Move along, sir! You are vandalizing private property!
