I just-- have a boyfriend who really supports me. There's a bomb threat? Babe, is everything okay? You seem...distantly lately. Did I do something wrong? You don't really talk to me the same way you used to. Oh, God, I'm sounding needy, huh? Eric, I just--I hope that you're always honest with me, even if you think it might hurt my feelings. Wow, babe. Looks like all our dreams are kind of on hold for a while, huh? Well, what do you mean?
