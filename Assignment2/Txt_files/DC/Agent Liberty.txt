==Fictional character biography==
Benjamin Lockwood once worked for the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] but ultimately left in disgust at their methods and the types of missions he was being asked to undertake. He became so disenchanted with the Federal Government as a whole that he joined the paramilitary group called the '''Sons of Liberty''', who gave him the  equipment to become Agent Liberty.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |last2=Pasko |first2=Martin |title=The Essential Superman Encyclopedia |date=2010 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=978-0-345-50108-0 |page=5}}</ref> As Agent Liberty, Lockwood helped to forward the Sons' cause of overturning the governmental regime which brought him into conflict with [[Superman]], though he later briefly assisted the Justice League in battling [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]] in the crossover ''[[Panic in the Sky (comics)|Panic in the Sky]]''. However, when the Sons asked him to assassinate politician [[Pete Ross]], Lockwood refused and helped to bring down the group by sending vital information to reporter Clark Kent (Superman's secret civilian identity).

Lockwood later learns that one of the founders of the Sons of Liberty was his former CIA mentor, and he became so disgusted with this revelation that he burned his Agent Liberty costume, vowing to never adopt the persona again. However, Lockwood subsequently becomes one of the many unwillingly brainwashed victims of a cult started by Brainiac and takes up the Agent Liberty identity once more.<ref>''Birds of Prey'' #72 (Oct. 2004).

Later, during the Earth-shaking crisis of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Agent Liberty is seen at a mass for fallen and missing superheroes.

==Powers and abilities==
Agent Liberty is highly skilled in military tactics, hand-to-hand combat and marksmanship. His high-tech battle suit can generate a force-field of energy capable of deflecting bullets and houses weapons such as retractable gauntlet blades. He wears a jetpack that allows flight and was able to summon attack helicopters and other assistance from the Sons of Liberty. 

==Other characters named Agent Liberty==
During the Codename: Patriot arc, a new female Agent Liberty has been seen as part of President Martin Suarez' security team.<ref>''World of New Krypton'' #6. DC Comics.</ref> It is unknown at this time if she is connected to the Sons of Liberty, or even her predecessor Benjamin Lockwood, or if she is in fact yet another agent in General Lane's considerable list of operatives. The new Agent Liberty is apparently killed by [[Ursa (comics)|Ursa]] when she attacks the White House during the ''[[War of the Supermen]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|title=war+of+sup+3-08 (JPEG file)|url=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_pScx8BN4h3s/S_UTvmkPUTI/AAAAAAAAIZQ/Qt2BNcEq3Xk/s1600/war+of+sup+3-08.jpg|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303181004/http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_pScx8BN4h3s/S_UTvmkPUTI/AAAAAAAAIZQ/Qt2BNcEq3Xk/s1600/war+of+sup+3-08.jpg|archive-date=2016-03-03}}</ref>

[[Sam Witwer]] portrays a heavily adapted version of Agent Liberty on ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'', set within [[The CW]]'s [[live-action]] [[Arrowverse]]. Introduced as the "ruthless and terrifying" villain of the [[Supergirl (season 4)|fourth season]], this version of the character is depicted as "a brilliant orator in the guise of a family man" who has "eerie abilities of persuasion and manipulation".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://ew.com/tv/2018/07/17/smallville-sam-witwer-supergirl-season-4-agent-liberty/|title=Smallville alum Sam Witwer joins Supergirl season 4 as Agent Liberty|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|last=Agard|first=Chancellor|date=July 17, 2018|access-date=July 17, 2018}}</ref> Benjamin "Ben" Lockwood was once a mild-mannered college history professor who lost his home and father Peter (portrayed by [[Xander Berkeley]]) during the [[Daxamite]] [[Supergirl (season 2)|invasion]] and [[List of Supergirl characters#Samantha Arias / Reign|Reign]]'s [[Supergirl (season 3)|terraforming]] of Earth, respectively. Upon being fired by the university for his [[Speciesism|anti-alien]] opinions, Ben was approached by [[Lex Luthor]]'s subordinates, [[Mercy Graves|Mercy]] and [[Otis Graves]], who gave him the gear to become a self-proclaimed "'''Agent of Liberty'''". Ben founds the '''Children of Liberty''' to create a [[Anthropocentrism|human-first]] world order and rid [[National City (DC Comics)|National City]] of alien life whilst keeping these activities a secret from his wife Lydia (portrayed by [[Sarah Smyth]]) and son George (portrayed by [[Graham Verchere]]). He later wins a national television alien debate against reporter [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Kara Danvers]], Supergirl's secret civilian identity, prompting the network to offer Ben his very own weekly show named "The Lockdown". He is arrested after Supergirl learns of his identity, and a large crowd of human rights activists led by Lydia protest his imprisonment. Ben is given a full pardon by [[President of the United States|President]] Phil Baker on the technicality that all of his victims were aliens rather than humans. He is promoted as the Director of Alien Affairs for the US government and repeals the Alien Amnesty Act. After [[Superman: Red Son#Television|Red Daughter]] poses as Supergirl and attacks the [[White House]], Baker deputises Ben's Children of Liberty and gives them access to [[Department of Extranormal Operations|DEO]] weapons to begin rounding up aliens. Ben later injects himself with [[Lena Luthor]]'s "[[Black Kryptonite|Harun-El]]" serum and gains superhuman abilities to avenge Lydia's death at the hands of one such alien. Upon learning that Lex was the one who orchestrated his rise within the government, Ben kills Otis and attacks Luthor's base of operations on Shelley Island with his Children of Liberty only to encounter Supergirl's team instead. In the ensuing battle, Ben is cured of the Harun-El by [[Jimmy Olsen|James Olsen]], thus stripping him of his powers before he and his men are arrested. Ben is enraged to see George blaming him for Lydia's murder and denouncing his anti-alien campaign on television. In the [[Supergirl (season 5)|fifth season]] episode "[[It's a Super Life]]", [[Mister Mxyzptlk|Mxyzptlk]] creates an alternate reality in which Ben's family died jumping off a building thinking that Supergirl would save them. This in turn leads to Agent Liberty abducting Lena to blackmail Supergirl into revealing her identity before the Children of Liberty kill Kara's loved ones.
