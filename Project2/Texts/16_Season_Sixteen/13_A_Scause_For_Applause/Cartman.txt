 I can't believe we all got duped. I've been wearin' this stupid things for months! I feel like such a tool. All right, let's do this! Make me believe in something that's bullshit, will you?!  Yep, it's done. You know I spent five bucks on that stupid thing?! Oh don't even start, Kenny! Just because you guys didn't buy into the bracelets doesn't mean you're smarter than me, okay?!  What's wrong with him? Uh huh. So weak dude. Dark times, brah, dark times.  Dude, what the hell? You're wearing a "What Would Jesus Do" bracelet! The big whoop isn't that you have one, the big whoop is that you're still wearing it! Well don't you care?! Jesus Asterisk Christ, Stan! People are feeling really cheated by all this! Craig?! You asshole!  Dude, what's this about orange bracelets? Where do you get them? Dude, I don't give a crap about using recycled plastic! ...Oh, I guess I do care about that. Huh.  Okay, I need a violet one for domestic violence, a lime one for herpes, and a jade green one for how much I hate Kyle. ...Fuck! Dude, weak.
