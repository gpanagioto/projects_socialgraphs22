==Publication history==
Wonder Man debuted in the [[superhero]]-team title ''[[The Avengers (comic)|The Avengers]]'' #9 ([[cover-date]]d October 1964), and appeared to die in that issue.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=102}}</ref> Four years later, ''The Avengers'' #58 (November 1968) revisited the events of #9, explaining that the Avengers had electronically saved Wonder Man's mind in a computer. Wonder Man was not seen again until ''The Avengers'' #102 (August 1972), where he made a cameo appearance in a comatose state. Wonder Man's body is revived by the villain [[Kang the Conqueror|Kang]] in ''The Avengers'' #131-132 (January – February 1975), and then again by the [[Black Talon (comics)|Black Talon]] in ''The Avengers'' #152 (October 1976), and finally by the [[Living Laser]] in ''The Avengers'' Annual #6 (1976). After this last encounter, Wonder Man finally recovers his faculties and joins the Avengers in a full-time capacity in ''The Avengers'' #160 (June 1977). Wonder Man and his fellow Avenger [[Beast (comics)|the Beast]] were cast as buddies and lovers of nightlife, which would become a fan-favorite dynamic of ''The Avengers'' and continue to be used after the two characters left the series.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Boney|first=Alex |title=The Beauty of the Beast: Marvel's First Break-Out Mutant|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=#29 |pages=21–22|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=August 2008|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref>

[[Marvel Comics]]' then-publisher [[Stan Lee]] said in 1978, "You know, years ago we brought out Wonder Man, and <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[DC Comics]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> sued us because they had [[Wonder Woman]], and... I said okay, I'll discontinue Wonder Man. And all of a sudden they've got [[Power Girl]] [after Marvel had introduced [[Luke Cage|Power Man]]<nowiki>]</nowiki>. Oh, boy. How unfair."<ref>{{Cite journal | title=Hello, Culture Lovers: Stan the Man Raps with Marvel Maniacs at [[James Madison University]] | journal=[[The Comics Journal]] | issue=#42 | date=October 1978 | page=55}}</ref>

Wonder Man later appeared as a founding member of the spin-off ''[[West Coast Avengers]]'' first in a four-issue [[miniseries]] (September – December 1984), and continuing as one of the primary characters in the series' 102-issue run. After that team disbanded, he joined the team [[Force Works]] in a series that debuted with a July 1994 cover-date. After that team splintered, Wonder Man rejoined the Avengers in ''The Avengers'' vol. 3 #4 (May 1998). After the collapse of the team in ''The Avengers'' #503 (December 2004), Wonder Man joined a new splinter group called the [[The Mighty Avengers|Mighty Avengers]], co-starred in that team's series, which premiered with March 2007 cover-date.

Wonder Man starred in a self-titled [[graphic novel]] in 1986. He then starred in a 29-issue series, ''Wonder Man'' (September 1991 – February 1994), which was followed in by the three-issue miniseries ''Avengers Two: Wonder Man and the Beast'' (2000). In 2007, he starred in the five-issue miniseries ''Wonder Man: My Fair Super Hero''.

Wonder Man appeared sporadically throughout the 2010-2013 ''Avengers'' series, but played an important role in the "End Times" storyline in issue #31 (December 2012) through its final issue #34 (January 2013).

Comic book writer Rick Remender revealed in an interview that Wonder Man would be a member of the [[Uncanny Avengers]], starting with issue #5.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=42200|title=Remender Expands The Cast Of "Uncanny Avengers"|date=14 November 2012}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
'''Simon Williams''' is the son of rich industrialist Sanford Williams, owner of Williams Innovations. Simon inherits the munitions factory after his father's death, but the company's profits fall due to its biggest competitor [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] and his company [[Stark Industries]]. On the advice of his brother [[Grim Reaper (Marvel Comics)|Eric]], Simon tries to embezzle funds from his company but is caught and incarcerated. Simon blames Stark for this and accepts the proposition of master villain [[Heinrich Zemo|Baron Heinrich Zemo]] after the [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]] pays his bail, as a pawn is required to infiltrate the Avengers. The desperate Simon Williams agrees and is transformed into an [[ion]]-powered being with superhuman powers. His powers are tested, and he is shown to have great superhuman strength and durability, even defeating the Executioner. Called Wonder Man by Zemo, he is then sent to meet and join the Avengers, with instructions to betray them at a critical moment so that Zemo's [[Masters of Evil]] can destroy the Avengers. Zemo ensures Wonder Man's loyalty by advising him that as a result of the treatment his body now requires periodic doses of a serum to survive—a serum that only Zemo can provide. The Avengers are lured into a trap and captured. The plan fails when Wonder Man decides to save the Avengers and aid them against Zemo, apparently at the cost of his own life. Hank Pym records Wonder Man's brain patterns in the hope that one day he can be revived.<ref>''The Avengers'' #9 (October 1964) and #58 (November 1968). Marvel Comics.</ref> Unbeknownst to the Avengers, Wonder Man's body has simply entered a catatonic state as it adjusts to the effects of the treatment.{{Issue|date=July 2009}} Eric Williams becomes distraught over the apparent death of his sibling and, blaming the Avengers, assumes the identity of the [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]] in an effort to destroy them. The Grim Reaper steals Simon's body at one point,<ref>''The Avengers'' #102 (August 1972). Marvel Comics.</ref> and attacks the Avengers three times before Wonder Man finally returns.<ref>''The Avengers'' #52 (May 1968); #79 (August 1970); #102 (August 1972); #107-108 (January – February 1973). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Wonder Man remains in suspended animation for years, and it is during this period that [[Ultron]], the evil robot creation of [[Hank Pym]], steals the brain patterns recorded by the Avengers for use as a template for the synthezoid [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]].<ref>''The Avengers'' #57-58 (October – November 1968). Marvel Comics.</ref> It is later revealed that Vision is built from the [[Human Torch (android)|original Human Torch]], an android created by Professor [[Phineas Horton]].<ref>''The Avengers'' #134-135 (April – May 1975). Marvel Comics.</ref> This only happened in mainstream continuity and other origins were possible courtesy of the [[Forever Crystal]] of [[Immortus]].<ref>''[[Avengers Forever]]'' #1-12 (December 1998 – February 2000). Marvel Comics.</ref>

During this vulnerable time, Wonder Man is used as a pawn on three occasions. Wonder Man is briefly revived by [[Kang the Conqueror]] to battle the Avengers as part of his [[Legion of the Unliving]],<ref>''The Avengers'' #131-132 (January – February 1975); ''Giant-Size Avengers'' #3 (February 1975). Marvel Comics.</ref> and later "resurrected" as a [[zombie]] by [[Black Talon (comics)|Black Talon]] and the Grim Reaper to attack the Avengers once more.<ref>''The Avengers'' #151-153 (September – November 1976). Marvel Comics.</ref> On the final occasion, the Living Laser hypnotizes a now-awake but still very weak Wonder Man, in an unsuccessful attack on the Avengers.<ref>''The Avengers'' Annual #6 (1976). Marvel Comics.</ref> After this encounter, Wonder Man was restored to true life and chooses to remain with the Avengers, aiding them against [[Attuma]] and [[Doctor Doom]].<ref>''The Avengers'' #154-156 (December 1976 – January 1977). Marvel Comics.</ref> He also fought the Vision, and helped the Avengers battle [[Graviton (comics)|Graviton]].<ref>''The Avengers'' #158-159 (April – May 1977). Marvel Comics.</ref> He soon after defeats the Grim Reaper, who was intent on destroying the Vision as he was "artificial" and a "mockery" of his brother; Wonder Man at this point is revealed to have become a being of ionic energy.<ref>''The Avengers'' #160 (June 1977). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Wonder Man eventually joins the Avengers in a full-time capacity and becomes close friends with his teammate, the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]]. For several months after his resurrection, Wonder Man suffers from slight claustrophobia and a fear of dying in battle, as he did once before. Wonder Man finally overcomes his fear of death during the final battle with [[Korvac]].<ref>''The Avengers'' #177 (November 1978). Marvel Comics.</ref> Wonder Man invaded his former plant which had been taken over by the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]], and fought [[Madame Masque]] and the [[Dreadnought (comics)|Dreadnought]].<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #55 (August 1980). Marvel Comics.</ref> Developing an interest in acting, Wonder Man stars in minor roles before moving to Hollywood, where fellow Avenger [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] uses his contacts to establish Wonder Man's career.<ref>The beginning of this relationship is seen in ''The Avengers'' #211 (September 1981).</ref> Wonder Man also works for a time as a stuntman, an ideal vocation since he is invulnerable to virtually all conventional weapons.<ref>Mentioned by the Vision at the conclusion of ''The Avengers'' #250 (December 1984).</ref>

Wonder Man helps form the [[West Coast Avengers]],<ref>''The West Coast Avengers'' #1 (September 1984). Marvel Comics.</ref> and his new-found confidence begins to become arrogance. He develops a serious rivalry with Iron Man, but sees the error of his ways after a brutal battle with the [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]].<ref>''The West Coast Avengers'' vol. 2 #25 (October 1987). Marvel Comics.</ref> He also foils Doctor Doom's plot to control the world.<ref>''Marvel Graphic Novel'' #27 ("Emperor Doom - Starring the Mighty Avengers", 1987). Marvel Comics.</ref> His acting career rises, and he is cast as the villain in the fourth film in the successful [[Arkon]] franchise.<ref>''The West Coast Avengers'' vol. 2 #31 (April 1988).</ref> Wonder Man eventually accepts the Vision as his "brother", but there is a setback when the Vision is dismantled and rebuilt as an emotionless machine by a global conglomerate. The [[Scarlet Witch]]—the Vision's wife—asks Wonder Man to provide his brainwaves once again in order to rebuild the foundational personality matrix of the original Vision, but Wonder Man refuses, having feelings for her himself. The [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] further deduces that the Vision's original relationship to the Scarlet Witch may even have been predicated by Wonder Man's initial donation for the original personality matrix; at this, Wonder Man confirms that several of his hesitations about making the attempt arise from these doubts and the subconscious desire he's felt toward the Scarlet Witch since her separation from her husband.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #42-45 (March – June 1989). Marvel Comics.</ref> He is then ensorcelled by the [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]], and battles the Avengers.<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #38-45 (December 1989 – March 1990). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Wonder Man battles old foes [[Erik Josten|Goliath]]<ref>''Wonder Man'' #1 (September 1991)</ref> and the Enchantress,<ref>''Wonder Man'' #2 (October 1991). Marvel Comics.</ref> before meeting his would-be sidekick "Spider" and battling Gamma-Burn, resulting in wrecking his jet-pack.<ref>''Wonder Man'' #3 (November 1991). Marvel Comics.</ref> Wonder Man then battles the assassin Splice for the first time.<ref>''Wonder Man'' #4 (December 1991). Marvel Comics.</ref> Wonder Man takes part in the Kree/Shi'ar War, and had his powers altered when he and the Vision failed to prevent the Shi'ar Nega-Bomb from detonating.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #80-82 (March – May 1992); ''Quasar'' #32-33 (March – April 1992); ''Wonder Man'' #7-9 (March – May 1992). Marvel Comics.</ref> He battled Angkor,<ref>''Wonder Man'' #11-12 (July – August 1992)</ref> and then journeyed to Hades where he battled [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], [[Blackheart]], the Enchantress, and the Grim Reaper; he then learned that he was immortal.<ref>''Wonder Man'' #22-25 (June – September 1993). Marvel Comics.</ref> When Avengers West Coast (renamed) disbands after a dispute, Wonder Man becomes a founding member of its successor group [[Force Works]], but is disintegrated in an explosion during their first mission against the alien [[Kree]].<ref name="Force Works' 1994">''Force Works'' #1 (July 1994).

Marvel Comics.</ref> Several months later, the Scarlet Witch is able to fully revive Wonder Man and he now exists in an independent, more human form. It is also discovered later that the Grim Reaper - dead at the time - is also revived.<ref>''The Avengers'' vol. 3 #10-11 (November – December 1998).

Wonder Man is blackmailed into working for [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] during the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' storyline. Due to charges of misappropriation of funds in his non-profit organization, Wonder Man is pressured to work for the pro-registration side in the ensuing [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] drama. In addition to capturing renegade vigilantes and criminals, Wonder Man is instrumental in creating televised messages to educate the public and yet-unregistered superhumans about the specifics of the Registration Act.<ref>''Civil War'' #1-7 (May 2006 – January 2007). Marvel Comics.</ref> Wonder Man became a member of the [[The Mighty Avengers|Mighty Avengers]].<ref>''The Mighty Avengers'' #1 (May 2007). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Wonder Man began a romantic relationship with fellow Mighty Avenger [[Carol Danvers|Ms. Marvel]] warning her not to use her position as leader of the Avengers to keep him out of potentially dangerous situations just because of their relationship.<ref>''The Mighty Avengers'' #6 (October 2007). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Following the events of the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'', [[Norman Osborn]] created a [[Dark Avengers|new team of Avengers]], effectively retiring Wonder Man during the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'' storyline. Wonder Man later appears on television, lamenting his tenure as an Avenger, claiming it was all a waste of time, and that using violence to uphold justice has caused nothing but heartache and death. He ends his speech by sadly admitting that having Osborn in charge is exactly what the country deserves.<ref>''The New Avengers'' #51 (May 2009). Marvel Comics.</ref> After this, Wonder Man is imprisoned as a member of the new [[Lethal Legion]]. This group opposes the tyrannical efforts of Osborn; Wonder Man joins to try to keep them from hurting innocents.<ref>''Dark Reign: Lethal Legion'' #1 (August 2009). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Wonder Man has been seen alongside his old [[West Coast Avengers]] teammates, [[Ronin (Marvel Comics)|Ronin]], [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]], [[Tigra]] and [[War Machine]] in battle with a new version of [[Ultimo (Marvel Comics)|Ultimo]].<ref>''War Machine'' #8 (September 2009). Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the ''[[Heroic Age (comics)|Heroic Age]]'' storyline, Simon is approached by Steve Rogers to join the new team of Avengers. Simon refuses stating that the Avengers have caused more problems than they have solved and implies as Rogers leaves that he will make sure his old allies realize the mistake they are making. Simon also mentioned as having been in jail until Steve bailed him out.<ref>''The Avengers'' vol. 4 #1 (July 2010). Marvel Comics.</ref> After learning that Rogers had disregarded his advice, Wonder Man attacks the new team causing some damage to their base before inexplicably disappearing.<ref>''The Avengers'' vol. 4 #2 (August 2010). Marvel Comics.</ref> Thor and Iron Man later contact him to try and reason with him, but Simon refuses to listen to their arguments, stating that the dead heroes that have resulted from the Avengers working together should be a clear sign that the concept is doomed, departing as Thor and Iron Man try to argue that all heroes are aware of the risks when they begin. Significantly, Iron Man notes that Simon is 'leaking' ionic energy, suggesting that his current mental condition may relate to his powers rather than being simply a matter of choice.<ref name="Avengers' 2011">''The Avengers'' vol. 4 #7 (January 2011). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Wonder Man put together the [[Revengers]], a team of super-powered people to stop the Avengers because he believes they do more harm than good, blaming the Avengers for Ultron's existence, the damage caused by the Scarlet Witch and the Hulk, the Civil War, and Osborn's Dark Avengers. His team subsequently defeats the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] in a quick attack on the mansion before he moves on to attack [[Avengers Tower]],<ref>''The New Avengers'' Annual vol. 2 #1 (September 2011). Marvel Comics.</ref> stating that he will destroy the tower unless the Avengers immediately disband. Although Iron Man manages to trap him in a prison specifically designed to contain his ionic energy with the Revengers being quickly defeated by the combined Avengers teams, Wonder Man has still successfully managed to spread doubt among the population about the merits of the Avengers as a concept particularly since Captain Rogers has yet to officially rebuff any of his arguments, asking Beast to remember his words simultaneously reflecting that he may be able to see the Avengers from the outside as he has not been 'real' since his resurrection before he apparently disappears from his prison.<ref>''The Avengers'' Annual vol. 4 #1 (January 2012). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Wonder Man later reappears to [[Captain America]] (Steve Rogers), telling him that he feels sorry for his past actions and that he is trying to redeem himself. Before he can accept help from the Avengers, he is attacked by the [[Thunderbolt Ross|Red Hulk]]. He managed to take him down and looks at Avengers Tower, claiming that he will "earn his way back".<ref>''The Avengers'' vol. 4 #31 (December 2012). Marvel Comics.</ref> He later plays a pivotal role in rescuing [[Wasp (comics)|the Wasp]] from the [[Microverse]]. After this, Wonder Man is shown celebrating Jan's return alongside the rest of the Avengers at Stark Tower.<ref>''The Avengers'' #34. Marvel Comics.</ref>

At Wasp's urging, Simon later joins the [[Uncanny Avengers|Avengers Unity Squad]]. During conversations with Jan and [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]], he makes it clear has no intentions of fighting, and only wants to help use his PR skills to win over skeptical citizens.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> He and the Scarlet Witch rekindle their relationship. During the final confrontation with the Celestial Executioner, he allows [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] to absorb him to give her the power to oppose the Celestial,<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' #21. Marvel Comics.</ref> but his essence remains in Rogue after Wanda expels the other absorbed powers from her,<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' #22. Marvel Comics.</ref> leaving Rogue with Simon's powers and once again unable to touch others.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' #23. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the ''[[AXIS (comics)|AXIS]]'' storyline, Wonder Man's consciousness was still in Rogue at the time when the X-Men and the Avengers were inverted by an inversion spell. Rogue used Wonder Man's powers when helping the X-Men.<ref>''Avengers & X-Men: AXIS'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

At the time when the Avengers Unity Squad traveled to Counter-Earth to find Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch, Rogue was captured by High Evolutionary's right-hand man Master Scientist who removed Wonder Man's consciousness from Rogue.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' vol. 2 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After Rogue was unable to see or hear Wonder Man, he was still in Rogue's mind. When Rogue kissed Deadpool, Wonder Man was freed from Rogue's body as the result of Deadpool's healing factor acting like a circuit breaker that enabled Wonder Man to escape from Rogue's body.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' vol. 3 #22-23. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]" storyline, Wonder Man appears as a member of the Underground which is a resistance movement against Hydra ever since they took over the United States.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Empyre]]" storyline, Wonder Man, Quicksilver, and [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]] deal with the [[Kree]] and the [[Skrull]]'s fight with the [[Cotati (comics)|Cotati]] near [[Navojoa]]. When Quicksilver is hit by special spheres fired by the Cotati magicians, Mockingbird and Wonder Man come to his aid and help the Kree and the Skrull turn the tide against the Cotati.<ref>''Empyre: Avengers'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Simon Williams gained his superhuman powers due to chemical and radiation treatments with "ionic" energy by Baron Zemo, giving him superhuman strength, speed, stamina, durability, agility, and reflexes. While Zemo's initial aim is to use ionic energy treatments to make Wonder Man at least "the equal of any Avenger," his treatments surpassed his expectations and endowed Wonder Man with strength comparable to that of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]].<ref>Stated by Zemo in ''The Avengers'' #9 (October 1964) and confirmed by Wonder Man in ''The Avengers'' #176 (October 1978).</ref> In ''Avengers: The Children's Crusade'' #3, Captain America describes Wonder Man as having "Sentry-level" strength. Zemo's treatments also grant Wonder Man virtual invulnerability, immortality, enhanced physicality likened to greater stamina, agility, speed, and instantaneous reflexes. Zemo also outfits Wonder Man with a rocket pack in his belt to achieve flight.<ref>''The Avengers'' #9 (October 1964). Marvel Comics.</ref>

When the Scarlet Witch resurrected him during [[Kurt Busiek]]'s tenure as head writer, Wonder Man was able to transform into a state of pure ionic energy at will and back again.<ref name="auto">''The Avengers Two: Wonder Man and Beast'' (May – July 2000). Marvel Comics.</ref> Following his resurrection and metamorphosis, Wonder Man eventually relearned he is capable of true flight and energy projection.<ref>''Wonder Man'' vol. 2 #5 (Jun3 2007). Marvel Comics.</ref> Due to his self-regenerating ionic energy, Simon has the ability to go without air, food, or water. His eyes also glow a bright red and he usually wears sunglasses to conceal the effect but Simon can normalize their appearance as well.<ref name="auto"/>

Before his "death" at the hands of the Kree,<ref name="Force Works' 1994"/> Wonder Man discovered new abilities. In his beginning years, Williams sometimes wore an ionic energy powered apparatus which allowed him simulated flight.<ref>''Wonder Man'' #1 (September 1991). Marvel Comics.</ref> Over the course of his career he would gain true flight without need of a thrust system.<ref>''Wonder Man'' #26 (October 1993). Marvel Comics.</ref> Other abilities begotten from manipulating his own ion energies include: emitting force or flame beams from his hands and eyes.<ref>''Wonder Man'' #23 July 1993</ref><ref name="ReferenceA">''Wonder Man'' #25 (September 1993). Marvel Comics.</ref>; alternating his physical shape in undiscovered ways either changing his size (enabling him to grow taller than his adversary Goliath) and morphing his hand into a sickle or transforming into a more demonic semblance;<ref name="ReferenceA"/> and withholding the energy in hand to increase the impact force of his physical blows.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> He could potentially even give superpowers to non-powered individuals by imparting his ionic force onto them and can just as easily reabsorb it back into himself as this somewhat weakens his superhuman abilities.<ref>''Wonder Man'' #11-12 (1992). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Since his resurrection, he has rarely used most of these powers but can still shift between human and energy states at will.<ref>''Wonder Man'' vol. 2 #1 (February 2007). Marvel Comics.</ref> In later issues his ionic form has begun to "leak" energy, allowing Iron Man to track him by following his unique energy signature, the other heroes speculating that his condition is responsible for his currently unstable attitude and anger at the Avengers.<ref>''The New Avengers'' Annual vol. 2 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> In later appearances he appears to have increased in strength and power, having also learned to teleport at will. He has done so several times in recent appearances; once being when he was detained by the Avengers after staging an attack on the mansion,<ref>''The Avengers'' Annual vol. 4 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> and again while battling and easily winning against the Red Hulk.<ref>''The Avengers'' vol. 4 #31 (2012). Marvel Comics.</ref> Wonder Man has some limited effect on Electromagnetic phenomena as was explained to him by Hank and Nadia Pym, to that end he can absorb various forms of energy be it radiological,<ref>''The Avengers'' #680 (2018). Marvel Comics.</ref> ionic,<ref>''The Avengers'' vol. 3 #34 (1998). Marvel Comics.</ref> even anti-material in nature.<ref>''The Avengers'' #347 (1992). Marvel Comics.</ref>
