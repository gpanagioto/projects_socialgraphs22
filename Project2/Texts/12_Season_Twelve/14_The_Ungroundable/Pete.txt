What the hell are those kids doing? Are they trying to be Goth? So, all of a sudden you Justin and Britney wannabes think it's cool to dress like us? Really. Do you guys even smoke?  Oh my God. All right, Count Fagula, you go do that.   What? Hey. Hey! We aren't vampire kids, we're freakin' Goths! More preppy straight-A students turning into vampires. What the hell is going on? ...Oh my God. You've got the wrong flippin' people. We aren't trying to be popular! Let's just face it: they bogarted our style! Everyone's gonna think we're trying to be butthole vampires now. We might as well go to the freakin' Gap and just buy normal clothes.  Well, at least nobody can refer to us as vampire kids now.   Let's get out of these freakin' Gap clothes. It's like, there's more vampire kids every freakin' day. Why is this happening, I mean... why now? Whattaya mean? Does your mom know you took her car? Yeah, pull over here.  Well, if he's a vampire, I guess we should drive a stake through his heart. If we get the right packaging, we can just FedEx him somewhere far way. No, he'd probably see it as something to brag about someday to his little vampire buddies. They aren't Goth! They're douchey little vampire kids! I bet they aren't even drinking coffee. Forget it! It's over, all right? There's too many of them now. We can't stop them. Let's just face it. Freakin' vampires beat us. What are you talking about? Awww, Hot Topic? When did this open? How did we not figure that out? Of course a new Hot Topic must have come to town. Duh! Let's get to it.  You should probably get out of here.
