 Hi kids. Hm.  Oh Jesus Christ. Ugh.  Oh Jesus Christ.  Oh-oh. Oh it hurts. AAH. AAH.  Dude! Jesus Christ! AAH!  Well it wasn't the first small animal I put up my ass. Don't forget, I get half. Oooooh!  How'd it go? The principal didn't fire you? Oh, Jesus Christ. Well it sounds to me like the principal's just hiding things from everybody. What ''you'' need to do is let the ''parents'' see what kind of demented faggot you are. Oohoohoohoo, Jesus Christ.   Uh-huc, Jesus Christ. Mm, Just a bit of an upset stomach, I guess. Eugh, Jesus Christ.  Yes, Mr. Garrison? Really? Why would you dream that I was being an asshole? I've got a little- Oof.  Ohoc, Jesus Christ. What's happening in there? Oh! I should have never shoved all those poor animals up my ass!  Yeah, Jesus Christ. Oooo, this could be kind of fun.
