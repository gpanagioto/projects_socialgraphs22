Jimmy, those people you're hanging out with are no good. Uh Jimmy, we've told you before. God made you the way he did for a reason! That's right. You were sent here through the vengeful and angry hand of God to teach your mother and I a lesson. And that's a big responsibility, son.  Sarah! 
 You guys have got to see these shoes I bought! Great idea, Eric! Raise metrosexual awareness! 
Jimmy? Jim, it's your father! Jimmy, were you masturbating? Okay. Well, you have a visitor.  I didn't know you had a girlfriend, Jim. I'll leave you two alone.  Y-You sure you weren't masturbating, Jim? It's okay if you were. Okay, then.  
Jimmy, we understand you're getting erections in the classroom. Mr. Mackey, your counselor. Now, Jimmy, it's nothing to be ashamed of. But we know it's something you might have a hard time talking about. Get it? A hard time. So, we took your counselor's advice 'nd called Doctor Pal to help us all talk about this. A-all right, come on, honey.  
Here is a good place. I'll do it right here. Stop being a scaredy-cat. It will just take a second. How could I get hurt?  A traaain! AAAAAA!  No, no! Nooo! AAAA!!!No, no, no, no, noooo! Learn from me. 
My name is Ryan! My cool cool trick is that I can jump in the air.  
Yup! We've gotta be careful, Gerald. This is a college bar. No. 
Son, I've always tried to be a fair dad. Eh I I don't want to meh make you angry, but... why? Fun? But what do you... believe in? 
Thanks for coming, everyone. I know you are all concerned as Sarah and I are about what's happening to our children. Hey! Get out of my bed! We just wanted you to come share your insights on Facebook! 
Yeah, I got a real cape this year. Check it out.  You know, just getting a bunch of shit for being witches. Hey, what the hell is this? Right. You don't have to worry about us, going around snatching children. Only the other witch does that.  It's too late, Stephen. We called the police. We know you took those children. Everyone will be stoked on us now. 
It's getting pretty hard to keep defending you. Maybe it's time we put our foot down. Well whattaya mean? He's great. We're doing great. A lot of people judge him and just see the negative. People don't know how great the President can be behind closed doors. They don't get to see all his good qualities. Oh. No, I-uh I tripped on a doorknob and uh that's just, that's doorknob cum. Okay, we're safe to talk. Sshh, keep your voices down! Look at this! The latest approval ratings. I've been researching our own independent poll. The President is tanking. These numbers are so low that we just might have an out. Well, don't you guys see what this means? It means that the swing voters are turning against him. It's those people that matter. Those are the ones who can finally turn this thing around! Nothing! Oh, you bitch!  I was the one who researched the poll, Mr. President! Congratulations, Mr. President. 
The whole park could use an upgrade, if you ask me. It's become a campout for the homeless. 
Let me try.  
He's not going to take this well. 
Amazon Boxes?!   Oh. My what? You got a-? Are, are we splitting that? Do you have more?
