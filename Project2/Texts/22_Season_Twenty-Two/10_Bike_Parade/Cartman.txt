Kyle, did you get your stuff?! I got my stuff! Yeah, dude!  Stan and Kenny got their stuff too! Bring it all over to my house! We gotta get ready for the bike parade! There's no way we can't win, you guys. We are going to kill at the bike parade. We finally did it. We worked together, we overcame adversity, and everything is finally gonna be cool again. Yeah, how do we do the changing face of immigrants in America without the Philippines?!  Kenny, no! You can't do this! We've worked so hard, and we've come so close! Oh my G- Oh my God! My anxiety! My anxiety is going off, you guys!  Oh my God! We did so much! We went through all this and he just quits?! That's it! That's it! I'm gonna shoot up the skewl! No, 'cause it's not fair! You work your ass off for nothing, and now my anxiety's back, and I'm gonna shoot up the skeewwwwl! Kyle's right.  We are. It's just Kenny fucked us again. Yeah. Hey. What if there wasn't? What if the bike parade got cancelled? We're never gonna win the bike parade, but if we get cancelled, then everybody loses. How do you get anything cancelled? You bitch about it being insensitive! "What's offensive about a bike parade?" Kyle, you small-minded piece of shit! We should cancel you just for saying that. Everybody loses, you guys! Yeah. We're gonna need poster boards, markers, and lots of glitter and glue. Yeah, how can somebody who gives you whatever you want be a bad guy?  But we're outraged about something. We need glitter and glue. It's just such bullcrap, you guys. How come everything out there is getting cancelled, but when it comes to us, we just can't do it?  That's right. we've been selfish. We can't get the parade cancelled for us. We have to do it for all the other people who want it cancelled, but their voices aren't being heard! Come on! I'm actually pissed off now!  It is nihilistic and out of touch with progressive thinking!  Who would use the bike parade like some $20 hooker?
