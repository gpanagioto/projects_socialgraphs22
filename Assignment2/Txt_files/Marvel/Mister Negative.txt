'''Mister Negative''' is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]], usually as an enemy of [[Spider-Man]], the [[Punisher]], and [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak & Dagger]]. The character was created by [[Dan Slott]] and [[Phil Jimenez]], and first appeared in "Swing Shift", a story in ''Free Comic Book Day: The Amazing Spider-Man'' #1 (May 2007). The name "Mister Negative" is a reference to [[photographic negative]], as the colors of his skin, hair, and costume are inverted when he transforms into his alter ego.

Originally a [[Triad (organized crime)|Chinese gangster]] and [[Snakehead (gang)|human trafficker]], whose real name was never revealed,{{efn|"Martin Li" is the name of a slave who died when the ''Golden Mountain'', the ship Mr. Negative was working on at the time, crashed onto the [[New York City|New York]] shores. His identity was stolen by Mr. Negative, who would continue to pose as a former slave.|name=|group=}} the man who would become Mr. Negative was captured by [[crime boss]] [[Silvermane]] to serve as a test subject, alongside the future Cloak & Dagger, for an experimental procedure involving a synthetic drug created by [[Simon Marshall (comics)|Simon Marshall]]. The experiment gave the character control over both the [[Darkforce]] and [[Lightforce (energy)|Lightforce]], and led to the creation of two polar opposite personalities: '''Mister Positive''', posing as a benevolent and kind [[Philanthropy|philanthropist]] named '''Martin Li''', who would go on to found the F.E.A.S.T. Project as a means to help homeless people; and the ruthless crime lord Mister Negative, who leads the Inner Demons gang in an attempt to take over New York's criminal underworld. Originally, the character was depicted as suffering from [[dissociative identity disorder]], with one personality not maintaining the other's memories, but both personas were later shown to be fully aware of each other's existence. As Mister Negative, his powers include healing, mind-controlling others through "corruption", and charging regular weapons with his energy.

Since his conception, the character has been adapted into several forms of media outside of comics, including animated series and video games.

==Publication history==
Created by [[Dan Slott]] and [[Phil Jimenez]], Mister Negative first appeared in "Swing Shift", a story in ''Free Comic Book Day: The Amazing Spider-Man'' #1 (2007), which was set in the immediate aftermath of the "[[Spider-Man: One More Day]]" storyline. Mister Negative then appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #546 (Jan. 2008), the first issue of the follow-up storyline "[[Spider-Man: Brand New Day|Brand New Day]]".

==Fictional character biography==
Martin Li is introduced with the backstory of an illegal Chinese immigrant from [[Fujian]] province who attempted to travel to America to be with his wife. His mode of transportation, the ''Golden Mountain'', was a slave ship operated by the Snakehead gang as a way to sell Fujian captives as overseas slaves in [[Kenya]]. During a storm, the ship's crew evacuated, leaving the captives alone to make a break for the New York shores. Li was the only survivor and spent the following years building a large fortune and dedicating himself to helping those less fortunate.<ref name="DR:MN#1">{{Cite comic |writer=[[Van Lente, Fred]] |penciller=Gugliotta, Gianluca |inker=[[Lanning, Andy]] |colorist=Pattison, Ronda, Mossa, Andres |letterer=Lanphear, Dave |editor=Wacker, Stephen |story=The Last Stand of Mr. Negative |title=Dark Reign: Mister Negative |volume= |issue=#1 |date=Aug. 2009 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] |location=New York|page=}}</ref>

The story is later revealed to be somewhat false, though only the Mister Negative persona appears aware of it. It is revealed that Mister Negative was actually one of the crew members of the ''Golden Mountain''. When the ship nearly crashed onto the New York shores, he stole the identity of one of the deceased Fujian slaves (the real Martin Li) who was heading to America for the aforementioned reasons. This gang member was eventually captured by the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]] Don [[Silvermane]] and experimented on with a synthetic drug created by Maggia chemist [[Simon Marshall (comics)|Simon Marshall]] that could be more potent than heroin. He escaped with the help of two other experimental [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|inmates]] and soon developed two personalities, the kind-hearted Martin Li and the villainous Mister Negative, the latter of the two developing the ability to generate a [[Darkforce|black electrical energy]] that could be used to heal, control others, or charge objects with his touch. The Mister Negative side dedicated himself to becoming Chinatown's Kingpin of Crime while the Martin Li side attempts to run the F.E.A.S.T. center with humility.<ref name="DR:MN#3">{{Cite comic |writer=Van Lente, Fred|penciller=Gugliotta, Gianluca |inker=Gugliotta, Gianluca |colorist=Pattison, Ronda, Mossa, Andres, Fabela, Antonio |letterer=Lanphear, Dave |editor=Wacker, Stephen |story=Negative Reinforcement |title=Dark Reign: Mister Negative |volume= |issue=#3 |date=Oct. 2009 |publisher=Marvel Comics|location=New York |page=}}</ref>

During the first story of "[[Spider-Man: Brand New Day|Brand New Day]]" storyline, Mister Negative first comes into conflict with Spider-Man when he makes a power play toward taking control of [[New York City|New York]]'s criminal underworld by attempting to wipe out all existing members of the Karnelli and [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]] crime families using a [[DNA]] specific [[bioweapon]] called the "Devil's Breath".

Martin Li endorses Bill Hollister for mayor of New York City, putting him against Randall Crowne, adding him to a list of opponents (many of whom become targets of the villain [[Menace (Marvel Comics)|Menace]]).

Mister Negative eventually comes across [[Eddie Brock]], giving a job at his soup kitchen. A touch from him causes Brock's cancerous cells to completely disappear. Also, remnants of the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] symbiote fused with Brock's white blood cells react with Mister Negative's power, causing [[Anti-Venom (symbiote)|Anti-Venom's]] existence during a conflict with [[Mac Gargan]], the Venom Symbiote's host.<ref>{{Cite comic |writer=Slott, Dan|penciller=[[John Romita Jr.|Romita Jr., John]] |inker=[[Klaus Janson|Janson, Klaus]] |colorist=White, Dean |letterer=Petit, Cory |editor=Brennan, Tom; Wacker Stephen; Brevoort, Tom|story=New Ways To Die, Part Two: The Osborn Supremacy |title=The Amazing Spider-Man |volume= |issue=#569 |date=Oct. 2008 |publisher=Marvel Comics|location=New York|page=}}</ref> After the F.E.A.S.T center is torn apart during the fight between the two, Li discovers from a group of sweatshop workers (from a shop owned by Crowne) that they were experimented on with drugs made at [[Oscorp]].<ref>{{Cite comic |writer=Slott, Dan|penciller=Romita Jr., John|inker=Janson, Klaus|colorist=White, Dean |letterer=Petit, Cory |editor=Brennan, Tom; Wacker Stephen; Brevoort, Tom|story=New Ways to Die, Part Five: Easy Targets |title=The Amazing Spider-Man |volume= |issue=#572 |date=Nov. 2008 |publisher=Marvel Comics|location=New York|page=}}</ref> Later, Mister Negative and his Inner Demons encounter and battle Anti-Venom.

During the 2008–2009 "[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]" storyline, Mister Negative refuses to submit to the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]’s rule of conquest over New York's criminal underworld. During a meeting with Hood's henchman White Dragon, Mister Negative corrupts White Dragon and sends the man to attack the Hood's headquarters. In retaliation, the Hood decides to attack and kill him. [[H.A.M.M.E.R.]] seals Chinatown on Hood's behalf and an all out fight breaks out around Li's estate. Hood's gang gets the upper hand until Spider-Man arrives to rescue Martin.

In the X-Men storyline "Serve and Protect", Mister Negative and his Inner Demons are at San Francisco on attempting to murder a widowed woman who still have a child. When two unidentified heroes, then revealed to be the X-Men [[Rockslide (comics)|Rockslide]] and [[Anole (comics)|Anole]] in disguise, Mister Negative hired [[The Serpents]], and devise a plan to lure them into their traps, then turning then into his pawn into attacking other X-Men as well. Although his plan foiled by Anole's strategy into using a temporary brainwashed Rockslide, Mister Negative releases the rock mutant hero and vow they will meet again on the other side.<ref>''X-Men: To Serve and Protect'' (2011).

During the "Sins Rising" arc, a revived [[Sin-Eater (comics)|Sin-Eater]] steals the powers of Mister Negative and uses it to corrupt the guards at Ravencroft when he targets Norman Osborn.

Mayor Fisk allows Mister Negative to control Chinatown and the Lower East Side.

==Powers and abilities==
It initially appears that Martin Li has no knowledge of his evil side. During "New Ways To Die", Li took Eddie Brock into a back room he calls his inner sanctuary, where he claims to play a game of [[Go (game)|Go]] day by day against an unknown opponent who he has never seen, claiming that he has "learned that it's okay to enjoy the game". When he transforms into Mr. Negative, Li's appearance resembles that of a [[photographic negative]]. He also speaks in a reverse colored [[speech balloon]], although this does nothing to the sound of his voice.

Prior to his transformation, "Martin Li" was a member of the Snakehead gang, whose true name has not yet been revealed. Both the Martin Li and Mr. Negative personas are the result of experimental drug tests done by Maggia chemist Simon Marshall, the same tests that powered [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak and Dagger]] (namely Cloak's association with the [[Darkforce]]). Unlike the two heroes, who were each given a power over light and dark, the gang member was given both a light and dark side. As such, Mr. Negative considers himself an embodiment of black and wickedness and both of his personas view the balance of good and evil as a necessary part of the universe.<ref name="DR:MN#3"/> The two halves, while fully aware of one another's existence, take no steps to interfere with one another, with the Martin Li persona even taking such drastic steps as allowing his bad side to corrupt [[Aunt May|May Parker]] to keep it a secret.<ref name="AMS618"/>

During an encounter in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #621, Mr. Negative displays a degree of superhuman strength high enough to send Spider-Man flying through two buildings with a single blow. Mr. Negative also demonstrates superhuman reflexes during his battle with the Hood, dodging bullets or cutting them in half with his sword. He also has the power to charge up knives and swords with black electrical energy, a form of Darkforce energy, and he can corrupt people he touches in the same manner, bringing them under his control. A corrupted person's clothes change his colors to his photographic negatives, and all who are corrupted praise their new master with proclamations like "Mr. Negative was never born, so he is ever living", or "He is attached to nothing, thus he is one with all."<ref name="DR:MN#1"/> The effectiveness of his corruption varies depending on how good the affected person was before their conversion: White Dragon, a villain himself, gained vastly increased stamina and endurance, but was still easily dispatched (his clothes reverted to normal once he was killed). Conversely, Spider-Man, a hero in every respect, was corrupted into a spiteful and angry villain, despising every value he held dear (even his [[Uncle Ben]]'s memory) and no more above killing.<ref name="DR:MN#2"/> Spider-Man is able to break the hold his malevolent side has over him when he is on the verge of killing [[Betty Brant]], as he remembers the love he once had for her upon getting close. Mr. Negative's corrupting touch appears to be ineffective against beings with supernatural powers, as Hood is unaffected when Negative attempts to corrupt him; Mr. Negative claims that this is because the Hood's soul belongs to [[Dormammu]], a being even darker than he is.<ref name="DR:MN#3"/> It has since been revealed that while Negative can renew his influence on others, he cannot corrupt someone once that individual has broken free of his influence already, allowing Peter Parker to infiltrate his plan by using the fact that he had been corrupted by Negative as Spider-Man without his foe knowing his secret identity.<ref name="asm4-7"/>

Mr. Negative's alternate Martin Li persona seems to have the power to cure others: in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #568, a simple touch from Li completely cures Eddie Brock of his cancer, and combines the remnants of the Venom symbiote in his blood with his white blood cells, creating a new symbiote named [[Anti-Venom (symbiote)|Anti-Venom]] that possesses similar healing powers. Aside from this, homeless people who have stayed at Martin Li's shelter have rapidly recovered from any illnesses or injuries they suffered from. It is possible that his healing touch is supposed to be the opposite of Mr. Negative's corrupting touch. It is revealed that Anti-Venom can be affected by Mr. Negative's energy because it negates his healing ability.

Mr. Negative also has access to advanced technology and secret laboratories, in which he is able to give his subjects medical care far more advanced than that available to the general public.<ref name="Extra1"/>

In the 2018 ''[[Spider-Man (2018 video game)|Spider-Man]]'' game, Mr. Negative also possesses the ability to project powerful electricity-like blasts of negative energy from his hands.

Mister Negative is often accompanied by several [[Henchmen#In popular culture|henchmen]], known as his Inner Demons,<ref name="ASM547"/> who wear Chinese opera masks and use [[high tech]] electrified versions of swords, knuckles and various other Asian weaponry such as [[Gun (staff)|gun staffs]] and [[nunchaku]]s. They are able to regenerate from even the most lethal wounds within a matter of seconds, as they have been shown almost immediately recovering from impalement, gunshots to the head, and even getting torn apart or decapitated. It has been implied that the Inner Demons can be killed under the right circumstances: at one point, Anti-Venom claims to have killed some of them, possibly by suffocation, which he later notes to be an effective tactic against them.<ref name="Extra2"/> Mr. Negative also orders the murder of two Inner Demons who have failed him.{{issue|date=December 2010}}
