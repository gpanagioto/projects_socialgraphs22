Eric, as you might have heard, a student here in South Park Elementary had an accident in the classroom. Oookay, but you probably understand that for Pete, it isn't that funny. For him it's embarrassing and terrifying. Eric, it has been almost one year since Corey Duran defecated in ''his'' pants here in school. Now, you remember what happened to him? Please just let it go.  Alright Eric, here's the deal: This school cannot have another suicide on its hands. We want you to see Pete Melman through this, and turn public opinion around. If Pete Melman does not kill himself,  we will make it very worth your while. ...The Doctors say that Jenny Simon barely survived the fall. Jumping off the school roof fractured her pelvis.  That's wasn't the point, Eric! Nobody was supposed to kill themselves! Unless you fix this our deal is off! That's insane! You sure this will work, Eric? What if some of the students don't eat the pizza? Okay, Eric, you got what you wanted. Are we straight? Alright, are we sure we're alone? This story hasn't gone up on Eavesdropper yet. Maybe it won't! No, no, we're not bad. What's a bigger story than all the students being made sick?
