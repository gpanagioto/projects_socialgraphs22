We've never been to a marijuana farm before. Randy... I hope you didn't invite us here because we're black. What do you mean? People have a problem with Tolkien's name? I wanted to name my son after my favorite author. But she didn't want to name our son J.R.R., so we just named him Tolkien. Yes, you know his name is Tolkien! Sorry, I don't think it's that weird. J.R.R. Tolkien is one of the most prolific, influential writers of our time. What did you think his name meant? It's... uh, very involved. Randy, I have a job. I'm a very successful co-executive of a financial consulting firm. Well that's what we do... Sure. No. What the fuck?  What the hell are you doing? No– why is my face on a billboard?! You said you just needed someone to help with accounting! I told you before that I'm not interested in the marijuana business. I don't believe in drinking or doing drugs. You really think we could make a lot of money together?  Hey, guys, I've got something really exciting to show you! I had this awesome idea last night... and I couldn't even sleep, I thought it was so cool–  We do seven different strains in all, representing the dwarves, the elves, even the uruk hai!  Randy, you seem not to care very much about any of my ideas. I don't seem to be the anything guy. I thought we were Ben and Jerry. Well, I don't want to just be here like some kind of... token black person. No. I totally get now why you want me around, and I'm not gonna do it.  Oh, hey, Randy. What'dya think of the new place? Well, y'all came to the right business, cuz this shit is hard! Hell yeah, we got all kinds of shit– Lemme give you a sample of my Rivendell Elvish Magic...  Hey man, what's your problem?!  Game on, muthafucker.
