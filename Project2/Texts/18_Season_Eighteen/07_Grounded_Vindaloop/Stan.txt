 Butters, what the hell are you doing? Sound pretty typical to me. Poor Butters. Can't you just leave him alone? Kyle, maybe this is for real. In on what?  Fuck you! "Fuck you" what? Oh fuck you! No, listen, I called Customer Service because I need help!  It's neither. I know this might be hard for you to grasp right now, but this is all actually real. No dude, dude. We've all been here the entire time. How do you know? What was the name of the first person who called you for customer service? Butters called Customer Service first? Come on, we're going to Butters' house!  Butters. So now we ''are'' in the real world. Yes, we're here.  Well then how much of what just happened was in virtual reality? What?!  That doesn't make sense!  Yes! Yes, you have answered all my questions and I am pleased with the customer service I have been provided!!  You guys? Are you there? Yeah I remember. I'm heading back to the access point.  Alright, I'm nearing Checkpoint Alpha. You guys still there?  Okay, I'm back in Cartman's room.  It's pretty cool, but the graphics suck.
