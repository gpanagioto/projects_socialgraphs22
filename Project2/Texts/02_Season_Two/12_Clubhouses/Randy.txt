Uh oh! No, I was just uh flipping through the channels. Okay. Uh, you just get a hammer and some wood. What? Uh some girls wanna play Truth or Dare or something? How do you think I met your mother? Oh, brother. Yeah, Stanley, you should know better.  Okay, okay. Give me a second, would you? I didn't snap at you. Whatever. I-I don't wanna fight, I'm sorry. Uh I think I found it. Hey, back off, bitch! Did I? Stanley, I... Skylarkings? Stanley, I want you to explain to me why you were passing notes in school. You need to shape up, mister.  I don't interrupt you. Okay, I'm sorry I interrupt. But she always takes over any conversation! When was the last time you had anything interesting to say? It's always gossip and stupid crap! Well- uh, I feel like everything I do is wrong, it doesn't matter what I say. Oh, please! No, she is. Hey, Stanley, uh, hop in. Listen, Stanley, I- I know all this change must be tough on you, but you know, your-your mother and I thought it'd be best for all of us if we'd split up. Well, hello, ladies.  I'm already there. What were we talking about? Oh yeah. See, your mother and I still care about you and your sister. But we just don't like being around each other any more. Well, no, because you're a family. You just can't leave family; you have to stick with family, no matter what. Hoho, Stan, you're so young. You just don't get it. Well, anyway, have a nice day. Yeah. But I loved our time together. I hate to see it end. Go on, get out. You know that nothing is more important to me than you, right, Stan? Oh boy, it's getting late. I'm gonna have to leave this party. I, uh, got a note from Stanley to come out to the-uh clubhouse. Oh, maybe it was. I remember not too long ago we were just kids playing kissing games in my clubhouse. Sharon? Truth or Dare? No, I'm serious, please. Truth or Dare? Do you still love me? Well, you never know. Maybe--  --thing will work out.  Dare.
