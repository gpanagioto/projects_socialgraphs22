Hello there children. How you doin'? Why bad? Ahhhh, of course they won't splice children. Haven't you ever heard that song by 'Loverboy'? Imagine, a pint sized elephant that you could keep in the house. Children, we could make a fortune with this. Forget about all that genetic engineering whoosafudge. If you want to combine a pig and an elephant, just get them to make sweeet love. Sure they would. But you're gonna have to get 'em in the mood. Do what I do, get 'em goood and drunk. Hello children. I thought I'd check and see how our little entrepreneurial venture is going. Ohh, children, you just can't stick a drunk pig with a drunk elephant, and, and, expect them to do the mattress mambo. You need to set the mood. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Elton John! Thank you Elton. <poem><i>Tonight is right for love, love graaavaaaaaay.</i></poem> Now children, gather around, and watch the wonders of life. The beauty of Mother Nature. Hmm, now I know how all those ''white'' women must have felt. Oh, they will. It's gonna be one uuuugly sight. Usually about 9:30 in the morning, children. Uh oh, here we go. Yeahhh, there's nothing worse than getting all drunk and waking up the next morning next to a pig. Or a big fat elephant. Well boys, we might not know that for a couple of days. Hey, you're that crazy cracker from up on the hill.
