Token sings? Wow, two hundred dollars. Can you imagine? Yeah. We're too smart to be talented. Hey yeah! We deserve that money just as much as he does. He's looking at the sign. All right. It's genius.  Ohhhh Token. Right, yeah, you're makin' a smart move, man. You guys, we're gonna lose our client.  Look, Token, here's the bottom line. You're gonna start having a lot of offers comin' at you from all directions. A media storm is about to hit you and ''you'' can't handle it on your own. Nobody can. This thing in Denver is is just the crust, Token. With our support, you can have the whole pie. Ah Kenny, Token just signed with us! Oh, you're interested in hiring our client? You were awesome, Token! This is just the beginning. I bet we start to see all kinds of offers comin' in for Token now.  Uh excuse me, Token already has representation. So unfair... so unfair. Huh? You were looking for a talent agent? And what does she do? Uh, we're sorry dude, but getting her career off the ground would take too much work for us. Yeah! Hi, Mr. Lu Kim? Uh hi, it's Wing's agents. Everything's fine, yeah, but we're supposed to arrive in Los Angeles in about four hours. Listen, does your wife ever eat? Or anything? Uhh, all right. We'll call you after she goes on TV. Uh sure, here she is.  There it is! American Idol contestants! Ah our client has an audition to this show. Oh no, no no no, come on!  Excuse me, ma'am. No, I don't think you understand. We're here with Wing. That's right, ''the'' Wing.  We can't wait in line! We have to be in school on Monday! We have someone who's ready to go on TV right away! All right, our client will do it! What's "The Contender"? Go Wing!  Anyone? Help four boys and a Chinese woman get back to Colorado? Oh, thanks. You do?  We won't!  You guys, you guys! Sylvester Stallone wants Wing to sing at his son's wedding tomorrow! He's gonna pay her four thousand dollars! Yeah! Whoa whoa, wait, wait. ...where's Wing?  ...Oh Jesus Christ. If that big CAA talent agency finds out she has work, they're gonna try to steal her away from us again. Oh no!   Two four nine all right, this is the place. Hello? We want to talk to somebody right now! You tell 'em, Kyle! Jesus, they really want Wing as their client! No! Screw that, dude! If we keep letting CAA take all our clients, we're never gonna make it as talent agents! We've gotta split up and find Wing! You and Kenny go that way!  You bastards! Yeah, you wouldn't kill her, 'cause then she can't pay you money! We know because we're in the same business you are!  Guys! Guys! Guys! Don't you see what we're doing? Jesus... we're not talking about an object here, we're, we're talking about a person. I mean, look at what we've all become. All this violence and anger and, and for what? For control over somebody's life who... w-we're all just trying to leech off of. Wing doesn't belong to us ''or'' to you. We're all just caught up in a business that treats people like commodities. It's a lousy business. I quit. I think we all learned it's best to leave talent to the talented people.
