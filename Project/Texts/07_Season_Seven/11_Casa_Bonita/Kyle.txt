 You guys! You guys! I have awesome news! No. This Saturday, for my birthday, my Mom says she's takin' me to Casa Bonita, in Denver, and I get to invite three friends! It's like the Disneyland of Mexican restaurants. Who said I'm inviting you?  Yes. Three friends. You're not my friend. I'm gonna take Butters. He invited me to ''his'' birthday party last month, so I owe him one. Because Butters isn't a total dick to me!  Oh please! All you ever do is call me names and rip on me for being Jewish!  "I told you Jewish people don't have rhythm." "Fuck off, Cartman!" You've always been a dick to me, Cartman, and I'm not inviting you. ''[turns and walks away, but Cartman stays close'']  Sorry, my mind's made up. I'm not inviting you, Cartman. You can't go.  That isn't it, Cartman. That's not being nice! That's just putting on a nice sweater! I know you don't.  Do you really think that beating up a handicapped kid is being nice?  Yeah, Casa Bonita, this Saturday!  Well? How are you going to try to get invited to Casa Bonita ''this'' time? Oh. Well... yeah. I, I did. I'm still not inviting you to Casa Bonita. Eh... hey, Cartman?  You really don't care that you can't go? That's exactly what I wanted to hear from you all along. Ah uh I still have to take Butters, but... I hope things can be cool too. And, and hey, if for some reason Butters can't go to Casa Bonita, you can take his place. Where is Butters? We were supposed to leave here forty minutes ago. Yeah, screw him. Let's go.  Oh. Thanks, dude. Oh wait. Cartman. Uh Butters didn't show. You wanna go to Casa Bonita with us? I told him 5:30 and we gotta get going. You in? All right, let's go. Butters was supposed to go with us to Casa Bonita tonight. Aw dude, weak. Nah. Dude, I c-I can't go to have a birthday party while Butters is missing. Nah, I can't. We should help look for him. Yeah. And then we can try the football field.  Yeah, it's pretty cool. Oh, awesome. What? What?  I should have known better! You never cared about my birthday at all! It's too late, fatass.  They'll be here in less than a minute.  Cartman! Cartman!  Jesus Christ! ''[Cartman ends up face down in the water, which isn't deep enough to drown him. He flips over and coughs.''
