Yes, they made a copy of me and they don't want me around anymore. They're about to do something big, and they need famous artists to be controlled for it. Me! Oh right, I forgot to tell you that part. I'm actually Lorde. No! That was a copy of me! Look, I don't know what they're up to, but these people have something much darker planned! Mr. Jackson, it's me, Lorde. Please. Do you know what's going on here? What are the producers trying to do? A holiday special. Oh my God.  Can you help me stop them?! Then we'll do it together. I love children just as much as you do. We don't really use this thing anymore.  It hasn't started yet! Alright, Sharon, get on your computer upstairs! Mr. Jackson, you can take the one in my son's room! We've got to tell people the truth! Oh my God... My daughter... She has no idea that I'm Lorde... I can't let her find out from the Internet. I have to tell her the truth before we all tell the world. I guess... one step at a time. Shelly? Um, I'm Lorde. Whew, that was hard.  Stanley?! YOU LEAVE HIM OUT OF THIS! THEY'VE GOT STAN! JUST STAY HERE WITH MICHAEL JACKSON!
