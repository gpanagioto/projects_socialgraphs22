 It ''is'' real. They do it every year. But everyone in town tries to be the first inside the mall on Black Friday. What chance do we have? The House of Greyhawk? I like the PS4's controller better.  because that's how XBox people are.  If I see you at the mall, Kyle, I will have to try to beat you inside. We come seeking your help. Do you side with those wanting XBoxe's, or will you join us on Black Friday and fight for PS4s? Then join us! We need people to help us be the first 20 inside the mall! No, you can't do that! Don't you see this is about more than Black Friday? Battle lines are being drawn! If you wait it out, but everyone else has already decided to go with XBox, then, that will become the standard! The PS4 would be like Betamax was to VHS. Exactly! ...Look, we're just asking people who want to play on PS4s to fight for what they believe in! And who do we have on our side? Did you ask the Vamp kids?  So we're just gonna let other kids decide which game system we all play on? What would they do on Game of Thrones? What would they do when things look their darkest? When we started this fight... it was because we were tired of XBox people telling us Playstation sucks! Now... we have an army of our own!
