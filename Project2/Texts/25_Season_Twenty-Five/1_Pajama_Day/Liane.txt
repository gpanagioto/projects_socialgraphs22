 it's okay! What's wrong?! Shh! Eric! Eric, it's okay, sweetie. Shh. Uh, yes, I understand that you told my child that he isn't allowed to wear pajamas this Friday? What is this, Nazi Germany? Well, I'm sorry, but I don't think it's safe for Eric to not wear his pajamas on pajama day. He could die. Well, I'm not really sure where you get off telling me what my son can and can't wear. What do you think about that? In fact, I think you can fuck off. Uh, I can just keep him home on pajama day? Matt Damon told me fortune favors the brave, and I lost all my fucking money! I'm going to rally all the parents, and I'm going to the press! If my son can't wear his pajamas to school, then no kids are going to wear their pajamas to school!
