What are you doing here, little boy? Lost in the rainforest? Oh, my Lord! Where are all the others? Chicken wings! Quick! Everybody help the children!  Come on! Let's get you back to civilization! Your little friend helped me out. We're clearing out big sections of the rainforest for a lumberyard. You mean, you don't mind? Thatâ€™s swell!
