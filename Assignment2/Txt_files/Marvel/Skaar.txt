==Fictional character biography==
Skaar is the son of the Hulk and Caiera the Oldstrong. He was conceived during the Hulk's time on Caiera's home planet of Sakaar. Following the Hulk's departure from the planet, Skaar emerged from a cocoon with the appearance and age equivalency of a human preteen. He matured rapidly, achieving a teenage appearance in just one year. Soon after, Skaar developed the appearance and intelligence of a full-grown adult.<ref>[[Pak, Greg]]. "Cradle of Fire" ''Skaar, Son of Hulk'' #1; Marvel Comics; August 2008</ref> To survive, Skaar learned the need to kill as part of his upbringing by the savage creatures of his home planet. He demonstrates himself to be a fierce and capable general, becoming the enemy of Axeman Bone. He later gains the power of the stone-based "Old Power", which allow him to draw energy from the planet itself.{{fact|date=August 2022}}

Skaar was able to communicate with the spirit of his supposedly dead mother, Caiera. He fights a war against Axeman Bone but this only delays his people's escape from the near destruction of the planet by [[Galactus]], the devourer of worlds. Because the planet possesses enough energy to satiate Galactus' hunger for a hundred thousand years, Caiera takes the Old Power from Skaar as she tries to reason with him.<ref>Pak, Greg. "Return of the Silver Savage" ''Skaar: Son of Hulk'' #7; Marvel Comics; March 2009</ref> Skaar admits to Caiera that he wanted to clear the evil from the planet. However, the [[Silver Surfer]] restores Skaar's Old Power and shows him a vision of the death and destruction of Sakaar leading Skaar to destroy the evacuation ships. He tells the Surfer that if he does not spare his planet, he will use the Old Power to increase Galactus' hunger and endanger more planets, including those already saved by the Surfer. After the Surfer informs the people of Sakaar that their safety would lead to the death of countless planets, he departs. Caiera denounces Skaar for his decision and absorbs his Old Power. She then exiles him from Sakaar and waits for Galactus to consume her.<ref>Pak, Greg. ''Skaar: Son of Hulk'' #10. Marvel Comics. June 2009</ref>

Skaar arrives on Earth with the sole desire to kill his father, the Hulk. After conflicts with the [[United States Armed Forces|United States military]], the [[Fantastic Four]] and the [[Warbound]], he confronts the Hulk. Unbeknownst to Skaar, the Hulk has changed since his time on Sakaar. After the Hulk engages Skaar, he effortlessly beats him but their fight creates a fissure that endangers a nuclear power plant. Skaar ceases his attack when he realizes that this Hulk is not the "War Hulk" that conceived him, the one he desires to kill. He prevents the fissure from endangering the power plant and declares Earth to be his new home.{{fact|date=August 2022}}

Skaar later encounters Bruce Banner, who had been robbed of the ability to become the Hulk by the [[Red Hulk]]. Skaar reiterates his desire to kill the Hulk, but he cannot accomplish this by killing him in Banner's form as they had separated into two distinct personas. Bruce offers to teach Skaar how to kill the Hulk, should he ever return. But this is a ruse to allow Banner to monitor his "son", and impart fatherly wisdom in the hope of turning the savage warrior into a hero. Skaar demonstrates his ability to use both cunning and physical strength by hurling the villain Juggernaut into outer space.<ref>Pak, Greg. "Banner's Back" and "Play Date". ''Incredible Hulk'' #601-602. Marvel Comics. October - November 2009</ref> Subsequent lessons by Banner include encounters with [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], Wolverine's son, [[Daken]], [[Victoria Hand (comics)|Victoria Hand]], [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]], a mutated [[Marlo Chandler]], [[Tyrannus (comics)|Tyrannus]], the [[Mole Man]] and his army of [[Moloids]].<ref>Pak, Greg.

After defeating the Moloids, Skaar is proclaimed a hero and a parade is held in his honor. Banner confronts the Red Hulk but grows angry. He then [[Teleportation|teleports]] to the country of [[Latveria]], supposedly to transform in private but a battle breaks out between the Hulk and Latverian king [[Doctor Doom]]. Skaar soon intervenes with the aid of his father's teleportation technology as he wants to prevent Doom from robbing him of the ability to kill the Hulk. Doom overpowers Skaar with magic, reverting him to his human form and revealing that this Hulk is a robot. Banner then arrives to rescue his son, seeing him in his human form for the first time. But Skaar rejects Banner's affection, believing that Banner cares only for his deceased wife. Skaar concludes that his discovery of the teleporter and trip to Latveria are part of another of Banner's "lessons", and reiterates his desire to someday kill him in his Hulk form.<ref>Pak, Greg. "Dark Son". ''Incredible Hulk'' #606. Marvel Comics. October 2010</ref>

During the "[[Fall of the Hulks]]", "[[World War Hulks]]", and "Dark Son" storylines, Skaar comes to the aid of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] by battling the [[Red She-Hulk]] in a story that involves the villainous group Intelligencia capturing Banner and turning people in [[Washington, D.C.]], into Hulks, including the genius [[Amadeus Cho]].<ref>Pak, Greg. "Unbound" ''Incredible Hulk'' #607; Marvel Comics; April 2010</ref><ref>Pak, Greg. "Endgame". ''Incredible Hulk'' #608. Marvel Comics. May 2010</ref> Later in the story, Banner re-emerges as the Green Scar, prompting Skaar, who has finally been granted the confrontation he longs for, to attack him. As they fight, Hulk rescues many innocent bystanders endangered by the battle. Skaar reacts to his father's compassion by ceasing his own assault and reverting to human form, but Hulk continues fighting. His actions quickly remind him of Banner's [[Brian Banner|own abusive father]], reverting him back to his human form. Banner embraces his son, who is finally willing to accept his love.<ref>Pak, Greg. "Dark Son". ''Incredible Hulk'' #611. Marvel Comics. March 2010.</ref> Skaar then sets out on a journey with his father, [[She-Hulk (Lyra)|sister]], first cousin once removed Jennifer Walters, Rick Jones, and Betty Ross. Soon after, he senses his brother, Hiro-Kala, approaching Earth.<ref>Pak, Greg. "Dark Son". ''Incredible Hulk''. #611-613. Marvel Comics. October - December 2010</ref>

During the "[[Chaos War (comics)|Chaos War]]" storyline, Skaar helps his father and his friends in their fight against the forces of Amatsu-Mikaboshi.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #618-619. Marvel Comics.</ref> When it is discovered that [[Brian Banner]] has been brought back from the dead and has become a [[Guilt Hulk]]/[[Devil Hulk]] hybrid, Skaar helps his father fight his grandfather.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #620. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Skaar accompanies the Hulk and the Warbound to the [[Savage Land]] when they are contacted by [[Ka-Zar (Kevin Plunder)|Ka-Zar]] regarding the death of some Sakaarians who were living there.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #622. Marvel Comics.</ref> They discover that the insectoid [[Miek]] is involved in a plot to use Sakaarian bodies to store his hatchlings.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #623.

Following Miek's apparent death, Skaar remains in the Savage Land to keep an eye on the remaining Sakaarians.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #625. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Skaar is recruited by [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] to join the second incarnation of the [[Dark Avengers]].<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 2 #18. Marvel Comics</ref> His first fight with the team goes against him when the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] discover them.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 2 #19. Marvel Comics.</ref> After the Dark Avengers reveal that they have captured Captain America and are planning to capture the other Avengers to put on trial, Skaar turns on his teammates.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 2 #22. Marvel Comics.</ref> It is revealed at that point that Skaar is actually a double agent. He then frees Captain America while the New Avengers defeat the remaining Dark Avengers.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 2 #23. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Skaar later travels back to the Savage Land as it reminds him of his home planet. The Hulk in his Doc Green form tracks Skaar there in order to depower him as part of his plan to depower every Gamma mutate on Earth. After a brief fight, Skaar is finally depowered. Doc Green teleports Skaar to Paris along with a backpack full of money so he can start a new and better life under the alias "Santos".<ref>''Hulk'' Vol. 3 #7. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Abomination's company Green Spring later repowers Skaar. While working for Green Spring, Skaar is dispatched to retrieve the escaped gamma mutate Stockpile.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Ewing, Al]]; [[Frasier, Crystal]]|artist=Medina, Lan|title=[[Gamma Flight]]|story=Someone Bigger|issue=1|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|date=August 2021}}</ref> This puts Skaar into conflict with the group [[Gamma Flight]], which comes to Stockpile's defense, and the U.S. Hulkbuster Force, which was formed to stop the threat of the gamma mutates. Skaar easily defeats the U.S. Hulkbuster Force, but spares its members' lives.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Ewing, Al]]; [[Frasier, Crystal]]|artist=Medina, Lan|title=[[Gamma Flight]]|story=Without Mercy|issue=2|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|date=September 2021}}</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Skaar has powers inherited from both his parents, although this original set had been drained ever since. Like his father, the Hulk, he possesses immense strength, stamina, durability, and healing, as well as enhanced senses. His strength increases whenever enraged such that he could break the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]]'s armor,<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' Vol 2 #602 (November 2009)</ref> although he was not so strong as the Savage Hulk persona. From his mother, Caiera, Skaar can channel these tectonic energies from the planet, granting him mastery over [[lava]] and stone with Old Power – a synthesized form of the [[Galactus|Power Cosmic]], but highly unstable.<ref>''Son of Hulk'' Vol 1 #15 (November 2009)</ref> [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] is able to daze him with a powerful chi-punch.<ref>''The New Avengers'' vol. 2 #20. Marvel Comics.</ref> He could also revert to a human form when calm or otherwise incapacitated. However, in Skaar's birth cocoon, he emerged from within the depth of "[[Magma|burning waters]]" and became resistant to its intense heat.<ref>''Skaar: Son of Hulk'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Other versions==
In the 2007 ''[[List of What If issues#Sixth Series (2007)|What If?]]'' storyline "What if Caiera the Oldstrong had survived the destruction of Sakaar instead of the Hulk?", a 21-year-old version of Skaar appeared near the end, partially seen and obscured by shadows.{{issue|date=November 2011}}
