You just keep all your flag burnin' and your hippie-rock protest songs on YOUR side of the town! Well you can come to our side of town to use the post office and we can go to your side to use the grocery store. W-hell, naturally you could cross the line for that. Just like ...we could cross the line for hardware, supplies, gas, and pharmaceutical needs. All right, that's fine! Because our war support songs will be a thousand times better! Yeah! The last thing these people want is a bleedin'-heart rock protest song!
