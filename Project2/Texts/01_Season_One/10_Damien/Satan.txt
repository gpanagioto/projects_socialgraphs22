Hic dominus ampullicus unum sum. Forante onlisam dum sameli etludemus. Forante onlisam dum sameli etludemus. Yeah. Puny Son of Jehovah! Prepare to enter thy House of Pain! Son of God, I will smash thy face into small little bits! I have such delightful horrors to unleash upon thee. Let the new prince be decided on Saturday. First South Park, then the world. I will crush him like a little bug! Come on, you little wuss, ''fight!'' Throw a punch! Fight, dammit! Come on, sissy. Hit me! ''Hit me!'' Ooooooh, you got me. Fools! You are all fools! Of course I took a dive. Don't you see? Who do you think was the one person that bet on Jesus to win? ''Me'', you idiots! And now I will take all your hard-earned money, and return to Hell a much richer Prince of Darkness, and buy some realty. HA HA HA HA HAA!  Farewell, fools!
