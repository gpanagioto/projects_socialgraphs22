Dude, Jambu is the best!  Let's just stay here and watch the whale swim around some more. Dude, everyone's leaving! We can walk right up to the tank and really study him. I'll meet up with you guys in a little bit. I-I wanna hang out here some more. Jambu? Jambu?  Cool! It worked! Hey, Jambu.  Who said that? No way!  South Park. What do you wanna talk about? Rocket ships? Why? Aren't you happy here? This is amazing! But wait right here. I've gotta go tell my friends about this!   Hey you guys! You guys are not gonna believe this! Dude, he talks! The orca whale talks! I went up to Jambu's tank and I tapped three times like the trainer did. Jambu swam up and started talking to me about rocket ships! Come on! You gotta check it out!  Jambu! Jambu, I'm back!  Ja- Jambu? Are you still feelin' lonely here? He talked! I swear to Abraham he talked, and he loves rocket ships! Goddammit, say something! Jambu! Jambu, why didn't you speak up before? Sick? Oh my God... That's terrible! Alright guys, listen up! This may sound a little strange, but, the whale, at the Denver Sea Park, is going to die, unless we get it to the moon, The whale's name is Willzy-x, and he told us he's dying on our planet. We've come up wth a plan, but we're gonna need all of your help to make it work. Weh-well, why didn't you tell anybody? Well you're NOT crazy. The whale talked to all of us. And he needs our help getting him home. Nobody else is going to help him, you guys. We've got a chance to do something pretty special here. Are you with us? Stan?  Shhh. Willzy-x, don't say anything. We're gonna bust you out of here. Hi. My name's Kyle. Uh, I understand that your country flies people into space for money. I need to book one trip to the moon, please. Right away. You can? Awesome!  Are you nuts? We don't have that kind of money. But you need to understand: we have a whale here that needs to get back to his family on the moon. They want twenty million dollars. All right, look, there's gotta be other Third-World countries with space programs. We've gotta split up and find someplace cheaper, that's all. I can't, Mom. We're working on our school project. Okay ma, thanks!  Yes, yes, hello? Is this Mr. Su-gi-yama with the Japanese space program?  Hello? Jimmy, any luck at the Chinese Embassy? Ten million?? Well that's more than the Germans want! Damnit!  Tell me what to do, Willzy-x! How do we get you home?? Yeah... He must be really sick.  Hang on Willzy-x. There's still hope. Stan and Craig might still luck with the space program down in Mexico. Hang on, Willzy-x. Hang on, buddy. Hang on, Willzy-x. We'll in Mexico soon!. Huh? You don't understand! Willzy-x is from the moon! He'll die if we don't get him back, now! Willzy-x, you ''have'' to talk! Come on boy, you have to! I know you're sick, but you could do it! No! Please, we have to go! But... we were so close... I'm sorry, Willzy-x. We tried. All right!! It belongs with its family! Tijuana, Mexico! You're going home, Willzy-x!  Willzy-x, I think we're here. Come on, guys!  Hang on.  Get him in the water!  We did it! All right. Thanks for your help, dudes.  Well, we did it, guys. It wasn't easy, but... we did a really amazing thing. I don't know, but at least from now on, every time we look at the moon, we can know that Willzy-x is up there, dancing with the other zypods in his castle.
