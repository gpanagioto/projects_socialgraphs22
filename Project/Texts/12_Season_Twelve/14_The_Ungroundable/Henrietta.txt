Why are they all dressing like that all of a sudden? But they can't dress like that. That's our style. You kids need to all go put your freakin' Banana Republic clothes back on, right now! You guys, I do not wanna be grouped in with douchey, little vampire kids. Get out of our space, you little twerps! It seems like that preppy Mike Makowski kid started all this. Maybe he's the way to stopping it. I mean, what do you do when you want to change vampires back to normal? You get rid of the head vampire. Do I care? If we're gonna send him somewhere, it should be the most horrible, most miserable place on Earth. He must not have been what was causing it. It must be something else. Leave us alone! Let's go over there and tell them they're not taking Village Inn from us too. Get away, douchebag. Well, I think we all know what has to be done.
