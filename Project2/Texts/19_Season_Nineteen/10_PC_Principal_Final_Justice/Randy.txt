What? Why wouldn't I be able to pass the garlic bread?  What, wait. Where was I what? Out, with friends, doing things.  On stuff to do, things.  Um, oh I'm gonna take some of this with me. I'm still hungry. Jee-sus! What? Am I on trial or something? God-damn!  Alright, we're good. Nobody suspects a thing. '' Not human? Then what? Oh my God. Don't you see what this means? If something not human is gentrifying the entire world, soon no human will be able to afford it. They're trying to price our species out of existence. There has to be something. Some clue as to what we're dealing with. That sounds like vampires to me. Stan, what the hell are you doing in here? Nothing. We're just hanging out, talking about Coldplay, alright? What are you doing with that? Stan, it isn't what you think. Look, I need to show you something, okay? You need to see this, son.  Ohh! Psych! Now put the fucking gun down, bitch! Oh yeah? You go tell her! I'll tell her you had a gun! You'll be in more trouble than me!  Stan! I am your dad. Put the gun down and sit over there. Shit!  I'm warning you: you're on the wrong side of this! We're just trying to get answers! He pulled one on me first, Sharon!  Stanley, let your mother and I deal with this!  Whoa! Whoa, Shelly! Put down the gun, Shelly! Shelly, put it down, now! I want to, Shelly! I just sometimes feel like you hate me!   Alright. I'll tell you everything.  Yes. They wanted to use his PC as a means to start gentrification in our town. When the pussy-crusher story came out in Super School News, it started to make PC Principal question himself. He started digging for answers. They didn't like that, so they tried to distract and mislead him. With this.   Well then, it's time to go ask Kyle why he sold out his own kind. We're going to kill him with kindness. But instead of kindness we're going to use guns. Come on, let's go!  Shelly, you take care of Grandpa! Nonono, don't shoot Grandpa, just literally take care of him.  Nobody move!  Listen to me, everyone! There are beings who are purposely gentrifying the Earth so that humans can no longer afford it! We've been looking for Kyle Broflovski! Somebody's hiding him!  Classi? An ad? Woah, flippin' ads! They're such a pain in the ass! Mackey? We all could be better people! All of us! We all played a part! If only we'd had these before, huh? Well, I guess there's just one last thing to take care of. Why did it have to be like this?! Why couldn't we try to live on this planet together?! Maybe we're not perfect beings, but we built a better town. We didn't need you to do that! And we'll keep on trying to make it better! Go on, get outta here! We know! Others will know!
