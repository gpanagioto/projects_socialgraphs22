Okay people, listen up. As we near the top of the mountain, the chances of our encountering some lava becomes great. Therefore, I have special-ordered this training film to assist us in volcano safety. Mr. Garrison, if you would please. OK, any questions? That's enough out of you! This isn't happening. Everyone look away please. Nothing to see here.
