A hundred thousand dollars?  Did you guys hear that?! A hundred thousand dollars for a picture of Britney. It's gotta be the Komfort Inn. It's the nicest hotel in South Park. Cartman, go get your camera. A hundred thousand for a picture of Britney peeing on a ladybug. Imagine what a photo of her crapping on a squirrel is worth! Excuse us, we're trying to get a picture of Britney Spears!  We uh, we have special permission? We did it guys! Ahall right! All right. Butters, go get next to her. All right, fine! We don't need you, Butters! How could we know she would... Aw we suck so hard. Whew. Doctor, could we talk to her for a minute? Oh my God! Oh, yeah. Yeh-yeah. It's a-it's not even noticeable.  Oh, God, what have we done?!  Oh crap!  What?! Excuse me, is this really what you think she should be doing right now? Aw come on now, people!  Dude, where in the world can Britney Spears go where nobody will bother her? Platform 4F. Uhhh, it must be on the other side of the station. Yes they are! I have an idea.  I'm not Britney Spears, all right?! Now, wait a minute! Everyone just stop for ''one minute''!  Look, you guys are gonna end up killing her. Can't you see that Britney isn't in any condition to handle this crap anymore? I know watching celebrities go down can be fun. Me and my friends are just as guilty as all of you, but maybe, we'll just, maybe, ...it's time to let this one go. Just this one time, let's, let's all stop before it's too late, huh?  What is going on?! Why do you want Britney Spears to die?! NO! You mean everyone has been wanting Britney Spears to kill herself?  Who's everyone?! Who all is in on this?! Mom, Dad!  They're gonna kill her! They're going to in-. Wait, what are you doing here? Be a good boy? You know all about this? She's been built up to be sacrificed, Stan! Corn harvest!
