This is so retarded, Cartman. You've got everyone believing your stupid story. Just admit you were lying, Cartman, so that everyone can go home! This is fucking retarded! Yeah, and if you ''couldn't'' prove there was a leprechaun, you have to give me ten dollars! Now just pay up and stop being stupid! Okay, that's enough.  Everybody! Cartman is just pulling one of his stupid tricks on everyone, because he's trying to get out of a deal he made! You didn't see a leprechaun, fatass! If you could prove it, I had to suck your balls, but if you couldn't, you had to pay me ten dollars! Pay up! Dad, where do leprechauns come from? So... why would one come to America to warn us about a terrorist attack? I thought I did.   Get out of here, Cartman, we're eating dinner! I'm not doing it, fatass! Just get ''out'' of here! I don't care if I signed an agreement! That if he could prove leprechauns exist, I would suck his balls. Hey dudes.  How was what? I didn't suck his balls, all right?! And I'm not going to! Uch, I didn't think there would actually be a leprechaun! And I still don't! Why would a leprechaun be warning us of a terrorist attack?! There's another explanation for all this. All right I've had enough! Leprechauns are imaginary! Dude.  '''Are you gonna take us somewhere or not?!'''  Dude!  A-ah! A-a-ah! Wha? Where...? Oh. Oh dude. Oh, it was just a dream. It was all just a crazy dream. Huh, oh my God.  Dude, did you finish your math homework? I kind of lost track of time last night.  ...And then it got attacked by terrorists? Dude! I had the same dream! We jumped on a dragon's back and, and Butters got left behind! What did they say??  ...Dude... I... Uh... W-uh... but... Come o- come on! Really? I mean, aren't there more important things going on right now? Let's just get this over with! God damnit! Who are you?
