That's right! Tell me the truth! Now!  Ahaaa! Nice work, Conner. Surprise to see me, asshole?! Close the door! Them who?! Then start explaining it to me! No nooo no no no! He's not doing anything except explaining who my father is! It's all that matters! I guarantee you people care way more about who my father is! Who you calling stupid, Jew? Gingers? No! Hello? What the hell is this? Where am I? Shut up, Conner! How about I shove this flashlight in your mouth? Hello? I'm here, whoever you are.  Daddy?  Chili Con Carnival? ...Wait a minute. ...No it can't be. Scott Tenorman. Eeewww. What do you know?! Mom? Protect who?? My dad was a Denver Bronco? No- nooo. No! Noooo! Tough to hear? My dad was Scott Tenorman's dad. Don't you guys realize what that means? My dad was a ginger! I mean, obviously, I take after my mom, but I have the ginger gene inside of me! What? Cheer up? I'm half ginger! Hey, you're right. That ''does'' make me pretty cool. Really, Mitch? Ya, you've gotta go? Take it easy, Conner.
