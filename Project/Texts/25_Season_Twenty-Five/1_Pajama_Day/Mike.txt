Hey guys– sorry I'm a little late. Got a flat tire on the interstate.  What's the latest news? Well, what do you mean? Oh– yeah– I-I didn't really wanna wear pajamas. Yeah, I just didn't want to with the rain and slush outside. It just... didn't make any sense to wear pajamas. Well you can't force me to wear pajamas! What is this, Nazi Germany? Good, if it's not a big deal, then I'll choose not to wear pajamas.
