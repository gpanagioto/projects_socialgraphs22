Dad, what are you doing? Aw crap.  Can I have a Pop Tart? Dad, you know Mom doesn't want you watching food channels. You guys have no idea how much it sucks! My dad's obsessed! Every day it's Bobby Flay this, Gordon Ramsey that. This morning he was pretending to read Playboy, but he actually had a Bon Appetit magazine hidden inside it! Awww what?! No, dad! No! Dad, you're a geologist! What about your real job?! Dad, no! I'm gonna tell Mom. Go back to your other job right now! Mom? Mom! You've gotta do something! Dad's trying to be our new school chef. Well you've gotta tell him to stop, Mom! Mom, Dad's food sucks and kids at school are starting to get pissed at me! Dad, what are you doing? Dad! You aren't ever going to be a celebrity chef! No Dad, that's enough! You need to be focusing on getting Mom back! He's not going to listen to us! We already tried! That's stupid, Cartman. You guys, my dad is retarded, but not that retarded. ...Uh yeah Dad, he'd like to talk to you. Alright Dad, Gordon Ramsay said you suck. It's time to give up. Dad! You aren't ever going to become a celebrity chef, Dad! Give up on your dream!  Hey no, no. All you people get out of here.
