O Great Wizard of Gregendath. What quest do you ask of this Ranger and Paladin? You're sending us on... a quest? You ask of us to take the one video to the House of Butters?  Very well, we shall embark on this quest immediately, father! Come, warriors! How shall we journey to the house of Butters? Through the mines of Endor or over the mountains of Grog? Good job, wizard. My father has asked that we bring you this copy of ''Lord of the Rings''. The one tape was returned and South Park was again at peace.  We gave it to the parents of Butters as commanded by you. Woww. We have come to reclaim the one tape!   Yeah, and mine parents were acting strange about it, too. Nothing.  Hey, kid! Give it back! We're on a quest to return it to my parents! There's ''four'' of us! Kenny's soul is still trapped in Cartman's body! Oh crap, dude! Ogh.  Yeah. Butters, my parents, now the sixth graders. We must speak with the High Elf of Paragon. Yes, but this is not a--  But if we watch it, we could fall under its spell, too.  Uh, wellâ€”Wait, what'd you see? What do we do with it? I will take it!  I will walk to the video store. No, no, there's seven of us. Kenny's soul is still trapped in Cartman's body, remember? True. Someone or something doesn't want this video returned to the video store. Perhaps the Great Ringworm of Bailey is about. Jimmy didn't stop them! Just get across the river! They're coming!  Man, we should have never crossed that stupid river. This is great! We're in the middle of nowhere and nobody knows what direction the video store is in! Where?! Tell us how to get to the video store, Butters, or else we're gonna kick your ass! Closed?  Quick, Kyle, drop the movie in! They're coming! Uh-oh. Oh hey guys, uh... We were just about to come home. We had to return the video. ...Wow.
