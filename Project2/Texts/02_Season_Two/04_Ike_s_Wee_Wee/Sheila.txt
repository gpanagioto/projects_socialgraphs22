Just a little higher. Oh, hi, ''bubele''. I'm glad you're here; you can help decorate for the party. To celebrate your little brother's  passage into life. It's Jewish tradition, ''bubbe''. Oy, what is the matter with them? ''Bubbe'', where have you been? Dinner's been ready for five minutes. How ''is'' my little jellybean? Okay, but first let Mommy give you a kiss. Aaaaargh! Omigod, make him stop! ''My baby!'' Oh, God, the horror!  Ooooohhhhhhooh-ho! Oooh, my baby! Bubbeleh mine! Waagghh!! My baby!!  Oh, he's dead, he's ''dead!'' My little <i>bubbeleh's</i> dead! Well, ''bubbe'', there's something you have to know. Ike wasn't really your brother, he was adopted. What are you talking about? What-what-whaaat?! Now, where did you leave him, young man? Gerald! Do something about your smart-ass son! If we don't find him, so help me, you're gonna be grounded for a month! Ike, love? Excuse me, we're looking for a two-year-old Canadian boy.  Come on! Ike! But first, apologize to your brother! Hello, Tom. Hello, Patty. Thanks for coming to Ike's bris. Look Ike, It's Uncle Murray! He's been sent to his room for being a bastard. He's decided that Ike isn't his brother, since he's adopted. Hello. Do I know you? Ohhh, thanks. Hello, Dr. Schwartz! Thank you so much for coming all this way to perform Ike's bris. Right over here.  Kyle, what are you talking about?
