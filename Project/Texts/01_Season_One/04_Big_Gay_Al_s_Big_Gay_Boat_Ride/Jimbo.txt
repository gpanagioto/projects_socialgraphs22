Hey, how's practice coming there, Chef? I don't have to remind you just how important this game is to us South Park alumni. That's as far as most of us got. You think we have a shot at beating the spread against Middle Park this year? Middle Park by 70 points. Nonsense! Not with my nephew at quarterback.  Right Stanley? Atta boy! Come on Ned, we gotta get our asses to the bookie! I want $500 on the South Park Cows. No siree. I'm telling you, I got the line. My nephew Stan is the best quarterback the school has ever seen. I guarantee they'll beat the spread. Whoa, whoa. Don't get too carried away now uh... Hehe, yeah. Don't- don't worry yourself. Not ''that'' sure. I think we better come up with a backup plan. Uhh, let's see here. Hey, bookie! Wha- what's the halftime show gonna be? 'Loving You'? That's perfect! Come on Ned, Middle Park's gonna get a Halftime show they'll never forget. What we wanna do here, Carl, is put a trigger on that bomb that makes it go off at a specific moment during halftime. Well, John Stamos' older brother is all set to sing 'Loving You' during halftime. We want that bomb to go off when he hits that high F. You know, <poem><i>Loving you is easy 'cause you're beautiful doo-nn-doo-nn-doo-doo... Aaaaah.</i></poem> No, dammit! The ''aaaaah''! ''Aaaaahh''! Great. You got it. ''Aaaaahh''!  Come on Ned, and keep quiet. Hello there, Enrique. Well Ned, we always kidnap Middle Park's mascot. But this year, we're gonna booby-trap it instead. And when John Stamos' older brother hits that high F in "Loving You", BOOM! No more Middle Park players! God damn, I love football! Ned, look! They've got Enrique on their sidelines, and it looks like that bomb's still attached. Hell's bells. Don't y'all worry, you just wait till halftime, heheh. What the hell?! He didn't sing the high F! Ned... We're gonna to get our asses kicked. Yeah! Yohooooh! Give 'em hell, Stanley! Jesus? Now I haven't asked you for much, but all we need is one little score. Please? Please, Jesus? Yeah! Wooo! Yeah! Woohoo! What?! No!
