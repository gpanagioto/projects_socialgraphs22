 Aw Jesus, not again. Yes! It's over! It's over! We can start having fun again!  We did it! We did it! ... What? No... NOOO!! Look, you guys, maybe it's not all that bad. I know, but listen: the finals are all sudden-death elimination, right? That means as soon as we lose one game, our season is over. I know we can lose if we try. Okay, so then we'll just tell the other team quietly that we're gonna let them win, and then we'll act like we're trying. Our parents will never know. Hundred bucks, no big whoop. Uhh, hay guys, look, we don't wanna win, so uh,  here's a list of all the pitches I'm gonna throw, in order. Look! We're gonna be the losers tonight, all right?! Damnit! No!  Aw spit!  Oh no. No, no, no! Dad? Dad, we need to talk.  I don't suppose you guys want to win this game. Gay. Hey yeah. We need to find the very worst kid athlete in the whole world. Somebody who can't possibly win. Yeah, with him on our team, we don't stand a chance. Wow, he IS great at sucking. Dude, we had it all wrong. While we spent all our time trying to make our team suck, these guys practiced and got really good at sucking.    Come on, Dad! Get up! Dad!
