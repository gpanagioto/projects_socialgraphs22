Sheila, let me handle this. Having imaginary friends is fine, Kyle, but this simply will not do! Now, I want you to repeat after me: 'There is no such thing as Mr. Hankey'. Say it! Again! Now, you go brush your teeth and march into bed! You won't be opening your Channukah present tonight! What did you say?! Kyle, what are you doing in there? Open this door! KYLE! Now, you get to sleep, and think about how your poor mother has to clean that bathroom up! It wasn't ''our'' idea to take out Santa Claus! Get him in the ribs! 
Your mother's made gahekgafuga. Meaning we're going to circumcise him.  Normally, we do it right after the baby is born, but we had to do it later for Ike because he's a--  Oh, now what's gotten into him? Stan, will you go talk to him? AAAGGGHH!!! Get out of here, you mutt! Let him go! There, there, Shei-hla. There's nothing we can do. He was not really a Broflovski, he was Canadian. But we loved him all the same.  Uhhh... Mind your... mother, smart-ass. Kyle, just because Ike is adopted doesn't make him any less your brother. Now you march to your room, and you think about what you've done! Apologize to him! 
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Sheila, could you pass me the dead fetus? I mean, gravy. Ow! Oh, I don't know. I think our boys might just have the dead fetus to win-- Heart! 
Please come home, Kyle. <poem><i>You left home lookin' for somethin' new.</i></poem> <poem><i>But all you need is right here waitin' for you</i></poem> 
Who? Stuart? Yeah, yeah, I guess we were. Well, because Kenny's family doesn't have as much money as we do. Ha ha ha ha ha! Ooh-ho boy, have ''you'' got a lot to learn! Sit down, son. You see, Kyle, we humans work as a society, and in order for a society to thrive, we need gods, and clods. Yes. You see, I spent a lot of time going to law school, and I was able to go because I have a slightly higher intellect than others. But I still need people to pump my gas, and make my French fries, and fix my laundry machine when it breaks down. ''That's'' right. So Kenny's family is happy just the way they are, and we're all a functioning part of America. Oh, yeah, love it! I haven't done it for a while, though. I had to go out and buy a few things, you know a-. A rod and a reel and an uh, uuh... Yeah, tackle box.  Man, smell that mountain air. What a great Saturday morning; aren't weekends just the best? Right. Right-right. Huh? Oh, uh, no thanks, I brought my own. Microbrew sampler from Aspen. Has six different beers from local breweries. Sahay, remember that time we built the fort in your mom's back yard? Hahah. Whatever happened to that old hunk o' junk? Haha-- Oh, right. Well, I'm sure you'll find another job soon. Something'll come along. Now, now-I, I wasn't lucky. Hey! I worked my ''ass'' off to get to where I am today!  I wanted to be somebody! You're just jealous. You're a bitter old drunk, just like your father! Ow!!  Ow! You son of a bitch! Ow! Ow!  Huuuh! That son of a bitch ripped my parka! I just don't get it. Why would he invite me fishing and then turn into a complete bastard? What? Now why the hell would you ''knowingly'' deceive me like that? Just like you deceived our son into going to Kenny's; and that didn't work either! What?! Oh, God, what have I done? Are you doing okay? And, uh Stuart, I think I owe you an apology. I realize that I shouldn't be so cold towards people that are less fortunate than me. 
Now, just let me do all the talking, Chef. We’re gonna bring these bastards down. I am, Your Honor. Gerald Broflovski. Uh-oh. Chef, that's Johnnie Cochran. He's the guy who knocked O.J. off. ...And so, in summation, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you've heard the version of my client's song recorded over twenty years ago. You've heard the exact same song produced by those cheats in the past month. I'd say it's pretty much an open-and-shut case. Make the right decision. Thank you.  We've got 'em. Dammit..! He’s using the Chewbacca defense. Whoops. How was it, honey? 
I'm sorry, honey. What?! Kidding? Well, that's not funny! That hurt my feelings! Why?!  Huh? Yes. Why? Kyle, where's your mother? Well, I have something to give to her!  Don't worry, Kyle. Everything's gonna be okay between me and your mom. 
We're rooting for the ''Broncos'' here, Jakov!  Here- here you go. And and don't go to the store down the block. The one four miles away in Fairplay has ''better'' pretzels. 
 Sorry I'm late. Oh! Hi, Kyle.  As you can see, Your Honor, my client is too upset to continue. All right, we did it! Hm.  You know, Eric, I've been thinking, uh... Uh, you know, the people ''really'' responsible for your harassment is the public schools.  Perhaps we should sue them next. Well, because they're the ones that let this harassment go on. And, they have a lot more money. I think we could get a lot more out of this than half of Stan's belongings. Mr. Garrison, do you know the definition of sexual harassment? Did you, or did you not, hear my client being called an ass-sucker? And you did nothing. Principal Victoria, were you aware that my client was being harassed at your school? Oh! So you ''admit'' that harassment goes on! You don't know?! You're the principal!  So it DOES go on!!! Principal Victoria, was Eric Cartman called an ass-sucker? Yes or no? Last, I'd like to bring up my expert witness: Sexual Harassment Panda. Expert witness, did South Park Elementary allow sexual harassment to go on? And who's to blame? There! You have it! Straight from the horse's mouth! Pan-Panda's mouth. All right! We did it, Eric! That goes in the master bedroom.  Well, Kyle. What do you think of your new house? Yes, it ''is'' big, isn't it? It is very big. Well Kyle, schools have lots of money. You see, we all pay taxes, and part of that tax money goes to public schools, and it's from ''that'' money that we got our 1.3 million. No. It's a very fragile system that nature has designed. All things flow into each other. Sort of, yeah.  close the lid on sexual harassment in schools! So call me, Kyle's dad. Because it's not about money, it's about... wait, what am I saying? Call me!  ''Wow'', I'm good!  Don't answer that!  Incriminate.  Well? What do you think, Kyle? Well, this one is ''bigger''!  Kyle, let me explain something to you. You see, Kyle, we live in a liberal, democratic society. And Democrats make sexual harassment laws. These laws tell us what we can and can't say in the workplace. And what we can and can't ''do'' in the workplace. No, because we don't call it fascism. Do you understand?  Just look at how big this house is, Kyle. Just look at it. Thank you, Your Honor. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, Everyone has committed a crime here, and Everyone must pay for that crime. My client, Everyone, has been hurt by this crime and must be compensated. Your honor, I'd like to make my closing arguments.  No! Don't you see? Th-the panda's right. Boy, what a great message he has! When you sue people, you just end up causing a lot of problems for society. Uhwell, I've really learned something today. All I could see was the millions of dollars coming to me and I didn't care about where the money came from. Well, I'm no longer doing sexual harassment lawsuits in schools! They're too vague and too easily corruptible. Thank you, Sexual Harassment Panda! Yeah, well, whatever, sooo let's... not... sue anyone again. Okay, come on, guys. Let's go get some ice cream! 
Wow, neat! Yeah. Well, screw you guys!  Yeah, I know what you mean. Well, that's what being young is all about. Once you have a family and a career, your experimenting days are over. But tonight is the exception; that's why I'm gonna smoke this cigar.  What haven't you tried that you've always wanted to try? Yeah! ...Was that your leg? Yeah. She sure does. I wouldn't mind takin' that home. I wish. That's the one thing I've always thought of experimenting with. A threesome. Huh, well, two girls, of course! I mean ...with another guy, you know, that'd be...  You haven't? Well, I never really wanted to experiment with anything too crazy. You know... maybe just... I don't know... masturbate in front of another guy. NO, no, uh I don't think so. Sure is.   So uh. Well. That was certainly... interesting. Uh, you don't regret doing it now, do you? Thuh that's right. It's just harmless experimenting. Hey.  Nothing changes between us, right? I mean, we're still friends.  Can I come with you?  Randy, you're making me feel unimportant. Talk. Talk, damn you. So, so now we can't be friends? We said we'd never tell anybody? Oh, uh I didn't realize that.  Well, uh uh a few people, yeah. You didn't say ''not'' to tell anyone. Listen to you. You're yelling at me; you've never yelled at me before. Hey, Randy, what's up? Huh? Wulluh uh I just felt like talkin' to you. You're having regrets, aren't you? Hey. Talk to me. I thought we agreed what happened in the hot tub wouldn't change our relationship. Hey, Mr. Withdrawn, ''you'' might not need to talk about it, but ''I'' sure do. Having a good time? I'm not gonna let you change on me, Randy. Just because we shared an intimate moment in the hot tub, I won't let it change our friend-  Honey? Everybody doesn't know. And why are you so ashamed of me? I just want to know it meant something to you. So we're friends again? 
I don't know. Come on, Kyle! You're gonna be late for Jew Scouts! You see boys, Jew Scouts is a special group that borrows a little bit from all different Jewish denominations. From the Orthodox Jews, from the Hasidic Jews, from the Northern Italy Cave Jews... But you have to believe the basic tenets of Judaism to be a Scout. Oh, all right. Just don't let any of the elders know that he isn't Jewish, okay?  Ike, your brother Kyle was in Squirts, and so was I. You have to go so someday you can be a big brave Jew Scout. Tell Ike how much fun Squirts is, Kyle. Yeah, lie. Hey, it's a bear!  Yeah.  Actually, we saw a bear a few miles back. We'll be back to pick you up after the meteor shower party, boys. 
I hate to say it, but I think Priest Maxi was right. This is what we get for celebrating Halloween and allowing that band KoRn to come play. 
Yeah, I guess so. Well, Kyle, that's not a reason to buy something. You see, son, fads come and go. And this "Chin-po-ko-mon" is obviously nothing more than a fad. You don't have to be a part of it. In fact, you can make an even stronger statement by saying to your peers, "I'm not going to be a part of this fad, because I'm an individual." Do you understand? Hm... Good point; here's $10.  Wait, here's 20. Get one for your brother, too.  Oh God, is there nothing we can do? 
You bet money on my son to win?! Hey, my son is just discovering love. Maybe your daughter is, too. They-uh, they need to know about that stuff. Yeah. See ya.  The flagpole! That's great!  
He can't do that! Uh, what are they doing? You're dreaming! This is a reenactment, Kyle. My name is Pvt. John Fugasol, and I have to do what my general tells me! More schnapps!  Where am I? Me neither. What's "grab ass?" Hey, come on. We should take a tour of the Smithsonian before we head back. 
Hello, everybody. Say, can I join in? <poem><i>Courtney Cox,</i></poem> <poem><i>I love you.</i></poem> <poem><i>You're so hot</i></poem> <poem><i>on that show.</i></poem> <poem><i>Courtney Cox,</i></poem> <poem><i>I love you.</i></poem> <poem><i>You're so hot</i></poem> <poem><i>on that show.</i></poem> <poem><i>Courtney Cox,</i></poem> <poem><i>I-</i></poem> huh?   ...Oh, sorry. <poem><i>Courtney Cox,</i></poem> <poem><i>I love you.</i></poem> <poem><i>You're so hot</i></poem> <poem><i>on that show.</i></poem> <poem><i>Courtney Cox,</i></poem> <poem><i>I love you.</i></poem> <poem><i>You're so hot</i></poem> <poem><i>on that show.</i></poem> 
 One question? 
 What? Oh. Kyle, let's have a little talk.  No. Kyle, she's just make-believe. Like Peter Pan. Kyle... Well, they were probably real. Probably not. Look, Kyle, adults make up those things because they're fun for children. 
It sure did. It's so wonderful to be on the same wavelength as our kids. 
Oh my God!  
 Hey, boys, how's the research coming? Oh, uuhh. I don't know.  Oh, those weren't mints, those were antacid tablets. 
Very good, Ike. That's two John Steinbeck books in one day. Kyle, it's all about being a good person now! You see, Christians use hell as a way to scare people into believing what they believe. But to believe in something just because you're afraid of the consequences if you ''don't'' believe in something is no reason to believe in something. Understand? 
 
Oh yeah, I got a great angle here. Good idea. 
That's what being young is all about. 
The answer is no, Kyle! A communist country run by a dictator named Fidel Castro. Kyle, your mother and I don't want you going to the Raging Pussies concert! We gave you a chore that we thought was impossible. You weren't supposed to actually do it. Kyle, perhaps we handled this wrong, buh- but you need to understand that we don't want- Because we're your parents! Hello, honey, how has prison been for you? Eh, neither did we. Oh, that's disgusting!!! Now, now stop this!! I don't have any urges! Kyle, we're so sorry for the horrible sexual abuse over the years. But we're all better now. Hup, we did. We've come to terms with it through therapy and learned to admit it. 
 Uh huh. 
Oh, look, Kyle. Your little friend Stan is here to see you. Kyle, y-you-you just don't understand. It's-- Hello, Kyle. How's the hemorrhoid today? Oh, I think you'll see differently after hearing this. Sit down, Kyle.  He was the most upright and honorable of men, and every day he praised God.  But Satan said, "Oh yeah? He only praises you because you gave him so much. If you didn't give him those things, he would curse your name." And so, God had a bunch of barbarians come in and slaughter Job's oxen and donkeys, and murder all his workers.  And then, as Job's sons and daughters were eating, God sent a mighty wind to collapse the house and crush and kill them all.  So then, Job got painful sores all over his body.  God said to Satan, "See? I told you. Job still praises me."  Oh. Uhhh, I don't know. Isn't he responding at all, doctor? 
But, what if you're not ready at 17? 
Hey! W-what are you saying? What "types"? They're scared to death! They were so scared, I'm sure they'll never be back! 
...He might, Kyle. 
Oh we're so sorry, Jared. 
A-Aspen? Uuuh, we, we can't really afford that. I-I'm sorry, but none of us can really afford to own our own vacation condo. Well your ad said we only had to attend a thirty-minute meeting. Aha.  Wow, filet mignon' and lobster! Yeah. Can we go now, please? Finally, we get to go skiing! Yeah, I guess these passes the time-share salesman gave us ''will'' come in handy. Yeah, we may not have gotten to ski earlier, but with this lift we'll get more runs in than anybody. How many times do we have to tell you this? We don't want to buy shares in a condo! Pressure us?! You kept us all day yesterday and then had a chair lift bring us back! My God, can you believe those people?! The police work for time-share, too?  
Yes Kyle, but you still defied your parents. And you need to learn that terrorism is never the answer. 
Kyle, Ike says you kicked him off the TV. You know your brother watches MacNeil/Lehrer Report every night at ten! It doesn't matter! Ten to eleven is Ike's time to watch MacNeil/Lehrer. 
 Uh, well, we need to find a way to close our town off from unwanted strangers! We just think that you're the best person to put up a wall. We're sure you've got it in your blood.   Look out for your brother, Kyle. You're the man now. 
A ladder tuh... Oh... oh God.  Yeah... Ih it's time we told the boys the truth, that they aren't really going to get to heaven.  But it's time for you to get back to school and on with your lives. Kyle, that's not the issue right now. Kids! 
All right, calm down. Now, just how bad of a porno tape are we talking here? I mean, was it like ''Crotch Capers 3''? I-it is the single most vile, twisted, dark piece of porn ever made.   I, uh, I-I-I read about it in ''People''. Steve, uh, we heard that a bunch of the kids were over here a little while ago. It was ''Backdoor Sluts 9''. Uh, Tolkien, this is very important: do you know where the boys went with the naughty tape? Well, we'll find them. A-and then we'll try to put what they saw into context. Stinger? Now, on to double penetration, boys. You see, sometimes when a woman has sex with more than one man, each man makes love to a different orifice. Okay, boys. Do you have any questions?  
I really enjoyed the imagery in the last chapter of this month's book. So full of metaphor. Yeah, dirty lungs! That's what our boys were talking about? We've gotta get our boys back!  
That brave, brave man. 
Aaah, can we cross the line to take our kids to school? There was no war months ago! Yeah?! See you Saturday, makizzer shanna sharilla shaz biuznatch gazizzah! Yeah! We could have the boys do their presentation as part of our peace rally on Saturday! Disgraceful! Stan and Kyle, it's up to you to show all those war-mongerers that the Founding Fathers agree with us! And if it weren't for ''you'' people flexing your arms, America could easily get taken over by terrorists or... or China. 
All right, we're gonna hit the tables. Why don't you kids run along to the comedy club?  Oh yeah! blackjack table! Relax, sweetie  I know how to count cards. All right, time to show these people how to gamble!  Ohh, not so good. Yeah. I'm down twenty-six thousand. I forgot to tell you, ah I have a gambling problem. Sshhhh! I have to win it back before Sheila finds out! The casino gave me credit! I put the house up as collateral! But I still have this ten-dollar chip.  Wha- what's in the cup?  Oh God. Oh Jesus.  Oh, shove the song of the sparrow up your ass! How am I going to tell my family?    What, What did you say?  No, no, no, if you wanna leave South Park, fine! Tomorrow we're leaving! Oh, you heard him, Sheila! Kyle wants to leave! Our nice old house doesn't interest Kyle anymore! Well I'm calling a moving company right now!  Yeah! But wait.  Let it ride!! 
Yeah. I think it's great that gays are finally being so accepted.   Kyle! What's happened to you?? Oh my God! Come on, Sheila!  Hi Sharon. Uh, we need to talk to you about the boys. Oh, is the game on or something?  Oh no! Y-you guys all turned gay too??  What's that?  Kyle! You look terrible!  Oh, really?! Well, don't you worry, Kyle. We can cover that black eye up with some cream base, and the coat and pants we'll bleach with an acid wash for a fun vintage look. Hurry, you guys! The mall closes in seven hours! 
Three hundred dollars?? What in the world for?? Sorry Kyle, we gave you your allowance already. It wasn't your life yesterday.  The answer is no, Kyle.  Kyle, what did you do?! Thanks for releasing them to us, detective. Sorry for all the trouble they caused. 
We've gotta get out of here! They, they're... they're playing street hockey! Randy, what is this? 
Haven't you boys heard anything about how harmful smoking is to you and those around you? 
We thank God for our blessings this Chanukah. Our little family is so loving, and perfect, and nothing will ever tear us apart.  Yes? Yes, I can tell. I'm not sure. What? Look, you gave Ike up. You can't just change your mind. Look, Ike is ''our'' son now! Harder for Peter?! Now you two just blow in here and say you're gonna haul him back to Canada, and ''we're being hard on Peter?!'' Well you bet your ass it'll come to that! There's nothing I ''can'' do. Good-bye, Ike. You...  Oh! Kyle, appealing to the Prime Minister of Canada would take... time and money we don't have. 
This is the worst thing that's happened in this town!  The ''worst thing''! 
Kyle, what on earth has gotten into you?! 
So, Mr. Jefferson, did I hear you say you moved here from Kentucky? Hey, you know Kobe Bryant was up in Eagle today. Oh come on, Mr. Jefferson, you're not one of those who think that the police go around framing rich black people just because they're jealous? 
Yeah. That guy probably thinks he can get us to go away by being so goofy!  Well where else was I gonna get a napkin dispenser at nine thirty at night? Jesus! Look at us! We all don't like the Wall-Mart, but we can't stop coming here. We can't destroy it, son. We have to learn to live with it. How did you do it, Kyle? Yeah! Let's all go shop at Jim's Drugs down the street!  
 What? Th'um, nuh-nothing. I- I'll explain it to you when you're a little older. Your teacher had a sex change?? Oh my God!  That does it! I'm taking you boys OUT OF THAT SCHOOL!  He's a teacher! How are we supposed to explain this to our children?! Oh, just great! You see, Sheila?! This is what your transgender progressive thinking gets you! Now your son wants to be transracial! KYLE, YOU'D BETTER STOP BEING ANTI-SEMITIC RIGHT NOW, MISTER!!  Oh, that does it!  Who the hell do you think you are?! What kind of nutjob would agree to surgically alter my son into a tall African-American?! Huh that's right! And I also happen to be a lawyer! And I'm gonna have you sued for malpractice, and your clinic shut down!! What th- Look, they're- They're dolphins! Why? A b--uh I love dolphins, Ever since I was a child I dreamt of... Huh b-b-b- But that has hardly any bearing on what I'm hear to- ...What?  ...No.  No, no, it's crazy. That doctor is a miracle worker, Sheila. Iiii'm the happiest I've ever been.   I used to think I was crazy. But Dr, Biber told me that there are a lot of other people out there who are transspecies. All I did is change my appearance to look the way I felt...   Come on, Kyle, we should get going! Alright Kyle!  Excuse me, where do you have special seating for dolphins? Eh excuse me, where, where is the bathroom for dolphins? Well where the hell am I supposed to go to the bathroom? I I need a large tank with salt water. Damnit you people have to make special arrangements for transspecies people like me! I may be a dolphin, but I'm also a lawyer! What? Why?? Oh my God!   Mrs. Garrison, grab Kyle! Stop the game!  So, does this mean I'm not really a dolphin? 
 We'll wish we spent the money when we have a lawsuit on our hands. 
Congratulations, boys! You're goin' on to the post-season. Woohoo! Boy, that was great, wasn't it?! How much was bail this time?  Yeah, those dads get REALLY drunk and obnoxious. We're so proud of you kids! Geez I really wish this guy would shut up. 
Shh, shh! We've got the television working!  And... the rest of the country? Randy! We've looked everywhere! Kyle's missing too! I'm going with you. You can't do this alone! Stephen!  Stephen, you have to keep moving! Oh Jesus...  I feel warm too! Maybe we should... strip these jackets off, and warm our bodies next to each other! 
Good-bye! Wow! It seems like you had a great time with the Super Adventure Club, Chef. They sound like interesting people. 
Hey there, Richard! Yeah. It's a hybrid. I just... I just couldn't sit back and-  be a part of destroying the earth anymore. Oho...  You know, the emissions from a vehicle like yours causes irreparable damage to the ozone. I drive a hybrid; it's much better for the environment.  Thanks. Oh yes. You've got one too, I see.  Thanks. Hold on, boys. We still have to go to the hardware store, and hand out awareness citations to SUV cars in the parking lot. Okay, there's another one.  "Ticket for driving a gas-guzzler" Look, there's a Jeep over there! Go write them a ticket, Kyle! NOW, KYLE!  Oh! Sorry Randy. Looks like you got a ticket. Yeah. I'm just, you know, trying to make people more ''aware'' ya' know, it's a- Well, Randy, calm down. It's not a real ticket. Jimbo, your truck probably gets less than ten miles to the gallon. Look, I'm just trying to make the people of South Park aware of a very serious problem. Oh! I'm sorry! I didn't think it was "high and mighty" to  care about the earth! Well, I really don't see how  that has anything to do with the- All right, that does it! Come on, Kyle, I don't want you hanging around with these ignorant idiots!  Yeah. Yeah, I think it's best we just do it right away.  Yes, it certainly is. Well, I totally agree, Kyle. Yes. A lot of people in town just aren't ready to drive hybrid cars. And that's why,  ...we've decided to MOVE! We need to be where everyone is motivated and progressive like us! Start getting your things packed, boys! The Broflovksi family is moving to San Francisco!  I'm sorry, Stan, but unfortunately you live in a small-minded town filled with ignorant boobs.   Well? What do you think, huh?  Yeah. Now THIS, is a house.  Yes that's right. We're the Broflovskis. Yeah. That's right. Wow, so, everyone here drives a hybrid, huh? Yeah. We sure are. Yeah, well, you know my son is just  a little bit more clever than some. Hey there. Alan, right? Right right, w-would, would you like red or white wine? Oh. Sure.  Everything okay in here, Kyle? So much better here with the intellectuals, isn't it, boys?  Mmmm.  We don't know. We were all passed out and... next thing we know we just woke up on a bus heading here. And let's make sure nobody gets a stupid hybrid, right?  I don't think I can do it either. Come on, everybody! Let's go buy wasteful gas guzzlers!  
 Which cartoon is it? What cartoon'll be so insensitive as to have Mohammad as a character?  It's okay... it's dead. Kyle! Kyle, wake up!  We have to go! The terrorists are attacking! This isn't a joke, Kyle! Bombs have already gone off in six cities!  He was just here! Ike! Yeah. The sand thing sounds a lot simpler.  
Like it. Okay, that'll be great. Let's also make sure we have enough chairs in the community center for everyone to attend.  That's it. I'm gonna make a break for it. If I can make it through them, maybe I can catch the bus to Fairplay. I have to try.  Ahh. Ahhhahhahahahh. Don't have any change... Don't have any change... Damn it! All right, you want change? Here.  Oh wait. Wait, now I don't have any change left for the bus. Hold on. Can I just get back some of that change, please? Can I have just a little change for the bus, please? I need a little... anybody have some change? Change? Got any change?   Hello?  I I'm sorry, I just really need some change for the bus? Stop it! I really do need change!  Hello? Do you have any change? What? You do? Cha-a-ange? 
Well Kyle? 
Hey Randy.  Oh no, seriously, this crap was a monster!  I doubt it.  Jesus... It's... other-worldly.  Oh yes there is! You could do it again! Think about it: you weren't even ''trying'' to take the biggest crap last time. Imagine if you actually ''worked'' at it! That's what we're here for.  I talked to the EFSM and they say Randy has to take the crap ''in Zurich''. They say that Bono is demanding it and that their hands are tied. 
 From Ireland. Doing what? Ah hey now Kyle, if you made a deal with somebody, you have to stick by it. What was the agreement? 
But he has his mother's nose. 
It's okay, Kyle. Just... be a good boy. 
Killing our kids?  Oh my God! Sheila! Come look at this! We have to protect our children from this, Sheila. Twenty percent of American students aged six to twelve say they have tried cheesing at least once. Kids also refer to it as "the cheese game", or "vitamin cheese", or "Mary Jane piss in your face fun time". Cheesing is spreading fast. I have written up a bill that would make having a cat illegal in the city of South Park. With my super lawyer powers, we can rid our town of cats, so that our kids can never get high again! Kyle! Kyle, can we talk to you for a minute, please? Kyle, have you been getting high?! Then why did your mother find this  in your dresser drawer?! How long have you been on the cheese?! Get up to your room right now until your mother and I figure out how to deal with this! Now, Kyle! First thing is we've gotta dispose of this! I'd better just... take it down to the basement for now, m-make sure Kyle can't find it.   I couldn't stay away. Curse your rockin' tits! Hey everybody. Good to see you again.  Huh... how come? What?  Get out of here, kid! You're too young for this stuff! She's mine, you little asshole! I would like to address a personal matter: I have let myself down. And I would first like to apologize to my lovely wife. And to the people of South Park.  We have to learn that cheesing just isn't worth it. Sure, you get to fight in the Breastriary, and swim in the Fountains of Varnov with the Itty Titty Fairies of Mammary Mountain. And then you fight the Boob Goblin in the Gazongas Cave, and then the girl may thank you for it. But she. Isn't. Real. Problem is, the more you go into that world, the more you need to go. Until you start blowing off all the real people who care about you.  Cats aren't the problem. We made cats illegal and and then I cheesed for the first time in ten years. And kids are always gonna find a new way to get high. Like sniffing glue or licking toads, or fermenting feces or huffing paint. You can also look at- The point is, I was wrong. Its time to legalize cats!  
Randy. What happened? Come in. You can use our Internet until you figure out what to do. No.  No, our Internet can't be broken. Ah, I've gotta get an attachment Larry sent me last night. But it has to work! Maybe if I do a little- Everyone get your stuff; we can take my car. Everyone in the car. We have to beat them there.  Get out of the way, Peterson!  How can there be no Internet anywhere? What's going on?! We can't! Don't you get it?! There's no Internet to find out why there's no Internet! It could be nationwide. No Internet... anywhere... Randy, where will you go? You don't know if there's any Internet in California.  What is it, Kyle? 
Nobody know anything. It's li-it's like the boys just vanished! All we know is they were seen hanging out with Craig and now they're gone. 
 Yyeeaahh!!!! 
What can we do, Randy? 
How did this happen? 
Take it easy. We'll find him. It's alright, he couldn't have gone far. Let's call the other kids' houses.  
  Ike, get back to bed right now! Uh, not this again.  Ike, we are sick of you talking about ghosts! No buts! Get back to your room right now and don't come out! You got it?!   Hoh, I don't know. I think maybe with all the news of famous people dying this summer, he just freaked himself out. 
You're so right about this place. It's wonderful. 
Well Butters, we think... that this is one of the BEST books we've ever read. Yeah, it's really amazing. 
Stan, a class-action lawsuit means the end of this town. We can't possibly go up against their lawyers! Cruise's lawyers were very specific boys. He's sending a limo for Muhammad to meet him outside of town. But our homes and our lives are at stake. 
 Muff cabbage?  
I wanna educate you kids with some real music.  Whattaya mean it sounds like shit? This doesn't sound like shit. 
 Okay, I'm done. I don't need you wiping my ass for me. I'm a grown man. Yeah, I'm a big boy. I'm a big boy. I took a big boy poop. 
 What's going on down here? 
 Hey Sheila. You feel like having some fun?  How about I put on the uniform? Huh? What do you think? You know you like it. UPS man. I have a ...package from Amazon for you. If you'll just...  Yeah?  Huh?  And what do we tell our kids?! We can't leave them in the dark! What?  What?! You don't even have a wife, Jimbo!  Yes, that's mine. Uhh, Kyle, uh sometimes when people get older they need to play and pretend to keep things interesting. Iiit's just a way I can still be intimate with your mother without relying on silly sexual enhancement drugs.  
Punching trees? You are? 
Yes? That's right.  My son and his friends throw a party for a kid with diabetes. Oh yeah, yeah, the kids were pretty excited. ...Sorry, I don't think I get your- From what I understand, she's the niece of someone's coworker here in town or something. No. Does it really matter? 
Are you guys parked over here? A Handicar? What's that? Wow... Lucky. Come on, honey. It says our Handicar is just pulling up. Stephen, what are you doing? Randy, they're bringin' back Wacky Races Saturday monring! God help them all. Wow. Oh no! Ohh! 
There you are, Kyle. I was gonna see if you and your brother wanted to go down to the bowling alley. It's your day off. You boys really wanna spend it inside in front of the TV? All right.  I swear I'll never understand you kids these days. 
Uhm, hi, I'm Gerald, Kyle Broflovski's father.  Wull, what's this about, Kyle? Wh-wh-what did he say? PC Principal, I, I'm sure Kyle was just referring to Bruce Jenner as a person, and not trying to say anything against- No... Look, maybe we can all just ta- Kyle's already got two weeks of detention. Just 'cause he said something about Caitlyn Jenner.  Well what the hell were you guys talki- 
Mornin' Randy! Yeah. Look at all the new restaurants the Whole Foods has brought in.   I just... told him who I am.  I'm a yelp reviewer. I usually keep it on the down-low so they don't kiss my ass too much. Thanks, uh, did they mention to you that I am a Yelper? Greeeat. Could you have them turn up the lights a little, please?  Sorry honey, this review for Applebee's has turned into a fifty-pager. And then I have a polish on Ruby Tuesday's.  I am, overwhelmed. Sometimes I don't know what I've gotten myself into. But now everyone relies on my Yelp reviews and I... I don't wanna let anyone down. Thanks, but I, I've gotta Yelp a new place in CtPaTown tonight.  God I'm so damned tired. Ha, "fun," she says.  Yes. Well, good for you. Whoa! Hey!   Huh. Oh thanks. This way, everyone!  I can't, honey. I'm now the leader of thousands of people. They all hang on my every word. And I'm going to use my power to finally get what this town really needs.  Don't call me fat, son! I'm doing this because they've- Now here I stand, vulnerable, afraid, and yet willing to do what the people of this- Thank you, Mayor. It's a big responsibility, but I suppose I have to accept. I will do my best to serve this town. 
Oh, hey, Thomas! Hey, we heard about Craig. We think it's just terrific. 
Well the way I heard it was that the girl in the school wasn't even doing anything. Just talking too loud. And someone ends up getting shot.  Mayor, what are you going to do about this? My wife and I can barely eat or shop. Why would kids in our town wanna be a part of that? Jeez, this is so embarrassing. 
We just feel like this is actual news, and instead of clicking on links, we're reading stories. 
Maybe we should have realized that sometimes the counselor needs counseling. 
 You okay, son? Well um, I'll be in my office if you wanna talk.  
Well, you never know, could be someone who just, kind of thinks it's funny to stir the pot and watch everyone freak out.  Uh, you know! Maybe the fact that it's so not funny makes it somehow funny, to kids? Gosh, I-I certainly don't understand it. Ike? Can I talk to you?  Come on, pull up a chair. You know, we had a big parent meeting at the school tonight, and uh, apparently, there's someone trolling the school message boards and, putting... penises in people's mouths. And whoever it was then got a big reaction from it, so he's now putting penises in people's mouths all over the internet. And... he's actually getting pretty famous! Sooo, Annie Jerkin's mother started an online campaign to stop internet trolling with a picture of her and her daughter, and you know what happened? She got a dick in her mouth! Ha-okay, okay, I know, it's just guy humor stuff, you know. We can laugh about about it here, but, it is serious too. Well, love you pal. Get to sleep, it's a school night.  Oh, hey! Yeah, yeah, we talked. It was good. Yeah, well, I'd better go and get some of my work done. Yeah, don't wait up. I'll be a while with these stupid case profiles. Night sweetie.  Hey, I'd like to volunteer to kick you in the vagina! Where do I sign up?! Your daughter has a mustache - what the hell is wrong with your ovaries bitch?! Sorry! My bad! Ha ha! Don't worry! Oh, no please. It's no problem at all! I made the news...  Yes! Hmm...Game on whore. Game on. 
 Nice.  HA!  From the three-point line! Oh! Police!  Yes? Uh... regarding... uh regarding what?  Hoooh. Sure, that's one of my son's friends. Hooo... another one, huh? Kyle!  Kyle, have you seen your friend Eric online? Look, officers, why don't you just go ask him why he quit Twitter? Ike, got a minute?  Oh. Eh hey, can you turn that up?  Oh my God! Oh shit! Oh shit oh my God! Oh God oh no-oohh! Oh God! Oh God! Oh God! Oh God! Oh God! Protocol Zero. No evidence, clear history. E-mails! delete, delete, delete, erase, erase, trash, trash.   Our computer's broke. 	It broke and I had to throw it away. 	No now you just throw it away. I'll get us a new computer tomorrow. Then I can see if we can pull your recipes up from Ike's computer, and that way we- Ike's computer! Shit!  Move move move!  You? Do you know who I am? Do you know who I am, Ike?  Oh God... 
Sure, Kyle. Uh huh. Good. Sorry Kyle, I have to meet someone. Talk to your mother.   I don't know why you are harassing me. I don't even own a computer. Are you with the NSA or Homeland Security? A colleague? Dildo Shwaggins from Pussystores.org?! You're just a troll?!  Oh thank god! !  Why couldn't you just say, "I know who you are. I'm a troll too,"? Why do you have to be so fucking cryptic?! Look, I'm not really a troll, okay? I just started as a Yelp reviewer and got sick of how everyone's stupid comments sounded.  I just like messing with people 'cause it was funny. I got carried away! For what? It's not a way of life! I was just doing it for the LOLs. . .  I'm great! Totally good. Just sitting down and ... doing nothing. Is there a problem with that? Is there a problem with just wanting to sit and just ''be''? Is that illegal now? I'm totally happy. ''I'm happy''. I don't need to do anything to make me happy, fuck.  Ah! Ah ah, ah! No, no! I'm good. Get that away from me. No, sorry! I love it! I'm just swearing off electronics for a little bit.  No, I'm good! I don't need it! Nothing, Sheila. I'm fine.  I'm just trying to make some changes and less electronics is part of it. I'm sorry, Honey. Everything is okay. Promise.  Go! Go away! Go go!    What is this?! I, I don't even know what a member--. I don't even know what memberberries are. Yeah.   No, nothing! Got all caught up with work!  I'm going on a run!  Fuck you!  Yeah! Screw you, Skank! You fat little bitch! Go kill yourself, whore! Yeah, fuck you, bitch! Fuck you!   Oh, sorry, Hun! Sorry! Everything's fine, Kyle. Go back to bed. Nothing is going on! Okay, okay. I'm going to tell you the truth, Sheila. I watch porn on the Internet. I'm sorry. I'll try to stop. Oh yeah! But uh, it's uh, but this is different. Right! It's really embarrassing. It's... porn! It's... uh, piss! Porn! Piss porn!   No!  Oh no, no! It's not like that. No! I, I, I want you to! I just couldn't ask.  Yes? Yep!  So hot, I mean  It wasn't suppose to be like this. I just thought it was funny making people get wild up. It was just stupid-harmless-lock-room humor, till I made that lady kill herself.  Don't call me that here! Why can't you just go away?! No! Don't you get it?! I went "Protocol Zero"! I broke my phone, I delete all my email accounts so that nobody can trace me  ever again!  Can you please call me "Gerald"?!  Fffffuuuuuccckkk! This can't be happening.  Then it's over. I'm dead. I'm not necessarily Skankhunt42. 
 It's Gerald. Alright? Alright, look. How do you troll somebody? No, no, no, it's not about one person. It's about pushing people's buttons so that they'll react in a way that pushes other people's buttons. Look, you don't just troll a woman with cancer to get a reaction from her, it's all about the group of people that are gonna come to her defense. They're gonna be so self-righteous that another group of people will eventually find those people totally annoying. You're just setting them against each other. It's like the fission reaction that sets off the fusion explosion. The Internet does it all, and you just sit back with your glass of wine and laugh. It's not mean if it's hilarious. If we all worked together? Maybe.  Maybe. Okay, come on. Office is upstairs.  Oh, hi honey. Yeah, it went really well. This is uh, my IT guy. Gonna help me get my office computers set back up. Don't worry about us, hon. Lots of work to do. Love you so much!  Ike, no Internet tonight. We need all the bandwidth we can get. Say hi to Dildo Shwaggins. Yeah? Well now you see I have a lot to lose if they find out who I am. 	What? I told you, it's just funny to me. I do it for the lulz. Skankhunt42 standing by. Alright, engaging Twitter... now! Prepare for overreaction on my mark. 3... 2... Mark. Did they pick it up on Yahoo? Oh, shit! Go to, go to Huffington! 	Oh yes! This is CNN front page right now. Oh, Kyle! Ahh, hey, I didn't think you'd be leaving yet. 	Well, did you see what was all over the Internet? Everyone's ripping on LEGOs. Yeah, now the whole world is blowing up with Danish jokes. It's hilarious. Wow, fuck Denmark, huh Kyle? That's gotta be what just about everyone is thinking now. Fuck Denmark.  
  What are you guys doing here?! Wh-what are you talking about "next one"?  Can I talk to you for a second? Why did you bring them here?! That was a one-time deal so nobody would find out who we are! The election?! I don't give a shit about the election! You don't troll to be political! No, I just do it to laugh, like I did when I was a kid! Don't you just remember being a kid and calling someone a fag for no reason?! Right! Like it was just fun, right?! Getting political doesn't do anything for me. I just like remembering when I was a kid. That's it. You need to get those people to go and then you need to go. Ha ha ha. ha. You stupid bitch. God. Fuck you! Nobody cares about your fat, little--  Yes? I told you to stop FaceTiming me while I'm on the computer. It's very distracting. I'm trying to just use the Internet! People should be able to use the Internet without being harassed. No!  Nobody cares about your fat sister with Lyme Disease, skank. Oh you got to be--Are you joking?! Buddies like when? When were we buddies? I don't have time for you! I'm sorry, dude, but I have a life. I have a wife, and kids,  and shit to do! Because you won't go away and let me just have fun!  Oh here we go!  Yes it is! You mean my  fucking screensaver. And what are  you, Dildo Shwaggins? Huh? You think you're a fucking political activist hauled up in your shitty little midget condo. You're nothing but a pissed off little giant, lashing out at everyone because you can't get laid! Stop trolling me. Stop fucking trolling me.  Oh my god. Oh my god, they've done it. Ah! No! No no no no no!  Dildo, they done it! The Danish figured out how to hack everyone's Internet history! Ahhh! 
Oh God...   They're coming for me, Sheila! They know everything! Everything I did online! It's over! Sheila! I'm sorry, Sheila. Please know that I love you so much. Goodbye Kyle, Ike.  Where are you taking me?  Dildo? Turd Sandwich... I don't understand. My help? Exactly! What do you want me to do? You mean like... like James Bond?  Wow...  And then everything can go back to normal. That depends. Are you asking me? Or are you asking...  Hi Ike, it's Daddy. Everything OK there?  Well it turns out that even the- Oh, hey Kyle. Tell your mom everything's fine, okay? I'm helping out the government. It's top-secret stuff, but everything's finally gonna be okay. Kyle, you've gotta lighten the fuck up, buddy. Every day with you it's "Dad, I feel guilty about this. Dad, I'm so confused about that." You're a kid. You're supposed to just laugh and make fun of shit.  Miller. Von Miller.  I'm the ambassador of technology from the Turkish Islands. That's right. Nice little country you have here. Really clean. Mhm.  Oh. Yes, they're nice. Ah, I wouldn't know. Ha, haha. No, no I, I-I'm just anxious to get a look at your servers. They must be quite impressive. Ahhh... no. Oh, wow. That's terrible. I'm fine. I... I think the frikadellers gave me a little heartburn. Ah, if you wouldn't mind, could I see the servers now? Thank you.   What the-? Dildo? What the fuck are you doing here? Nononononono, that's what I'm doing. Hillary Clinton says I was the only one capable of- All of us? Who?  What the hell is going on? No!  
Please, you have to let me outta here!  You can't hold people prisoner! I haven't done anything! People are gonna be looking for me! Ike?! Ike, buddy, can you hear me?! I need you to do something, okay? Daddy needs your help! I need you to go to your browser and sign on to the school message board, okay? Can you do that for me? The school message board and then log in. Lowercase S, skank-hunt-4-2. You got it?  If Skankhunt is still out there trolling, then they have the wrong guy! Get it?! It's called "using your brain", fatso! Nobody cares if a kid trolls! What are they gonna do, get a slap on the wrist? You don't know my fucking wife!  Ike, you got it? Great, pal! Okay, now I need you to go to the comment section, okay, and type in "You should all get raped by gorillas". You got that pal? Ike, "You should all get raped by gorillas"! Come on, we have a lot of work to do here! Okay now make sure the little worm is in the woman's mouth, got it? Now I need you to type "You're a fat retard" in the comments. No, you have to say "a fat retard", Ike! It's a nuance, but it's very important!   Hey sweetheart, how's everything going? Are you serious? God dang it! Let me talk to him right now! Hey Ike, just stay calm and act like I'm yelling at you, okay pal? Okay, give it a few seconds, wait. Good. Okay, now--now say "I'm sorry, dad. I guess I'm just fucked up inside". Ike, you have to listen to me. On your mother's life, this is a matter of national security! You have to say "I'm sorry, dad. I guess I'm just fucked up inside"! That was amazing, kiddo. It'll all be worth it, okay? I'll make this up to you. Give me back to your mom. He's full of shit, he's not sorry! If he felt sorry, he wouldn't be able to do it in the first place! I'm gonna get home as soon as I can to deal with this, okay? We can deal with this together. Just don't say anything to anyone for now, all right?  Ike! Okay there's just a few more things I need you to do. I need you to type "How'd you like a donkey dick?". You're suppose to just laugh and make fun of shit. 
Ike, where the fuck have you been?! Daddy needs your help. You don't want Mommy and Daddy to get divorced, do you?  You know how bad your mom is, she completely overreacts to everything. That's where your brother gets it from. You don't want to be like Kyle, do you?  Hey, buddy! Everything good there? No, it was your brother. I don't know what's wrong with him, Kyle. He needs counseling...  Shh, shh. Shh, shh. Okay, keep your voice down. Because it's fucking funny, Kyle. It's called having a sense of humor, and laughing. You should fucking try it once in a while! Because it's so not funny, God! Pushing people's buttons to get a reaction can actually be very good for society, Kyle. Listen to me, the Danish are fucking crazy. You have to get people to stop them. Go get people riled up. Call the President. I don't know. When you push people's buttons, they go and push other people's buttons. Now get out there and...  Oh thank god. There's been a mistake, okay?! I'm not one of  them. My son is Skankhunt42. Go online and see, he's still doing it!  That's a positive thing, right?! I wasn't doing it to hurt people, I was just doing comedy. It's different! Please, it's different!  You were right, Dildo, when you said I was a dick, when you called me an asshole. I am. And now I'm going to die alone, just like you said (starts crying again)  You said I was, though, 'cause I only trolled to be...funny.  Really? You don't think I'm a bad person? I'm sorry. All you guys, I'm sorry.  Excuse me. Hello? Could I please speak to the person in charge?  Please, just for a moment?  Oh, my gosh. Thank you so much for talking to me. I just really needed to get something off my chest. I'm so sorry. I had the biggest epiphany about the damage I've done, the people I've hurt, but the fact of the matter is I'm not really a troll.  I actually have a job. I'm a lawyer. I've got a loving wife and great kids. Uhm, I've got a family that really misses me and needs me. And that--that is so tragic. And I'm so sorry that she was driven to kill herself by trolling. It's--It's wrong. But, you know, I just sort of set things in motion. See, I'm a satirist. I challenge people's point of views by being sort of edgy.  And sometimes, people can be like "Whoa!" and mistake that for hate, but its not hate. Its pointing out hypocrisies in out society.  If you say mean things and you're mean, then I agree, you should be killed. But if you're being funny, which spreads joy -- It's not? And that was wrong, too. I certainly want to apologize for that. I-I don't understand. No way. You would--deliberately start World War III, let the people of Denmark die, set everyone on Earth against each other? Why?! That's not funny. You can't do this to people! It's not right! Waaiitt!!! 
Dildo? Yes! Yes, where are you? How long before the website goes online? Oh God! ''My'' account?  That's my boy!  Ah! God damn it!  Yeah, I'm here.  I can't go anywhere. I'm locked in the conference room.  Yeah...?  Yeah, I'm up with all the servers. [notices the lever] Yeah, I got it [grabs the lever] I think so. I-I'm up on some kind of bridgeway. Heading to it now! Get out of my way. What you're doing is wrong! It's completely heartless and malicious! No! Its not! Hacking the world to show that most people act differently online isn't even technically satirical. Okay, okay, look. What you're doing is just trying to prove that everyone is either a bad person or a snoop, right? So how is that funny? No, but see, that's just nihilism. That is! You're trying to get people to go to war and kill each other. I can't argue with you anymore. I want to stand here and tell you that you and I are different, but its not true.  All we've been doing is making excuses for being horrible people.  I don't know if you tried to teach me a lesson, but you have.  I have to stand here and look at you, and all I see is a big fat reflection of myself.  With only one minor difference. Ha! Fuck you! What I do is fucking funny, bitch! 
<poem><i>I want candy.</i></poem> Lookin' good, Ryan. Alright, Randy's got the JD! Sup, Stephen, Chip. Everybody up the hill!  Hey Randy. It's a witch chase and shoot 'em up. Yes they are, boys! And next they'll be coming after you! 'Cause you're all little sons a witches! Well, we did it, guys. 
Look, I'm sorry, but I learned a long time ago that if you defend poop, you get stained.  
Aah! Aaaah! Here! Here, take it! Just take it! 
 What is it, Kyle? Hey, were my boxes there too? Jeff Bezos? The founder and CEO of Amazon? Well, can he find my packages too?  I don't really care. I just want my stuff. If I have to work at Amazon to get my packages, then so be it. 
 We're American citizens! Get the fuck out of my house!  This is ridiculous! You can't take our children away from us! I-I'm telling you, I just don't know where our passports are! 
Well, what do we do now? 
Believe what? Your text said that- It's a hamburger? This tastes like shit.  I just- I just don't think it's very good.  Yeah, it's good.  Whoa. It's really fucking good, man! This is like the best burger I've ever had! 
Randy? 
No! Never! It just came outta nowhere! No! I mean... I've enjoyed a little of the Pandemic Special... 
 Oh, okay, Kyle. Sounds good! Thanks, buddy! Hey, we trust you, Kyle!  Say, Kyle, we heard you have some COVID-19 vaccinations. Oh, okay. Yeah, that makes sense. You know, if you think your teacher is worth saving more than us... Well, it sounds like that! Sounds like your teacher's life is more important than your mom and dad's!  School kind of abandoned you kids. But your parents, well... we didn't shove you off into a Zoom meeting, did we? You know, we're not spring chickens anymore.  The virus is still out there, Kyle, and it's still killing people. I don't know how you'd feel if mom or me got COVID and died in these last few months because you did nothing. Don't do nothing, Kyle. You know what, Kyle? Silence is violence, Kyle. Don't kill mom, buddy.   Hey, Garrison! Good job! 
 Wha– Wha– What? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!  Okay, okay, Kyle, breathe. "Airsoft Armory"? My God! Is this stuff real?! I-I really don't think your mom would approve, Kyle… This stuff is expensive! Is this really how you want to spend your allowance? These are all, like, legal, right? So it's all totally safe? What people mostly play Airsoft? Hey, Kyle… Uh, how did the Airsoft go? Are you sure this isn't all a little too much for you, son? I love you too, Kyle. He's just… experimenting.  Hey, buddy, what's up? I thought you were gonna go out and play Airsoft today? Oh.  D-Did something happen? Oh. Well, you know, they say that the… brain chemistry of a teenager is the same as that of a psychopath. The hormones and all that—it's been proven they're literally criminally insane.  Oh, buddy. Well, maybe you could ask the Airsoft field to let you play without the teenagers. Well… did you guys ever consider your dads? Come on in, boys.  What do you think? This one can shoot a thousand BBs in like five seconds. No, it's safe. See? As long as your gun has a red tip and you're white, police won't shoot you. We need some equipment. We're gonna try and take out some teenagers. Yeah, well, I've got something bigger.  American Express Platinum. Give me one of everything you have. This army! Did you see how those teenagers ran? Hey, that's what we're here for, right? We're just glad you wanted to spend some time with us.  Not yet… we still have a few good years before they turn into monsters.
