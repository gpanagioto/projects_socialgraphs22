Hello young people, and welcome to the most fascinating time of your life. You have braved the trials of childhood, and now you are reaching Canadian puberty. By now, you've probably noticed some changes in your body. For instance, when you fart your dick gets hard.  Other physical changes are happening to your body as well. If you're a boy you may notice that your testicles ache, or if you're a girl, you may notice a tingling sensation in your strange. Going through Canadian puberty, you may notice that your voice is starting to change as well. You're saying things like "hey boddy" and "hey guy" because now that you're older you're discovering that someone who was once your buddy is now your guy, and someone who you used to call "guy" is quickly becoming your friend.  Make me look like an idiot, will you?! Ey! You told me you queefed on my face because because that's how babies are born! Being sarcastic?! I just told a million Canadian teenages that's how it's done! Fine! You want me to go with you to therapy?! Fine! Totally embarrassing and degrading! She queefed right in my face! I try not to think about it, Rick. I try to just forget aboot it and then move on, but I can't. I mean... she queefed right in my face! Yes, we went but... I just can't erase the memory of my helpless face being queefed on like that. Who's to say she won't do it again? What do you mean?
