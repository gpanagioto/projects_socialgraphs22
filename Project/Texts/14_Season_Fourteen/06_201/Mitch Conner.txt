Saigon. It's a hell of a place. I've seen a lot of death.  No, I don't like a little blood. Blood ain't the stuff for eighteen year old boys from Sheboygan. Blood ain't the stuff... for Mitch Conner. And that's that. "Pack your bags, you're headed home. Hugs and kisses from Uncle Sam."  So how do I end up here, with a nine year old kid who just wants to know who his father is? Life is funny like that. One day you're sifting through the guts of some gook in Vietnam and the next you're playing Dr. Phil with some kid and his teacher. Sorry is a four letter word with a Y on the end. That doesn't mean anything to this poor kid. Yeah, the old "Hasn't anything changed?" speech. Works on white people all the time. Is Muhammad more important than a little boy's broken heart? Look, Mephesto, just tell this kid who his father is and you do it now! You really got yourself in a mess this time, kid. You might wanna   Hey, Eric, Eric! Come on, cheer up. Yeah, but you're forgetting, you're also half Denver Bronco. That makes you pretty cool. Shut up, Kyle, you dumb Jew.  You've got Bronco blood in you, kid. That makes you awesome. Me? I should be movin' on. There's a bounty on my head and I can't afford to stay in one place for too long. So long... Denver Bronco.
