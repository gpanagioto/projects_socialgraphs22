 Hey Kelly. How's it going? Hey there! How are you? Good times, good times! Ho, that's not a problem at all. Scientology is more like an alternative to psychology than a religion. Oho, that's just this thing: What's the Denver Broncos' record now? Six and two? Wow! That's great! All right, come on in and take a seat; we're gonna have some fun!  Okay. Number 1: Do you ever make remarks... which you later regret? Uh huh. Would you rather give orders... than take them? Do you ever whistle... just for the fun of it.  Okay, and finally, does life sometimes feel vague and confusing to you? Okay, Stan. Well, that's it. That's the end of the personality test. Well, I hate to tell you this, Stan, but... you are one messed-up kid. Yeah, I'm afraid that you are completely miserable ''and'' totally depressed. Well there's certainly no question that you are a perfect candidate for Scientology. I think it can really make you happy again. It's very simple. We just need two hundred and forty dollars.  Yep- Oh hey there, Greg! Huh, well. We'll get another E-meter - this one's obviously broken. Sorry about this, Greg. Mike, I need to talk to you!  Take a look at this. The E-meter results from the little boy in Room D We ran the tests four times! We used four different E-meters! Oh! We are gonna ''sue'' you! 
And now, Jambu is going to going to give you all a big wave!  Now get ready for Jambu's next trick.   We hope you enjoyed Jambu's orca show, and enjoy the rest of your day at Denver's Sea Park!  Dude, did you see that episode of ''Trading Spouses'' last night? That was insane. Yeah, well ha- whoa. What the hell?  What happened? We can't tell them, then they're, they're gonna think this is all ''our'' fault How were we supposed to know that they were gonna actually do it?!  we've just gotta make this right ourselves. We've gotta track down those kids. Before the police do! Will you relax? Those kids said they were from South Park. We've just gotta go door to door. Do you have the composite sketch we did? Let's go!   Oh my good, look! We're close. We're really close!  Oh... h-hello ma'am. We're just here to examine your pool. Ma'am, do you recognize any of these boys?  We don't know that!  It WAS funny!! It ''was funny'', Bob! And it will be funny again, I swear to you! If those boys took the whale out of here, we would have seen them on the road! I'm telling you, we're close. It's going to be funny! Eh hello ma'am, uh, the teacher at the school said she recognized this boy to be your son?  Ma'am, we need to talk to your son, please! It's very urgent! Which highway did they take?? All right, out of the truck! You're carrying a stolen whale! Come on out, kid.  Just help us get the whale into our truck and we'll all keep quiet about this. Aw crap. Mike? Mike?? Don't say that, Mike. It was funny. It just wasn't that funny this time.  All the other times were still funny, Mike! They were still funny!! 
We drink and take drugs. It's the only thing that allows us to deal with our parents all walking around loving the smell of their own farts all the time. 
You mean like the time you had tea with Mohammad, the prophet of the Muslim faith?  
 Ready to go, sir. 
Ms. Clinton, we just received word of a possible terrorist attack on your rally today. We aren't sure, but... perhaps it's best we call it off.  Otis Green, anything on that bomb threat?  What?!  Oh my God! Where?! Where could they have stashed it?! My God, they hid it under the stage?! Security measure, Mrs. Clinton. Probably nothing.  Yes. A what?! No, I mean what kind of nuclear device?! Ms. Clinton, it appears that terrorists have snuck a snuke up your snizz. What do we do? Can we disable the timer? But then that means... You're doing great, Ms. Clinton. They'll find the detonator, Hildog.  I'll do it! I'll check out Ms. Clinton's snizz.  All right. I'm nearing her snizz now. It's dark... cold... Uh, uh, all right, I'm looking. Yes, I see... I see the device!  There's um, metal housing... some kind of three-pronged triggering mechanism that... Wait there's... there's something else here! There's something...   There's something perched on the snuke's coil... Oh God, it's looking at me! Wha... what are you?! I have no qualm with you! Stay back! Stay back I- agh! Aaagh! It's... eating my head! It's eating my head!  
 But it's money Goddammit and this channel needs it! I'm sorry, Terrance & Phillip, your show is done! 
Come on, honey.  
This is Brian with INsecurity, is everything all right? I'm sending help. Police are on their way with blankets and cocoa. Ho- hold on one second, sir, I have another emergency coming in.  This is Brian with INsecurity, is everything all right? 
That's great, Nancy. Now put down your phone.
