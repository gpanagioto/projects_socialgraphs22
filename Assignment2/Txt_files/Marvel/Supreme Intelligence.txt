==Fictional character biography==
The Supreme Intelligence, also known by the honorific title Supremor, was created more than a million years ago on the planet Kree-Lar by the extraterrestrial race known as the [[Kree]] to help them create a [[Cosmic Cube]] like their enemies the [[Skrull]]s had once created. The Supreme Intelligence is composed of the brains of the greatest Kree minds (namely the Kree's [[Intellectual|thinkers]], [[General officer|generals]], [[philosopher]]s, [[scientist]]s, and so on) that were removed upon their deaths and [[Mind uploading|assimilated by the computer]], adding their knowledge and experience to its own.

Eventually, the Supreme Intelligence developed a mind of its own and refused to create the Cosmic Cube knowing the dangers that could be wrought by an evolved Cosmic Cube, which was what had destroyed massive parts of the Skrull Empire.

Despite this, it was allowed to continue to exist to serve the Kree with its wisdom. Its influence eventually grew to the point where it replaced the Kree government as Ruler of the Kree Empire, although it has occasionally been subsequently deposed for periods of time. Most of the Kree are fanatically devoted to it, and its worship is an organized religion.

Early in the career of the [[Fantastic Four]], the Supreme Intelligence sent [[Ronan the Accuser]] to execute them.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #65. Marvel Comics.</ref> It later discovered the treachery of [[Zarek (comics)|Zarek]] and Ronan, and then honored Kree hero [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Mar-Vell]] with a new uniform.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #16. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Supreme Intelligence was deposed as the leader of the Kree Empire by Ronan.<ref>''The Avengers'' #89. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Supreme Intelligence was revealed to have mentally influenced the human [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] and the U.S. Alien Activities Commission from behind the scenes in order to regain its power.<ref>''The Avengers'' #96. Marvel Comics.</ref> It stimulated Rick Jones's psionic potential, the evolutionary potential of the human race, otherwise known as the Destiny Force, to end the Earth vicinity campaign in the first [[Kree-Skrull War]]. The Supremor revealed that it realized long ago that the Kree were at an [[evolution]]ary dead-end. Its main concern became to find a way to jump-start its race's evolution, and its manipulations of Rick Jones and Mar-Vell were part of this process. The Supreme Intelligence then regained leadership of the Kree Empire.<ref>''The Avengers'' #97. Marvel Comics.</ref> Later, it mentally dominated Ronan, and used Ronan as a pawn in battle against Rick Jones and Captain Marvel.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #41. Marvel Comics.</ref> It attempted to absorb the minds of Rick Jones and Captain Marvel, and employed the remote control Supremor androids as a housing for its consciousness.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #46. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Supremor understood that the Skrulls lost their ability to shapeshift, and plotted a new campaign for a second Kree-Skrull War.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 2 #6. Marvel Comics.</ref> During this war, the Supreme Intelligence acquired the Soul Gem, which the creature used to maintain peaceful balance between its blue and pink Kree components. It used the Soul Gem to absorb the soul of the [[Silver Surfer]].<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 2 #7. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Silver Surfer's soul escaped from him and removed the Soul Gem, causing the Supreme Intelligence to lose its sanity.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' Vol. 2 #8. Marvel Comics.</ref> Afterwards, [[Nenora]], a Skrull spy in the guise of a high-ranking Kree official, took command of the Kree empire. The war ended with Nenora being exposed as a Skrull.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 2 #13. Marvel Comics.</ref> The [[Contemplator (Marvel Comics)|Contemplator]] later began restructuring the Supreme Intelligence's scrambled consciousness.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 2 #29. Marvel Comics.</ref> It was then taken over by the mind of the Contemplator.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 2 #30. Marvel Comics.</ref> It was soon liberated from the Contemplator's control by a [[Cotati (comics)|Cotati]] wizard, although under the Cotati's influence the Supreme Intelligence appointed the alien "Clumsy Foulup" as the supreme Kree Leader.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 2 #31. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Supremor was restored to power a while later.<ref>''Captain America'' #398. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Operation: Galactic Storm]]" storyline, the Supremor secretly arranged to have a "[[Nega-Bomb]]" (a device producing a special kind of radiation gathered from the Negative Zone) detonated in the Kree Galaxy, hoping its energies would reactivate the Kree's genetic potential. But in the process, billions of Kree were killed. This led a group of [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] to decide to execute it for genocide, against the wishes of the rest of the team.<ref>{{cite comic|title=Avengers|volume=1|issue=#347|writer=[[Bob Harras]]|artist=[[Steven Epting]]|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|date=May, 1992}}</ref>

Supremor wasn't killed; prior to the death of its host computer, it beamed itself to an awaiting starship hidden from the conflict between the Kree and Shi'ar. This ship later was damaged and found by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], who captured the small computer Supremor was now residing in. S.H.I.E.L.D. kept the Supreme Intelligence on the Earth's moon for study, as Supremor bided its time.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

The Kree Empire fell after the Kree-Shi'ar War, with the Kree Empire placed under the rule of the Shi'ar Imperium ruled by Deathbird. The Kree [[Starforce]] were her enforcers, now turned into a branch of the Imperial Guard. The Supremor android on the Star Force acted as the Supreme Intelligence's spy into the workings of the remaining Kree Empire.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

The Supreme Intelligence soon escaped after it possessed the minds of some S.H.I.E.L.D. scientists and had its body taken to Manhattan, where it planned to explode another Nega-Bomb, this time in the sewers of Manhattan. The Supremor witnessed the first Kree mutation when it encountered one of the Kree Imperial Guard Commando who underwent his mutation when he sought to destroy the computer housing the Supreme Intelligence; however, it was this act that freed Supremor, allowing it to return to the depths of space.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

Supremor reached the Kree Empire and had a new housing constructed for it, as it soon managed to obtain the Forever Crystal, a very powerful mystical artifact, from [[Kang the Conqueror]],<ref>''[[Avengers Forever]]'' #1-12 (1998-1999). Marvel Comics.</ref> and used it to advance the Kree's evolution, creating a supposedly new race, the Ruul. Through them, it manipulated the Intergalactic Council into turning against the Earth, but its plans were stopped by the Avengers.<ref>{{cite comic|title=Maximum Security|volume=1|issue=#3|writer=[[Kurt Busiek]]|artist=[[Jerry Ordway]]|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|date=January, 2001}}</ref>

Later on the Intelligence got its wish for more genetic stock for the Kree, when some of the [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] tribes reunited with the regrowing Kree Empire. Combined with the Ruul and the mutated Kree, the Kree Empire would soon rise again after throwing off the shackles of the [[Shi'ar]] Empire. After the universe was destroyed and recreated by [[Genis-Vell]] and Entropy: Son of [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]], the Kree race was restored to its original form.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

As of ''Annihilation #2'' it has been declared that the Supreme Intelligence is not in command of the Kree Empire, having been replaced by the merchant House of Fiyero. House Fiyero, in fact, placed the Supreme Intelligence in a state of "living death" and ruled the Kree without its consent. Ronan The Accuser is told by the being's caretakers that it longed for Ronan to return and set the Kree on the correct path against the Annihilation Wave. Realizing that there was nothing to be done to restore the creature to life, Ronan instead shattered the tank and left it to die rather than live in pain, after deposing House Fiyero for their treachery.<ref>''Annihilation'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Supreme Intelligence was seen in ''Annihilation Conquest'' where his remains had been retrieved by the Phalanx who are attempting to reactivate him.{{Issue|date=August 2009}} By reactivating the Supreme Intelligence the Phalanx plan to send a mental echo across space containing a message that will invade the minds of the Kree, turning every Kree in the galaxy into Phalanx at once.{{Issue|date=August 2009}}  This was foiled by the arrival of the being [[Wraith (Zak-Del)|Wraith]], who allowed the weapon to activate, and used his Exolon swarm to absorb the soul of Supremor, essentially housing the spirit within himself.<ref>''Wraith'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

On Earth, [[Noh-Varr]] (who was the [[Prison warden|warden]] of the superhuman prison [[The Cube (comics)|The Cube]] at the time) devotes most of his resources into trying to revive the Supreme Intelligence in order to realize his dream of a New Kree Empire.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

An alternate reality Supreme Intelligence appears in the form of a holographic message that tells Noh-Varr that the actions of the Skrulls during "[[Secret Invasion]]" have left Earth in more danger than ever before and that he is the planet's new protector. The Supreme Intelligence then grants him the power needed to carry out his mission in the form a set of Nega-Bands, more advanced than the ones worn by Captain Marvel. The bands also provide him with a new costume and prevents the Dark Avengers from detecting his presence.{{Issue|date=January 2010}}

[[Ronan the Accuser]] later resurrected the original Supreme Intelligence by melding two alternate reality [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] with the Supremor Seed (a small portion of the Supreme Intelligence held dormant in the Accuser's hammer), a plan devised by the Supreme Intelligence himself 300,000 years ago when he calculated his possible defeat and death in the future.<ref>''FF'' #11 (2011). Marvel Comics.</ref> He later informs Noh-Varr of the coming of the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Force]] to Earth and orders him to help his Avengers teammates intercept the entity. However, he also must contain it at all costs, even if it means eliminating his teammates.{{issue|date=April 2012}}

During the "[[Infinity (comic book)|Infinity]]" storyline, the Supreme Intelligence and Ronan the Accuser appeared as members of the Galactic Council.<ref>''Infinity'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> While initially helpful with the Galactic Council's efforts to halt the march of the Builders, the Intelligence commanded its people to surrender once the Kree homeworld was taken by the Builders. After Ronan and his Accuser Corps fractured away to continue the battle, the Supreme Intelligence gave them blanket amnesty upon the success of the campaign.<ref>''Infinity'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During "[[The Black Vortex]]" storyline, the Supreme Intelligence learns of the Black Vortex' resurgence and sends Ronan and the Accuser Corps to retrieve it from [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], [[Gamora]], and the time-displaced [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]]. In retaliation for the Accuser Corps attack, the three cosmic-enhanced characters attacked Hala.<ref>''All-New X-Men'' #38-39. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Supreme Intelligence denied Ronan the Accuser's suggestion to use the Black Vortex on them. Though Ronan the Accuser did it anyway and drove off Beast, Gamora, and Angel.<ref>''Guardians Team-Up'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Slaughter Lords led by [[J'son (character)|Mister Knife]] show up with plans to obtain the Black Vortex. As the Slaughter Lords start to destroy Hala, the Supreme Intelligence ordered the Accuser Corps to leave Hala while it stayed behind.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' vol. 3 #25. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Inhuman Royal Family's expedition led by Noh-Varr later arrived on Hala. Noh-Varr planted the a seed from We-Plex Supreme Intelligence System from Earth-200080 into the Supreme Intelligence's remains. This resulted in the resurrection of the Plex Intelligence as it absorbs the material from the other Supreme Intelligence.<ref>''Royals'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Infinity Countdown]]" storyline, this new form of the Supreme Intelligence was renamed the Extreme Intelligence. It planned to have the Infinity Gems acquired so that it can resurrect the Kree empire.<ref>''Infinity Countdown: Darkhawk'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Kree Supreme Intelligence is a vast cybernetic/organic computer system composed of 5,000 cubic meters of computer circuitry incorporating the disembodied brains of the greatest statesmen and philosophers in Kree history, preserved cryogenically. This aggregation of brains creates a single [[collective intelligence]] able to use the vast information storage and processing capabilities of the computer system in a creative way. When wishing to interact with it, the Kree address it within its terminal chamber, where a holographic image is projected on a gigantic monitor screen.

The Supreme Intelligence possesses a seemingly immeasurable intellect, with vast knowledge far surpassing that of present-day Earth. It possesses information storage and processing abilities far above that of the human brain, and has access to the total resources of the Kree Empire. Despite being stationary and basically immobile, the Intelligence possesses all known psionic powers, such as telepathy, precognition, telekinesis, cosmic awareness, sensory link, information absorption, postcognition, etc.

Supremor is also capable of manipulating energy and matter, as well as create up to three remote controlled android servitors as surrogate bodies, that act as its eyes and ears when away from itself. These androids, called [[Supremor]] also, possess some degree of independence when created, but are totally loyal to Supremor.

It projects images of itself across space, Cyberspace and even into the Astral Plane, in the form of a huge, amorphous, greenish, humanoid face, with tentacle-like "hair", to communicate with its agents scattered across the cosmos. It has even assumed the form of an orange dragon with a green-skinned octopus as its head, called the Multitude.

Its power was enhanced when it merged with an inert Cosmic Cube, which now serves as its true housing, kept in a separate room from the organic computer facade it created to fool would-be assassins. Upon assuming its new housing, Supremor was now able to control reality within a limited distance of itself, as well as able to open up portals between dimensions, most notably the Astral Plane and the dimension of Death.

==Other versions==
===Marvel Boy===
The ''Marvel Boy'' mini-series by [[Grant Morrison]] featured an alternate version of Supremor from a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]].{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}  This entity served as a database and ally for [[Noh-Varr]], the last survivor of a Kree ship that crashed to Earth. Known as ''Plex'', this Supreme Intelligence displayed a type of [[Dissociative identity disorder|multiple personalities]] with each type of mind being able to dominate in specific situations (i.e. "Plex-Soldiers," "Plex-Scientists" even "Plex-Murderers" and "Plex-infants") to advise the ship in which it was housed.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

The Supreme Intelligence did show an ability to dominate Earth technology remotely and to teleport itself and the ship short distances.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} It was also shown to control [[insect]]like creatures that inhabited the ship.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} All these powers were achieved via transmission of a signal called "The Omni-Wave."
