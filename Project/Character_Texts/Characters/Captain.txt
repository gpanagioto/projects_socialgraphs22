Hello, ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. If you look out the right side of the aircraft you can see some interesting shit.  
Two hundred years we've waited. Finally. We will get those traitors to the Crown!  Yes, Your Majesty? Full sail, Your Majesty? The Rebel Americans know of our attack?! Fire at will!  Your Majesty, the attack has failed. We were... unable to end the American Revolution. 
You with the gun, step out or we will fire upon you. All right men, come on. We're going in. Go inside! Move!  Everyone just stay where you are until we can sort this all out. We're going to search everyone and get statements! And the- Got who?  Hohhh, they got them. 
That's definitely a Japanese boat.  Pull up next to them. The fight is on!  Are we ready to do this? Are we badasses? Are we badasses? All right, so... what do we do?  Wait, I know. How about we go on their ship, and then beat ourselves up? And then we can tell the media ''they'' did it? Wait, wait wait. I've got a better idea. How about I pretend to be shot? Then we can tell the media the Japanese shot me, a-and start an international c-crisis? Why not? You know what? He's right. It's time to bring out the big guns! You guys ready?  Yeah, we make 'em stink. Haha your boat is stinky! Here, th- here, throw one. Well no, that'd be illegal. We are. People think our methods are extreme. But we'll keep making their boats stink as long as they're killing whales and dolphins! 
This is the U.S. Coast Guard! We have instructions to take you by force, if necessary!  God damn it. You people just don't give up, do ya? 
Alright what the hell is going on here?! Stall them. I don't want that plane landing anywhere until we know what the hell we're dealing with! Survival of what? Oh my God. 
Baka! Kora wa sugoi cheating desu!
