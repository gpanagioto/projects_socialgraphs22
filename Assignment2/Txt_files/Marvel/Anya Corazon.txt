==Fictional character biography==

===Origin===
[[File:Arana.jpg|thumb|Anya Corazon as Araña from ''Araña: The Heart of the Spider'' #1. Art by [[Mark Brooks (comics)|Mark Brooks]].]]
On her first day at Milton Summers [[high school|High School]] in [[Fort Greene, Brooklyn]], Anya is friends with classmate Lynn Sakura. She is later caught in a skirmish between two mystical clans, the Spider Society and the Sisterhood of the Wasp, and is mortally wounded. To save her life, the mage Miguel Legar from the Spider Society performs a ritual on her by giving her a spider-shaped tattoo that endows her with spider-like powers, and recruits her to be a Hunter for the Spider Society. WebCorps operatives Nina Smith and Ted Mankowski offer her various costumes, but she decides to make her own costume. She designs a costume as "Araña" with red and blue sneakers, blue track pants, red backpack, red gloves with many pockets, and large yellow-lensed goggles. As part of her powers, an insectoid exoskeleton covers most of her body with a bug-like bluish skin. In place of equipment like web-shooters or spider tracers, Anya created her own modified bolas out of discs that are about the size of her palm and have eight red legs able to grip objects. Anya fights a Hunter from The Sisterhood of the Wasp, adversaries of the Spider Society.<ref name="AmazingFantasy">''Amazing Fantasy'' vol. 2 #1-6 (Aug. 2004-Jan. 2005)</ref>

===Heart of the Spider===
While interrogating a spy for the Sisterhood of the Wasp, Anya and Miguel discover that the Sisterhood of the Wasp has recruited a fifteen-year-old boy codenamed Amun, a descendant of Egyptian assassins who believes the boy is skilled enough to not need to conceal his own identity. Anya soon meets Amun who has enrolled at her school under the name Jon Kasiya. The two soon deduce the other's dual identity. Later, during a fight with Anya, Miguel, and the Sisterhood of the Wasp, Amun tells her that Amun will attack her loved ones if she opposes. Noting her father [[List of Marvel Comics characters: C#Gil Corazon|Gil Corazon]] is filming the fight, Anya takes Gil to safety. In her absence, Amun seriously wounds Miguel. The encounter leaves Anya doubting her duty due to the danger it poses to her loved ones. However, in a chance encounter, [[Spider-Man]] arrives and, after discussing her origins and adventures, tells her, "With great power comes great responsibility" and that in every age, people are called to be heroes. Soon afterward, Anya fights Amun and, in anger, nearly strangles Amun to death. She is stopped and Amun runs. She learns she had released "the Spirit of the Hunter" and warned not to do it again without Miguel with her. Back at WebCorps, Miguel is revived upon being reunited with Anya, and Miguel tells her the organization's history that would eventually split into Wasps and Spiders. After an encounter with a gunman in a coffee shop, in which Anya saves Lynn and Amun without revealing her [[secret identity]], Amun promises to respect her double life and to stop targeting her friends and family.<ref>''Araña: The Heart of the Spider'' #1-6 (March 2005-Aug. 2005)</ref>

===Night of the Hunter===
The Sisterhood of the Wasp recruits Jaime Jade, a Mexican crime lord who has mental abilities that allows to hypnotize other people and was involved in the death of her mother [[Arana (comics)|Sofia Corazon]]. Miguel stops Anya from going after Jade alone with the promise that Anya can punish Jade afterwards. Anya and Amun develop a loose truce because Amun has lost his father as well, so he checks into Jade's possible involvement in Sofia's death. Jade hypnotizes Anya into fighting Miguel, but she eventually breaks free of the control and knocks Jade out. When Jade wakes up, the car Jade is in is suspended by a rope over the river. Jade thinks she's bluffing, saying "Little miss super hero won't want my death on her conscience." to which she replies "No, my conscience feels fine," and lets go of the rope. Amun arrives too late, but Anya reluctantly dives into the water to save Jade but the crime lord has already escaped.<ref name="AranaHeartSpider">''Araña: The Heart of the Spider'' #7-12 (Sept. 2005-Feb. 2006)</ref>

===Spider-Man/Araña: The Hunter Revealed===

Before a battle with [[Doomsday Man]], Ms. Marvel asks Anya to go get help if she fails to make contact by a certain time.

==Powers and abilities==
===As Araña===
As Araña, she originally possessed superhuman strength (able to lift three tons), speed, stamina, reflexes/reactions, agility, coordination, balance, and endurance. Anya had the ability to cling to walls, and to sprout a spider-like exoskeleton around her body which enhanced these abilities and protected her from damage. When her exoskeleton was ripped out by Doomsday Man,<ref name="Ms.M12"/> she retained her primary powers. Anya invented spider-like grappling hooks, which she uses to swing from buildings and as whip-like weapons, though she has found these to be harder to use since losing her abilities.<ref name="SG1"/>

===As Spider-Girl===
<!-- Do NOT add information such as "able to lift 5 tons" to this section. That is unencyclopedic fancruft and will be removed. When making changes also be sure to check for typos, misspellings, and bad grammar before saving your changes. -->
Writer [[Paul Tobin (author)|Paul Tobin]] stated In an interview with [[Newsarama]] that as Spider-Girl, the character initially lacks superpowers, but Tobin will be "staying away from having her feel crippled by any power loss; it's for sure on her mind, but Anya is a character that wants to focus on what she ''can'' do." Tobin revealed that Anya regains her powers in the "[[Spider-Island]]" storyline.<ref name=SpiderIsland/><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/spider-girl-paul-tobin-100726.html | title=SDCC 2010: Paul Tobin on Araña Becoming Spider-Girl | last=Ching | first=Albert | work=Newsarama | date=July 26, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?id=32252&page=article|publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]|title= Spider-Girl Vacations on "Spider-Island"|date=May 10, 2011}}</ref> The [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]] copies Spider-Man's powers into the entire non-superhuman population of New York, including Anya.

In the middle of the battle Madame Web teleports herself to get Araña to confront and defeat Peter. Peter ends up blinded by a shotgun he was attempting to use on her. Araña takes over as the head Spider while Peter is left permanently blinded and distant from Mary Jane.<ref>''What If? Spider-Man: Grim Hunt''</ref>
