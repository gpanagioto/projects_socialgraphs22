'''Mastermind''' ('''Jason Wyngarde''') is a <!--Do not add "fictional" as it is tautological; supervillains (and characters in general) are by definition implied to be fictionalized to some extent.-->[[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He most often appears as an adversary of the [[X-Men]]. The original Mastermind was a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] with the psionic ability to generate complex [[telepathy|telepathic]] illusions at will that cause his victims to see whatever he wishes them to see. He was a founding member of the first [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] and later a probationary member of the Lords Cardinal of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]], where he played an important role in "''[[The Dark Phoenix Saga]]''".

After Wyngarde's death from the [[Legacy Virus]], his three daughters appeared: two possessing his illusion-creating abilities, [[Mastermind (Martinique Jason)]] and [[Lady Mastermind|Lady Mastermind (Regan Wyngarde)]], and the [[X-Men|X-Man]] [[Pixie (X-Men)|Pixie]].

==Publication history==
Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist/co-writer [[Jack Kirby]], he first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|The X-Men]]'' #4 (March 1964).

''The Uncanny X-Men'' #125 (Marvel Comics, Sept. 1979).</ref>

The name and visual appearance of Jason Wyngarde as he appears in the Dark Phoenix Saga and later stories was originally based by artist John Byrne on that of British actor [[Peter Wyngarde]], best known for playing [[Jason King (TV series)|Jason King]], and who also played the leader of the Hellfire Club in an episode of ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]''.<ref>Cronin, Brian.

==Fictional character biography==
Nothing is known of Jason Wyngarde's life before joining the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, except that he was a carnival mentalist. With Mastermind's help, the Brotherhood takes over Santo Marco, a fictional [[South America]]n country, with an illusion of thousands of soldiers. However, the X-Men free the country, as Professor X sees through Mastermind's illusions, helping the X-Men when they believe they are trapped by a wall of flame.<ref>''The X-Men'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> As a member of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, he participates in repeated clashes with the [[X-Men]]. He attempts to court his teammate [[Scarlet Witch]], but his advances seem driven more by an unsatisfied need for love than by any true feelings for her, and she repeatedly spurns him.<ref>''The X-Men'' #4-8; ''Journey into Mystery'' #109. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Brotherhood attempts to lure the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]] to their cause, but the Stranger temporarily turns Mastermind into solid matter.<ref>''The X-Men'' #11. Marvel Comics.</ref>

[[Image:ScarletXmen7.jpg|thumb|170px|left|Mastermind tries to gain the [[Scarlet Witch]] to his side.<br> Art by [[Jack Kirby]].]]
After the spell wears off, Mastermind joins [[Factor Three]], an organization that attempts to conquer the Earth. Factor Three eventually disbands when their leader turns out to be an alien, instead of a mutant. They team with the X-Men to defeat the alien [[Mutant Master]].<ref>''The X-Men'' #37-39. Marvel Comics.</ref> Mastermind is then captured by [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]], but freed by the X-Men.<ref>''The X-Men'' #59-60. Marvel Comics.</ref> Former members of Factor Three, [[Blob (comics)|Blob]] and [[Unus the Untouchable|Unus]], join with Mastermind to reform the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants.<ref>''X-Men: The Hidden Years'' #11. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Mastermind attempts to recruit [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] to his group, but fails and winds up battling him instead.<ref>''Amazing Adventures'' vol. 2 #12-13. Marvel Comics.</ref> Mastermind is briefly held captive by the second [[Secret Empire (organization)|Secret Empire]].<ref>''Captain America and the Falcon'' #174. Marvel Comics.</ref> Magneto returns to the Brotherhood to resume his leadership and creates [[Alpha the Ultimate Mutant]]. The Brotherhood of Evil Mutants battle the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], but Alpha turns the entire Brotherhood team into infants.<ref>''The Defenders'' #15-16. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After being restored to adulthood, Mastermind becomes involved with the Hellfire Club, who conspire to capture the X-Men for their own uses. He initially poses as Nikos, and begins a romance with [[Jean Grey#Phoenix|Phoenix]].<ref>''Classic X-Men'' #24. Marvel Comics.</ref> Then, he manipulates her through the use of his own powers and a mind-tap mechanism created by [[Emma Frost]], which he uses to project his illusion directly into her mind, causing her to believe she is living out the life of a Victorian aristocrat who was married to Jason Wyngarde (Mastermind),<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #122, 125-126, 129, 130. Marvel Comics.</ref> and was the Black Queen of the Hellfire Club. This turns her against the X-Men. [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] attempts to free Phoenix on the [[astral plane]], but Mastermind confronts him there and soundly defeats him. Instead of binding Phoenix to him forever, as Mastermind had hoped, the shock of Scott's psychic "death" breaks her free from his control. Enraged at what he did to her, Phoenix reaches into his mind and makes him experience godhood for a moment. This experience leaves him catatonic.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #132-134. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When Mastermind recovers his sanity, he seeks revenge on everyone that caused him pain. He strikes down Emma Frost, leaving her comatose.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #169. Marvel Comics.</ref> He unbalances [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]]'s shared psyche with [[Ms. Marvel|Carol Danvers]], prompting her to leave [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]], while using an induced nightmare on Mystique to let her know he is responsible.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #170. Marvel Comics.</ref> Next, since Phoenix is dead, he decides to use those closest to her as proxies for his revenge.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #175. Marvel Comics.</ref> He disrupts [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]'s wedding by psionically compelling his betrothed, [[Mariko Yashida]], to reject him and open up dealings with the criminal underworld.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #172-173. Marvel Comics.</ref> He manipulates the X-Men into thinking Cyclops's fiancée, [[Madelyne Pryor]], is the reincarnation of Dark Phoenix, hoping to goad them into killing her before he reveals the truth. However, Cyclops recognizes the patterns of Mastermind's power, and the X-Men defeat him in a short battle.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #174-175. Marvel Comics.</ref> Mastermind later seeks to tap into the power of the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Force]], but is defeated by [[Rachel Summers]] and [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]. He is imprisoned with the delusion that he achieved cosmic awareness.<ref>''Excalibur'' #26. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Mastermind later dies of the [[Legacy Virus]]. Before he succumbs, he asks [[Jean Grey]]'s forgiveness for what he did to her in an attempt to gain control of the almighty Phoenix Force within her. She forgives him and he dies peacefully after using his final act to save Jean Grey from dying alongside him.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' Annual #17 (1993, Marvel Comics). Marvel Comics.</ref>

After his death, Mastermind appeared in a flashback sequence that revealed that he was paid by the supervillain known as "the General" to put one of his illusions into the mind of [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]], making the Sentry "...so scared to use his powers, [That] he'll think the world will be attacked by the devil if he does." This would make Mastermind responsible for the creation of the Void itself, the evil counterpart of the Sentry who is actually the manifestation of the inhibitions that Mastermind implanted in the Sentry to prevent him from using his powers.<ref>''The New Avengers'' #9. Marvel Comics.</ref>

He would appear again in a flashback sequence when Lorna Dane discovered that she was the one responsible for the accident that killed her parents. Magneto, who had been drawn to the location of the accident by her magnetic pulse, had Mastermind use his illusionary powers to re-write Lorna's memories of that day, since he believed that she was not ready for her abilities or the life he could offer her, leaving her to believe that her parents died in a plane crash when she was an infant.<ref>''X-Factor'' #243. Marvel Comics.</ref>

[[Joseph (comics)|Joseph]] is resurrected under unknown circumstances and forms a new Brotherhood of Mutants with [[Astra (Marvel Comics)|Astra]] and mutated deformed versions of [[Blob (comics)|Blob]], Mastermind, [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], Scarlet Witch, and [[Toad (Marvel Comics)|Toad]], all actually clones created by Joseph.<ref>''Magneto: Not a Hero'' #1-4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Empyre]]" storyline, Mastermind is among the mutants that were revived and residing on Krakoa. When Magik calls for the psychic mutants to come to Genosha and deal with a [[Cotati (comics)|Cotati]] seed pod that is weak against psychic attacks, Mastermind is among the psychic mutants that answer the call.<ref>''Empyre: X-Men'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> He is among those who witness Magik's fight with the Cotatinaught.<ref>''Empyre: X-Men'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Mastermind's [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] ability is to cast exceptionally powerful realistic psionic illusions. He can psionically cause other people to see, hear, feel, smell, and/or taste things that do not actually exist.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Wilson |first=John |date=2019-08-06 |title=10 X-Men Villains that Seem Totally Lame (But Are Actually Super Powerful) |url=https://www.cbr.com/x-men-villains-seem-totally-lame-actually-super-powerful/ |access-date=2022-09-13 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref> He can also cause people to sense things in ways that they would not naturally; for example, he can make himself look and sound like a different person, or look and feel like a wall, or even seem invisible. For this to work, these people have to be within range of his powers. With artificial aids, Mastermind can cause only one person among many who are present to see his illusions. He is even capable of affecting telepaths as powerful as [[Professor X]]avier and [[Jean Grey]], although to manipulate [[The Dark Phoenix Saga|Dark Phoenix]] he required an amplifying device called a "mind-tap mechanism" provided by the [[Emma Frost|White Queen]] that enabled him to project illusions directly into the entity's mind, so that the entity "saw" them, and to monitor the entity's thoughts, both over great distances.{{issue|date=November 2014}} Emma Frost described his abilities to the [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]] in the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] storyline as something akin to a psionic virus, which he plants in the mind of the victim and allows to grow and change according to their view and feelings.{{issue|date=November 2014}} It would appear that these "viruses" can continue to function even without his influence, as the illusions placed in to the mind of the [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]] remained after Mastermind's death.{{issue|date=November 2014}}

Jason Wyngarde was a slight man with matted grey hair. He frequently used his illusory abilities to assume the appearance of a younger, more handsome man. In his favorite disguise, he sported [[Victorian era]] style whiskers.

==The Daughters of Mastermind==
Mastermind's name and powers still live on through his daughters: [[Mastermind (Martinique Jason)|Martinique Jason]] and [[Lady Mastermind|Regan Wyngarde]]. Both appear to be stronger than the original Mastermind; Martinique can create citywide illusions that even hypnotize people to believe they are in a whole new era and Regan's lethal illusions can continue even after she has been rendered unconscious.{{issue|date=August 2014}}

The X-Man [[Pixie (X-Men)|Pixie]]'s mother teleports herself to the Wyngarde Mansion, where Regan and Martinique are fighting one another. Pixie's mother claims Pixie is their sister, revealing Jason is her father.<ref>''X-Men: Pixie Strikes Back'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>
