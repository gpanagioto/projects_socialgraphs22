Kids, everyone together. Welcome to Pioneer Village. This is a recreation of early Colorado days. I want you all to meet Pioneer Paul.  Thank you, Pioneer Paul.  Eric, partner with Butters. Hold Butters' hand, Eric!  Butters, you are not to let go of Eric's hand until you are both back on that bus! Do you understand?! All right, let's head in.  All right kids, go ahead and visit the charming villagers and learn stuff.  Keep track of your partner! Please, if you must take anyone, don't take me. These kids are worth more to you.  Not me! Not me not me not me not me!  No, you got your door code, let us go! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
