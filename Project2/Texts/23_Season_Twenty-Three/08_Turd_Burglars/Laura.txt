Sheila? My goodness, look at you. Ah, I thought you were sick. Well, that certainly is... interesting. How was your salmon, Sheila? Well, thing is, we asked our doctors about getting fecal transplants too, and they said they only do them for "medical reasons," so we have to do them on our own. If it doesn't feel right, then it probably isn't right.  How much of a bitch can you be? Won't share your feces? Talk about anal-retentive! No. I think it's new, isn't it? Oh my God. Harriet? You look great! What happened? Two-faced bitch! You know what she said about you at lunch? Oh no! Clearly she couldn't stand that you were the only one whose shit didn't stink. [chuckles] Oh, thanks, girlfriend. We've been working out and dieting, you know. Not cheating like that bitch Harriet. Oh. Gaw! [throws up, then shits herself] I hope we can all be besties again.
