 Yes, I was just trying to do my job as a food critic and they all ganged up on me and said I was fat. I was in the locker room. I was in my underwear and these kids walked by  I said you were perfect because you're really good at getting all your schoolwork done on time  so you'd probably do a really good job. I'm not a joke! I wanted someone smart and hard-working! There you are. You have my social media comments?  Mm-hm. Hm-oh, that's nice. Oh great. This is all the Twitter comments? Okay, nice. Oh ni- oh, very enthusiastic. This is so great!  Oh Kyle! You thought me having someone edit my social media would make me look stupid? You should see all the comments I'm getting. People are actually really stoked on me now. Butters!  What the hell is this? The last report you gave me has a comment that says "This picture of you burned my eyes, fatso!" What new people?  Dude, fuck Demi Lovato! She's fuckin' hot, she's not being fat-shamed! Butters, I want this fixed by tonight! You got that?! <poem><i>Everyone likes me and thinks I'm great in my safe spaaaace.</i></poem> <poem><i></i></poem> <poem><i>Bully-proof windows.</i></poem> <poem><i>People that support me.</i></poem> <poem><i>More people that support me.</i></poem> <poem><i>Bully-proof windows. </i></poem> <poem><i>What?
