Oh man, this is another rerun. Because I had an itch up my ass. When are they gonna make new ones? What's this? Enough! I know! Dude! Did you get 'em? Yep. Tomorrow night. Ah, I'm sorry, but the four of us can't help tomorrow night. No, dude, we really, really do. Huh? Yeah, he looks terrible. Uuuuhh. Phillip? That's not Phillip. Come on, guys, we're getting to the bottom of this.  'Scuse us. It's okay. We're the official presidents of the Terrance and Phillip fan club. You don't understand! We saved Terrance and Phillip's lives once. Man, this sucks! I don't think we're female groupies or random sluts. We're not quadruplets, Terrance. We snuck in that woman's spandex to get in here. But where's Phillip? Because, dude, it's Terrance and Phillip. What if we can get Phillip to agree to get back together. Will you do the Earth Day show for us? Oh no, dude. They're not together anymore, dude. But there's nothing we can do. Phillip is doing Shakespeare in Canada now. Jesus Tapdancing Christ, is this thing ever gonna end?   Phillip! Phillip! Our town in Colorado was chosen to host Earth Day this year and... we need a big act.  Ah, well, we were thinking how cool it would be if you and Terrance got back together for a reunion and- But we need you! He'll do it, dude. Two thousand dollars. Dude, you didn't tell him Terrance would be there. I'm sure they'll be here any minute. Oh my God! Ee yeah, you must have a lot of catching up to do. But let's rehearse first. Fine!   Okay. Okay, I think we lost them. Guys, we have no choice. We're gonna have to move away. Environmental activists don't use logic or reason. Go! Run run run!  Come on, Kenny, hurry up! They're back! It sure did.
