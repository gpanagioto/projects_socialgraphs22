I'm Charlotte.  Thanks, Butters. I'm sore-y I didn't know what ice cream was. Well that's what Canadians say to express remorse. Everything all right? So hey, I wanted to see if you wanted to come over to my house for dinner tomorrow. Ey, daddy! Why would we want to be here? I'm sore-y about my papa. He can be really emotional sometimes. It's okay. We just have to give them time. Oh.. so do you want to be here? Now? In Canada, we call a Slow Cosby ... love.  Oh look! ''[a meteorite zooms across the sky] ''A shooting star! In Canada, we say that's... good luck. I'll Skype you when I'm home, my love!  
That sounds terrible. Be careful, Butters. 
Butters, I'm sorry, but I told you not to Skype me anymore, right? I have to stand with my girlfriends. Who?! This is a time when women and girls have to stick together.
