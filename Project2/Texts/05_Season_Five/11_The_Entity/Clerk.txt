 Next?  Mmmokay, the 2:30 flight to Cheyenne has boarded. Looks like you didn't make it. Nnnyeah, no problem, though. We'll get you on the 7 a.m. flight tomorrow morning.  Would you like a window or an aisle seat? Mmokay, and have any of your personal items been out of your possession since you left? Okay, and bags have been with you at all times?  And here's your boarding pass for tomorrow morning.
