Barking vaginal belch. Bloody butt cough. How are we supposed to name our startup company if every name is already taken?! It... doesn't... quite roll off the tongue. Yeah, that's why we wanna have a startup company. What?! Tell us! Washington Redskins? What?! Wait. Guys, this, this doesn't seem legal. Yeah, I just... well I just thought our company name would be more like uh... or-original Yeah, but maybe we need a name that's more affirming, like, shows what we stand for. I'm just not sure this is the name people are gonna give money to. No way!  Guys, we need to talk to you. I really don't think we wanna be a company that ISIS looks up to. We should maybe issue a statement saying that we don't sanction them. People aren't gonna support our company if we dig in our heels and say we don't care about anything! That's the Catholic Church! That's the NFL! All right, I really don't want to have to do this, but... I'm not happy with the direction this company is taking. Maybe I'll start my own company. I don't want to! It's a stupid name!  Yeah. I guess... I guess everything is. It's so awesome, dude. Our company already has a hundred backers. And we still have 14 days to go! You okay, bro? Give it time, it'll grow on you. Because that sounds like we don't have anything, We've been through this already, Stan! Well whattaya mean? Oh. Well, I certainly don't want you to feel that "Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly on the Table" is holding you back.  Yeah. Good luck with yours.  What the hell is wrong? "Can't find the server" Kickstarter.  What?! No, I just can't get it to load. My company was on Kickstarter too! Why would I get rid of it?! He's right. We should do a merger. Yes we do! We have a sweet name.  I was wrong, Cartman. "Washington Redskins" is the perfect name. I think maybe I was jealous that I didn't come up with it. Whattaya say, Cartman?  And the idea is simple. You, the people, go out and raise all your own money, and give the Washington Redskins 5%. What the heck is that?  Change our name? When was that? Well what the hell do we do?
