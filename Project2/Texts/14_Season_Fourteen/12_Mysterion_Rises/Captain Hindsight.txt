 So you're the superheroes trying to blackmail me! I shoulda never mixed vodka and Jack Daniels. I shoulda just gone to bed last night!  Where are the pictures?! Give every copy of the pictures to me NOW!  You got pictures of me having sex with Courtney Love! Alright enough! What's going on?! It's not Courtney Love? No! What if I put down the gun and realize I shouldn't have?! NO! Because I could realize I shoulda killed you all! It doesn't matter.  As soon as something bad happens, I immediately know how it could have been avoided. I can't take it anymore! Well I don't want the power anymore, alright?! Wha-? What is your power?  What should I do?  Seriously, what should I do?  Hindsight's a bitch, isn't it?
