Kyle!  Kyle, wake up! You've gotta wake up, Kyle!   No! Help! We're trapped!  We've gotta get out of here! Come on guys, the day is wasting away. What would be something really cool we could do? I think there's a place just outside of town. I'll see if my uncle Jimbo will drop us off. Yeah.  Good. How are you? ...Shuttle? Uh that's okay. Thank God.  I think we're good.  Oh, really?? There could be a helicopter. Maybe one will fly overhead. Guys, guys, does it really matter whose idea it was?! Alright, look, we can make it, you guys. We can't panic. If the four of us don't zipline the tour will move faster. We are gonna make it out of here, okay? Oh no, could, could we skip lunch and keep going?  Hey ah, I'm so sorry, but we have an emergency. Our friend is really really sick. ...Yyyeah. Yeah, his, his cold sore is really bad, and uhh he's losing blood, so we've gotta go. Yea, please! You see guys? This is gonna be sweet after all. Kyle. Kyle? Kyle, come on, wake up! No, we're not leaving you here, Kyle!  You guys, you guys! Get up! Listen to me! There's a lake a hundred yards down that way! They've got a marina with boats just sitting there! We can take a boat, you guys! We can probably take it all the way back to Fairplay! Come on you guys! A boat all to ourselves? It'll be fun! What could possibly go wrong?!  ...Kenny? Kenny!   Stop it! It was me! My idea. Four days ago, I came across a brochure for ziplining.   I had no idea ziplining would be so boring. Thank you.
