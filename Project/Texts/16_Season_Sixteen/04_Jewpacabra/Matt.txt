Look at its trajectory. It heads directly to the right.  It's definitely something. I'm thinking a Sasquatch. So it's a baby Squatch? Jewpacabra? No it's impossible. Look at the zoomy in. If I drop image of a dog next to it...  That thing is way to big to be a dog. And check out the thermals coming off of it. That's right, Bobo. Whatever this thing is it's mean and angry as hell. I'll tell you one thing, kid, you're pretty brave. If it is a Jewpacabra, he's gonna be coming after you.  I told you! Bunny people must be a throwback to paleotardic times! Shoot it Bobo! Good shot, Bobo! I know. Let's go get a show about it on Animal Planet. Alright! Come on, let's go!
