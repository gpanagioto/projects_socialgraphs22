==Fictional character biography==

===Pre-''Crisis''===
Garfield Lynns was a down-and-out film [[special effect]]s expert whose plan to rob a theater by faking a fire was foiled by [[Batman]] and [[Robin (character)|Robin]]. As Lynns fled the scene, Batman mistook a distant firefly for Lynns' lit cigarette and gave chase in the wrong direction. Lynns saw this as a sign of fate and became the Firefly, a costumed criminal who utilized various lighting effects and [[optical illusion]]s during heists.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

===Post-''Crisis''===
Following ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''{{'}} reboot of the DC Universe, Firefly was re-imagined as a much darker and more violent character.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

After being taken away from their abusive parents, Garfield Lynns and his sister, Amanda, grew up at the St. Evangelina Home for Orphans. Unlike his relatively normal sister, Garfield was a problematic child whom nobody wanted to adopt. As an adult, Lynns became a pyrotechnics and special effects expert in the film industry but eventually fell victim to [[Gotham City]]'s severe poverty issues and turned to a life of crime as a result. While he initially only committed arson during his robberies as a hobby, Lynns' compulsion to start fires soon turned into a pyromaniacal obsession as a result of his abusive and troubled childhood; he believed that he could see visions in the flames he created.

Lynns then becomes a professional arsonist known as the "Firefly", and allies himself with fellow supervillain [[Killer Moth]] in an attempt to kill Batman and Robin. Their alliance falls apart, however, when Killer Moth realizes the full extent of Firefly's madness and feared for his own well-being. The two villains are then taken into custody. During the ''[[Batman: Knightfall]]'' storyline, Firefly escapes from [[Arkham Asylum]] and attempts to burn all of the places that he lacked the privilege to go to as a child.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last= Booker |editor1-first=M. Keith |title=Comics Through Time: A History of Icons, Idols, and Ideas |date=2014 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn= 9780313397516 |page=909}}</ref> After successfully destroying a pier and a theater, Firefly is stopped by Batman as he tries to scorch the Gotham Zoo.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |title=The Essential Batman Encyclopedia |date=2008 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn= 9780345501066 |pages=136–137}}</ref> In his next attempt to burn Gotham to the ground, Firefly is horribly scarred when an uncontrollable fire that he starts at a chemical factory causes it to explode; over 90 percent of his body is burned, so he designs a fireproof battle suit to protect himself from his own flames from this point on.<ref name="dc-ency" />

During the ''[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]'' story arc, Firefly is one of the inmates at [[Blackgate Penitentiary]] when it is taken over by [[Lock-Up (comics)|Lock-Up]]. When [[Nightwing]] is captured after trying to retake the prison from Lock-Up, Firefly attempts to kill him and wear his skin over his burned body.<ref>''Nightwing'' vol. 2 #35–39</ref>

During the ''[[DC One Million]]'' crisis, Firefly nearly burns down Gotham while infected with the [[Hourman (android)|Hourman]] virus, requiring Nightwing and Robin to work with the future Batman to stop him.

Firefly makes a short appearance in the ''[[Justice League of America]]'' story arc "Crisis of Conscience",<ref>''JLA'' #115–119</ref> fighting [[Catwoman]] in Gotham City over a diamond before Batman arrives. Although an epic battle between the [[Secret Society]] and the Justice League ensues, Firefly is knocked unconscious and remains that way during the entire battle. He makes another short appearance in the 2005 miniseries ''[[Villains United]]'' when the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]] attempts to escape the Society's grasp.

Firefly is among the numerous heroes and villains apparently murdered by the [[OMACs]] in the pages of DC's ''[[The OMAC Project]]'', although he later appears alive in ''[[Villains United|Villains United: Infinite Crisis Special]]'' and ''[[Gotham Underground]]''. Firefly appears with [[Mr. Freeze]] facing Batman (though Firefly is wearing the same uniform as the Firefly design of ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'').<ref>''[[Superman/Batman]] Annual'' #3</ref> He and Mr. Freeze are again shown as having worked together a month after the events of the Crisis, Batman working with a redeemed [[Harvey Dent]] to take them down before he takes his year of absence while leaving Dent to guard Gotham.

Following the ''[[Final Crisis]]'', Firefly was with [[Cheetah (character)|Cheetah]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains]] at the time when [[Genocide (comics)|Genocide]] was created. He was defeated by [[Wonder Woman]] alongside [[Shrapnel (DC Comics)|Shrapnel]], [[Phobia (comics)|Phobia]], and [[T. O. Morrow]].

Firefly is recruited by a new [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]] to be a part of a group of villains that are aiming to take over Gotham, but he follows his own agenda. Inspired by the chemicals that Black Mask used on him, Firefly inserts chips into Gothamites in order to make them burn.<ref>''Batman: Streets of Gotham'' #1</ref> Not long after the identity of the new Black Mask was revealed to be [[Jeremiah Arkhams|Jeremiah Arkham]], Firefly was arrested and put into Arkham Asylum. A short time later, Firefly is broken out of Arkham Asylum by [[Dick Grayson]], who has assumed the mantle of Batman, to assist him in gaining access to Sebastian Blackspell's closest friends. Batman (Dick) desires to know what Blackspell's true intentions are in regards to killing the [[Riddler]].

==Powers and abilities==
Following ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''{{'}} reboot of the DC Universe, Firefly's depiction was drastically altered from that of a mere criminal who utilized colored lights and optical illusions to that of a violent sociopath with intense [[pyromania]]. Even prior to becoming Firefly, Garfield Lynns was already an expert in [[pyrotechnics]] and [[explosive]]s with a thorough knowledge of flammable agents. After he is horribly scarred by a blaze at a chemical factory, Lynns [[Mechanical engineering|mechanically engineered]] an insulated, fireproof [[Powered exoskeleton|battle suit]] to protect himself. This specialized outfit is equipped with an extensive arsenal of fire-creating weapons, including a military-grade [[flamethrower]], various [[incendiary device]]s (such as [[grenade]]s, [[napalm]], and [[Smoke grenade|smoke bombs]]), and a sword-like blade of superheated plasma for close-ranged [[hand-to-hand combat]]. A [[High tech|high-tech]], winged [[jet pack]] is also mounted on the back of the armor to allow for high-speed flight.

==Other characters named Firefly==

Carson then goes on a robbery spree before being apprehended by Batman and [[Batwoman]].<ref>''Batman'' #126</ref>

In ''[[The New 52]]'' reboot, Carson is a former high school [[teacher]] who tries to incinerate everything that will separate him from his ex-girlfriend Cindy Cooke, though he is ultimately defeated by [[Nightwing]] and [[Batgirl]].<ref>''Nightwing'' vol. 3 Annual #1</ref>

In the ''[[DC Rebirth]]'' relaunch, Ted Carson and [[Killer Moth]] attempt to kill Batman to collect [[Two-Face]]'s multi-million dollar bounty.<ref>''All-Star Batman'' #1</ref> Carson is later seen as one of the many villains that Bane pummels in his quest to reach Batman at Arkham Asylum.<ref>''Batman'' (vol. 3) #19</ref> During the gang war between the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] and the [[Riddler]], Carson is shown siding with the Riddler's faction.<ref>''Batman'' (vol. 3) #26</ref>
