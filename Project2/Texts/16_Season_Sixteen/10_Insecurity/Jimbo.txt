How do you tell him? "Hey Gerald, Sorry, but the UPS man is bangin' your wife." It's really none of our business.  He's back!  I just came from Will Patterson's house! His mother got three packages from Amazon! And the UPS guy told her what he'd like to do to her! He casually dropped this on his way out!  Stay out of this, Gerald! Some men care about what their wives are doing!
