Officer Barbrady, let's pretend for one second that we had a competent law enforcer in this town: what would ''he'' do?  The press is here.  Youuu certainly made it up here quickly.  Really?? Mr. Director person, what exactly do you want to do? Shh. Are you sure this wouldn't make our little town look dangerous?  Weelll, in that case, I guess it's okay! My God, this is the worst storm I've ever seen. Buut, how do we decide ''"who"''? We're all going to die in this horrible place.   Yes, of course. Nobody gives a shit about Eric Roberts. Well, there's no going back now.  God save us. My God, what a harrowing tale of human drama this is. All of us doing what we must to survive. But- hhhow will we live with ourselves now?
