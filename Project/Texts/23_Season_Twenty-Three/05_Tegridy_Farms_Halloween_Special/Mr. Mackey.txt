Okay. An-and do you feel like maybe the mummy is trying to, you know, get you to react? Well, you know, Butters, the mummy feels like you get to do whatever you want, but it doesn't get to do whatever it wants. Yeah, yeah, we had a good talk, yeah. I think the mummy is very insightful and cares about you a lot. Look, the mummy's just sad because you get to go to school and have fun, and what does the mummy get to do? You know, it just sits around being a mummy. You know, that's not fair. Right, but you do care, Butters, because you're sitting in my office talking all about the bad things that the mummy does.
