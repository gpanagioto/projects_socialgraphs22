All right, you, it's time to go. Let's go. I don't tell you how to do your job, don't tell me how to do mine. 
Hey, there he is! That's Charlie Manson!  Come back here, God damnit!  Fudgecicle!   Tell him we ''won't'' shoot him, Boss. 1-Marshmallow, 2-Marshmallow,...  
 Ow! 
Hey you kids. What the hell do you think you're doin'? 
You sure you don't want to press charges? 
You boys! Trent is trying to tell us the fire was ''your'' idea. I thought so. All right, that's it, Trent. You're going to Juvenile Hall for a long time! 
So let me get this straight. That woman over there was trying to get to her balls which were in the knees of a black child whose father is a dolphin. Sounds like an open and shut case. All right, let's head 'em out!  
Stay back, people! 
Sir! More people in Beaverton are calling. They say they're trapped in floods and fire now. 
License and registration, please.  ...Sir, why don't you step out of the car for me? Sir, I'm going to give you a sobriety test. Stand over here, please?  And now touch your finger to your nose. Touch your finger to your nose. Just bring one hand to your nose, like this.  Keep blowing. Keep blowing.  Keep blowing.  Aw Jesus! What's goin' on here? ...I understand. My, my brother's an alcoholic. Here, let me push you to the front of the line.  
 All right, gig is up. Put down the gun! Drop the gun and step away.  
Did your son ''say'' anything before he disappeared, Mrs. Stotch? 
 You can explain all that downtown.  
It's not just the press. Everyone agrees. She ''must''... die. 
Sir, we might wanna get a unit down to the Italian restaurant on Kentner. Call just came through. Seems a penis broke in and tried to eat their cheese. 
The President? 
Code word is "stretch," copy? 
Wait. Look! Up in the sky! Thank youuu! 
Up in the Yukon. All bureaus are confirming it. 
If you're stting on the toilet you need to wear your safety belt, sir. The address here is 260 Avenue de los Mexicanos? Gotta wear your safety belt or you could fall in. The law is the law sir.   You say something? 
Sir, we found this in the closet upstairs?  
Can I help you with anything? Okay, were you with a cruise ship or land tour group? 
Sir, there's a kid over at the hospital saying he saw everything. 
Hello, sir, we're conducting an investigation. 
Detective, look! 
People were attacked by an ancient Egyptian mummy. It killed five people and destroyed everything it could. Is it true, sir, that you and the mummy  "got into an argument over a gift you didn't seem to appreciate"? Did you throw the mummy out of your house? Well that's what the mummy told us about you. Calm down, sir! I can't understand you! 
Alright. Take this shithead to the station and book him for sexual assault of a minor.  We got some more St. Patrick's Day offenders. Let's go, buddy.  Okay, back in you go.   He just touched me and he didn't ask for consent or anything. I just need to take a shower and cry. Oh my God. Can I help you? Alright, it's your lucky day, folks, some kids brought you some holiday cheer. Hey guys! How'd you like to be able to celebrate a little?!  Ooh da lolly! St. Patrick's Day! Wow, look at it! I thought I wouldn't be able to get wasted till later! Man, that is strong ass shit. You can taste the Irishness.  This weed is amazing and it has so much cred. You know, I've never really been a fan of the holiday Specials, but this one is really good.  There he is, get him!
