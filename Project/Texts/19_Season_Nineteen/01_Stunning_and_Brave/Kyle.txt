You know what? I think it's good. Let's face it: this is long overdue. Good! He should be sad and scared! These things do matter and I already feel better to be at a school where we can start to have a dialogue and talk about this stuff. Uhhh, hey Cartman. Uhwaht's goin' on? Aren't you going to ah, you know, go do something about this new principal? Yeah, where is the Eric Cartman we know? The Eric Cartman we know breaks the rules. And he gets away with it. Just like his hero! Come on, who's your hero, Cartman?!  You're Tom Brady, Cartman! And that new principal in there is the football commissioner trying to dictate his punishment to you. And what happens when an invulnerable cheater comes up against an elitist corporate dictator? Cool. I think we did it.  Dude, if we all tell the police what the principal did, he'll be fired! Why? No, you're a bigot. I'm not going to apologize for saying Caitlyn Jenner isn't a hero! In fact, personally, I think she's most likely not a very good person!  Come on, fat-ass. So you're never gonna call me a dirty Jew again? Oh fuck you.  AAAAHH! What the fuck, dude?! What the fuck?!  Will you please tell your dad to leave me alone?  I didn't even say she wasn't a hero! I just said she isn't a hero to me! I didn't like Bruce Jenner as a person when he was on the Kardashians, and I don't suddenly like him now! HER, yes! Enough! Stop! Everyone STOHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHP!  It just seems to me like we all lost in this, and that the only person who won was you.
