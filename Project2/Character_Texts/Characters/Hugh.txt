All right, everyone. I realize a lot of people have died and most of the roads have been destroyed due to all the fires, so I'd like to thank you all for coming to tonight's symposium, "When Should I Start To Worry?"  I'd like to make this an open discussion and hope we can all participate in ways that give us better insight. Yes, Mr. Clarkson? That's an excellent question. There's definitely evidence that all the death and destruction around us is due to a ManBearPig. Definitely not, and that's why we're all here, to pinpoint, "When Should I Start To Worry?" I think Stephen echoes a lot of our feelings right now. And now, on Park County Public access, "Should We Start To Worry?" with your host, Jim Kimble.
