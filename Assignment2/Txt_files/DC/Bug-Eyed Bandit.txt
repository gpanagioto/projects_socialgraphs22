== Fictional character biography ==

=== Bertram Larvan ===
'''Bertram Larvan''' was an inventor who designed a mechanical insect to control insect pests. Unfortunately, he had no financial backing to support his invention. He resolved to steal money he needed for his invention. He later used his invention to steal more. Soon, he had an army of mechanical insects. Two of his many insects were stag beetles who could bite through steel and spiders with webs that could support the weight of a man. Bertram took the name of the '''Bug-Eyed Bandit'''. He was thwarted by the [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Atom]].<ref>''The Atom'' #26 (August–September 1966)</ref>

Later, he accidentally discovered the Atom's identity of Ray Palmer and fought him on different occasions. When he was about to use an amnesiac gas he had invented on Atom, he accidentally uses it on himself. He remains in a state of amnesia for years. During the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', millions of Shadow Demons, servants of the [[Anti-Monitor]], attack the Earth. Bertram is one of the many casualties.<ref>''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' (1985)</ref> Marv Wolfman has gone on record saying that he killed both the original Bug-Eyed Bandit and the [[Ten-Eyed Man]] because he “couldn’t be part of a company that would print [them]".

In Grant Morrison's ''[[Animal Man (comic book)|Animal Man]]'' storyline "Deus Ex Machina", [[Psycho-Pirate]], while in [[Arkham Asylum]], recreated characters removed from continuity. The Bug-Eyed Bandit (or a Pre-''Crisis'' version of him) was one of them. Presumably, this character vanished from existence when the Psycho-Pirate's episode of madness ended, along with his colleagues.<ref>''Animal Man'' #18-26 (1989–1990)</ref>

A flashback concerning his death happens in '' Batman Villains Secret Files and Origins 2005''.

Bertram Larvan has been identified as one of the deceased entombed below the Hall of Justice. He is revived as a member of the [[Black Lantern Corps]].<ref>''Blackest Night'' #4 (2010)</ref>

The second Bug-Eyed Bandit is first presented as such in ''[[Adventures of Superman (comic book)|Adventures of Superman]]''.<ref>''[[Adventures of Superman (comic book)|Adventures of Superman]]'' #608 (November 2002)</ref> But his first appearances can be traced as far back as ''[[Justice League America]]'' #43 (1990), where a Bug-Eyed Bandit appeared even though the original was supposed to be dead at the time. The current one is the son of the original Bug-Eyed Bandit, but not very successful.

Bug-Eyed Bandit recently reappeared in ''[[Villains United]]'' and ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' as a member of [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Society]]. His current whereabouts are unknown.

She almost kills her employer, [[Tina McGee]], but Larvan is defeated by the combined efforts of [[Ray Palmer (Arrowverse)|Ray Palmer]], the [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|Flash]], and [[Felicity Smoak (Arrowverse)|Felicity Smoak]]. Larvan later appears in the ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' episode "Beacon of Hope". Imprisoned in [[Iron Heights Penitentiary|Iron Heights]] following the events of "All Star Team Up", Brie uses her court-sanctioned computer time to change her prison release date so she can get out early. Having been diagnosed with a spinal tumor that will render her paraplegic once it is removed, she takes Palmer Technologies' board members hostage using upgraded robotic bees to force Smoak to give her schematics for the prototype microchip that allowed the formerly paralyzed Smoak to walk. The [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Green Arrow]] and his team try to rescue the hostages, but one of the drones lodges itself inside his body and begins replicating, threatening to release dozens more. Palmer Tech employee [[Curtis Holt (Arrowverse)|Curtis Holt]] helps Team Arrow successfully destroy the mini-swarm before devising a method to hack Larvan's remaining bees, commanding them to sting her. The overdose of apitoxin leaves Brie in a coma as she is taken by the police and put in Starling General Hospital to be treated.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/recap/arrow-season-4-episode-17|title='Arrow' recap: Star City is abuzz with a returning threat|website=Entertainment Weekly's EW.com|access-date=2016-04-03}}</ref> In the ''Flash'' episode "Gone Rogue", Larvan, having come out of her coma, is given [[Spencer Young]]'s meta-tech cellphone to control her robotic bees, and joins forces with [[Rag Doll (Arrowverse)|Rag Doll]], the [[Joslyn Jackam|Weather Witch]], and [[Nora West-Allen|XS]] for a heist at [[Eva McCulloch|McCulloch Technologies]].
