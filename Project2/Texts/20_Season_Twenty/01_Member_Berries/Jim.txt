Hello everyone and welcome back. We are live at South Park Elementary School where the local girl's volleyball team is about to take on the Jefferson Sabers.  Might be totally unexpected. All eyes were on Nichole when Heidi Turner comes out of nowhere and sits down. And, as the anthem draws to a close, this thing is over. And Mike, this new anthem is said to have everything the old one had but, some new surprises as well. You'd have to be an absolute asshole not to stand and support it. And the Anthem begins, let's hope this fixes America. Ohhh! And J.J. Abrams has absolutely shattered expectations, Mike! Now whether people are standing, sitting, or kneeling, they are all honoring America. J.J. Abrams is a wizard, Tom. A wizard.  And there's the rest of the Anthem, all the parts we remembered and loved. J.J. Abrams has fixed America.
