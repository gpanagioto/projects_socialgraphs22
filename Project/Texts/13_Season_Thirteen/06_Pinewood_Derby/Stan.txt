Dad, we're not allowed to add anything to the car that doesn't come in the approved kit, remember? What is that?  Oh no, he didn't. Tells? Dad, maybe we should just take out the thing you put in the car an- It's uh, Marsh.   Yes I do. Yeah? Aw crap, Dad!  Alien? What does it want? Dad they aren't here for that.  Dad. Dad, you know we can't make the car go as fast as before with only the approved Pinewood Derby kit.  Well we have to tell them we used something outside the kit. Come on, Dad. We've gotta come clean. Dad, it's over. We have to tell everyone we cheated.  Kill the alien? No. Dad, we don't even know what'll happen. Dad?  I guess so. It just still doesn't feel right. No, Dad- Whoawhoawhoa Dad, what are we doing? 'Scuse me! 'Scuse me!  The truth is, I don't deserve this trophy. 'Cause I cheated on my Pinewood Derby car. I used something not in the approved kit.  This trophy isn't mine, and so I have to give it back! Because if I'm not honest now, then I'll have to keep this lie going forever. And it will just grow and grow.
