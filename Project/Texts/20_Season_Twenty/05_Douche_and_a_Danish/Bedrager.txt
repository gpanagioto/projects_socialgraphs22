 Hello. Are you tired of hate speech? Are you sick of sexism and-a bigotry? Then please, help the Danish put an end to trolls. Right now, the people of Denmark are working on a biometric computer superstructure which will allow people all around the world to identify the trolls in their communities. But to make this dream into a reality, we still need your donations. We are just a few million kroners away, so please donate via the social media of your choice. Just imagine it, knowing who said what on the Internet.
