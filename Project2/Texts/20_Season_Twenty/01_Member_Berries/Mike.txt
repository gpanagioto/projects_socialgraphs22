And, hey Jim, it is packed. Sellout crowds tonight, first time in team history. Everyone turning out to see what's going to happen. This week with athletes all over the country sitting down for the National Anthem,  the question on everyone's mind is "What is this little girl gonna do?" The National Anthem starts. Nichole Daniels seems to be waiting. So far no si... Oh!  And Heidi Turner is sitting down!  And there goes Meghan Ridley! The crowd is going wild. What a turn of events! Let's check in with Dave. Complete surprise, Dave. Nobody saw this coming. Three girls now sitting down and finally, there goes Nichole. The final result, four athletes sitting out of the National Anthem, three of them not even black. A shocker here in South Park, thanks for joining us.  Hello everyone, we are live at tonight's game between the '49ers and the Panthers, but of course what everyone is really here for, the unveiling of the new National Anthem rebooted by J.J. Abrams. This is such a big night for America that both Presidential candidates are here.  And there's the Giant Douche doing the same. More people sitting now as Abrams has made it irrelevant. Who saw this coming?
