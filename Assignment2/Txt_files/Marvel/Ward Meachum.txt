==Fictional character biography==
Ward Meachum is the brother of [[Harold Meachum]], the CEO of Rand-Meachum Inc.<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #19</ref> After [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] was blamed for the death of Harold (who was killed by a ninja sent by [[Master Khan]]), Ward and his niece, Joy Meachum, hired villains to kill him.<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #21</ref>

Ward first hired [[Steel Serpent]] to get revenge on Iron Fist.<ref>''Iron Fist'' #1</ref> Due to Ward's own criminal connections, Steel Serpent stated that he couldn't work for him. After beating up Ward's bodyguards and leaving Ward alive, Steel Serpent explained that his debt to Joy had been paid and that he would take revenge on Iron Fist by himself.<ref>''Iron Fist'' #13</ref>

Ward then began to collaborate with Master Khan. Master Khan sent his minion, Ferocia, to help Ward.<ref>''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #97</ref> Afterward, Ward enlisted [[Shades (comics)|Shades]] and [[Comanche (comics)|Comanche]], giving Shades a laser-shooting visor and Comanche a set of trick arrows to take down [[Luke Cage|Power Man]] and Iron Fist.<ref>''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #98</ref> Upon obtaining the Power Gem of Quon, Ward and his men placed the Power Gem on a pedestal, using it to bring Master Khan back to Earth.<ref>''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #99</ref> Master Khan then told Ward about the Power Gem of Quon's ability to take away [[Shou-Lao]]'s powers from Iron Fist, which would give Khan's dragons the power to kill Iron Fist. Master Khan was forced to fight Iron Fist when the [[Heroes for Hire]] attack. Iron Fist was able to destroy the Power Gem of Quon to send Master Khan back to K'un-L'un, and Ward and his men were arrested after the battle.<ref>''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #100</ref>

After Joy learned the truth about what happened to her father, Ward Meachum collaborated with [[Super-Skrull]] to take over Earth in exchange for Ward winning the hand of the "most beautiful woman in the galaxy".<ref>''Namor the Sub-Mariner'' #16</ref> Ward was informed by an Oracle Inc. worker and Phoebe Marrs that Super-Skrull's offer would be horrible to Ward.<ref>''Namor the Sub-Mariner'' #17</ref> Due to the paranoia he developed from Phoebe's warning, Ward turned against the [[Skrull]]s by sabotaging the machine. This resulted in Super-Skrull using his pyrokinesis to kill Ward.<ref>''Namor the Sub-Mariner'' #18</ref>
