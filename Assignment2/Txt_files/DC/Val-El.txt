'''Jor-El''', originally known as '''Jor-L''', is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. Created by writer [[Jerry Siegel]] and artist [[Joe Shuster]], Jor-El first appeared in a newspaper comic strip in 1939 with [[Superman]].

Jor-El is Superman's biological father, the husband of [[Lara (comics)|Lara]], and a leading scientist on the planet [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]] before its destruction. He foresees his planet's fate but is unable to convince his colleagues in time to rescue most of Krypton's inhabitants. Jor-El is able to save his infant son Kal-El ([[Superman]]) by launching him towards Earth in a homemade spaceship just moments before Krypton explodes. When Superman later constructs his headquarters, the [[Fortress of Solitude]], he honors his biological parents with the inclusion of a statue of Jor-El and Lara holding up a globe of Krypton, the fortress also holds a holographic copy of Jor-El's consciousnesses, letting Superman able to interact with his father for advice and his knowledge. Most renditions of Jor-El show him with a strong resemblance to Superman due to being father and son.

Jor-El was portrayed by [[Marlon Brando]] in the films ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'', ''[[Superman II]]'' and ''[[Superman Returns]]''. This character was portrayed by [[Russell Crowe]] in the film ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]''. [[Angus Macfadyen]] portrayed the character in the first season of the television series ''[[Superman & Lois]]''.

== Fictional character biography ==
=== Precursor (''New Adventure Comics'') ===
Joe Shuster and Jerry Siegel, the creators of both Superman and Jor-L, first introduced a character named "Jor-L" in 1936, more than a year before the first Superman story was published.<ref name=urbanlegend>{{cite web |url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2008/10/16/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-177/ |title=Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #177 |last1=Cronin |first1=Brian |date= 16 October 2008|website=Comics Should Be Good |publisher= [[Comic Book Resources]]|access-date=3 September 2013}}</ref><ref name=newadventure>{{cite comic|writer= [[Jerry Siegel]]|penciller= [[Joe Shuster]]|story= Federal Men|title= New Adventure Comics|issue= 12|date= January 1937}}</ref> The original "Jor-L" appeared in ''New Adventure Comics'' (released in 1936, [[Cover date|cover-dated]] January 1937), a re-titled issue #12 of the previous ''New Comics'', which would be re-titled again, starting with issue #32, as the 45-year-long ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' series.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=McAvennie |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |title=DC Comics Year By Year: A Visual Chronicle |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-8578-6 |page=16}}</ref>

Featured in the four-page Shuster and Siegel strip ''Federal Men'', this "Jor-L" is not an [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] but, instead, a far-future "ace [[detective|sleuth]]" in the service of "Interplanetary Federation Headquarters". The character battles "Nira-Q", the outer-space-faring "bandit queen", in the year [[3000 A.D.]] The 1936 "Jor-L" exists as part of a [[story within a story]], as Shuster and Siegel's strip presents the tale as a scientist's forecast of future crime-fighting told to the contemporary 1930s-era [[G-Man (slang)|G-man]] heroes of "Federal Men".<ref name="urbanlegend" /><ref name="newadventure" />

=== "Golden Age" and "Silver Age" versions ===
Jor-El was first referred to indirectly in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #1 in 1938, which only mentioned a scientist who sends his son to Earth. He made his first full-fledged appearance in [[Superman (comic strip)|the ''Superman'' newspaper comic strip]] in 1939, where his name was spelled as "Jor-L". His name first appeared as being spelled "Jor-el" in the ''Superman'' novel ''The Adventures of Superman'' (1942) written by [[George Lowther (writer)|George Lowther]]. Later comic books capitalized the "E" in "El." Jor-El's first appearance in a comic book was in ''[[More Fun Comics]]'' #101.

In the 1960s, now known as part of the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], [[DC Comics]] introduced to its superhero stories the fictional concept of different versions of characters from real-world publication history existing [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|in separate "universes"]] that could communicate with each other.<ref>{{cite book|last=McAvennie|first= Michael|editor-last = Dolan|editor-first = Hannah|chapter= 1960s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 103 |quote = This classic Silver Age story [''[[Flash of Two Worlds]]''] resurrected the Golden Age Flash and provided a foundation for the Multiverse from which he and the Silver Age Flash would hail.}}</ref><ref>''[[Flash of Two Worlds]]'' (''The Flash'' #123)</ref> As DC developed this concept through further stories, the version of Superman's father during the previous [[Golden Age of Comic Books]] was identified as "Jor-''L''", matching the original spelling of the character's name, who lived on the Krypton of the [[Earth-Two]] "[[fictional universe|universe]]" (derived from the versions of characters and stories that appeared during the earlier "Golden Age" period of publication history). In contrast, the concept presented "Jor-''El''" as no longer another spelling of the same name but a different character entirely: the father of the then-contemporary "Silver Age" version of Superman, who lived on the Krypton of the [[Earth-One]] "universe" (used to describe the setting for then-current "Silver Age" stories and characters, some of which had been substantially changed from their "Golden Age" versions).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |last2=Pasko |first2=Martin |title=The Essential Superman Encyclopedia |date=2010 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=978-0-345-50108-0 |pages=136–139}}</ref>

A retelling of Superman's [[origin story]] in 1948 first delved into detail about Jor-El. However, his formal and more familiar Silver Age aspects were firmly established starting in the late 1950s. Over the course of the next several decades, there was a definitive summarization in the miniseries ''[[World of Krypton]]'' in [[1979 in comics|1979]] (not to be confused with the similarly-named post-''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' late-[[1980s in comics|1980s]] comic miniseries).

==== His accomplishments ====
As presented in the ''World of Krypton'' miniseries and other stories from the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], Jor-El was Krypton's leading scientist, inventing, among other devices, the "Jor-El," a [[hovercar]]. He also discovered a parallel plane of existence which he called the [[Phantom Zone]] and invented a device by which it could be entered, which he called the Phantom Zone Projector. This device got him a seat on the Science Council, Krypton's ruling body. He lived in Krypton's major city of [[Kryptonopolis]].

Even before Jor-El's birth, the El family was renowned across Krypton for its various contributions to Kryptonian society. Ancestors of Jor-El included Val-El, a famous [[exploration|explorer]]; Sul-El, the inventor of Krypton's first [[telescope]]; Tala-El, the author of Krypton's first planetary [[constitution]]; Hatu-El, the inventor of Krypton's first [[electromagnet]] and first electric motor; and Gam-El, the father of modern Kryptonian [[architecture]].

==== Family life ====
[[File:Superman S symbol.svg|thumb|[[Family]] [[emblem]] of the [[House of El]], the popular logo of his son, Kal-El]]
Jor-El had two brothers: [[Zor-El]], who lived in [[Argo City]] and eventually became the father of Kara, alias [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]], and an identical [[twin]] brother named [[Nim-El]], who lived in [[Kandor (comics)|Kandor]]. In several stories, Jor-El's father was established as Jor-El I, and his mother as Nimda ([[Née|nee]] An-Dor).{{citation-needed|date=July 2021}} Jor-El eventually met and married Lara, the daughter of Lor-Van and a young [[astronaut]] in Krypton's fledgling space program (which was soon permanently grounded after [[Jax-Ur]] blew up one of Krypton's inhabited moons, leading to eternal banishment to the Phantom Zone);<ref>''Superman'' #233 (January 1971). DC Comics.</ref> the two had an infant son, [[Kal-El]].

==== Jor-El's warnings of Krypton's doom ====
When Krypton began experiencing a series of [[earthquake]]s, Jor-El investigated. He soon discovered, to his horror, that Krypton's core was extremely unstable and indeed radioactive, and worse, that it would eventually reach [[critical mass]] and explode, taking the entire planet and its populace with it.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fleisher |first1=Michael L. |title=The Original Encyclopedia of Comic Book Heroes, Volume Three: Superman |date=2007 |publisher=DC Comics |isbn=978-1-4012-1389-3 |pages=97–105}}</ref> Jor-El tried to convince the members of the Science Council of this impending disaster and urged re-establishing Krypton's space program so giant spacecraft could be built to carry the populace to another habitable world. However, the Council was dismissive of Jor-El's findings and refused to comply with his plan. Some even accused him of treachery, trying to cause chaos so he could take over. This had been a plot of [[General Zod]]'s, which having failed, caused his banishment to the Phantom Zone. Thus the Council was wary of Jor-El's motives.

Around the time he discovered his homeworld's impending doom, Jor-El met his own son Kal-El without realizing it (Kal-El had accidentally travelled back in time). There were supporters of Jor-El's theory, but when a ship was constructed to evacuate them, the city of Kandor was shrunken and stolen by [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]], removing the people who believed in Jor-El's work.<ref>''Superman'' #141 (November 1960). DC Comics.</ref>

Frustrated, Jor-El continued his work on space travel on his own, hoping to build a spacecraft to save his own family. This work included launching several smaller test rockets; one of these rockets included the family [[dog]], who responded to the name of "[[Krypto (comics)|Krypto]]."<ref>''Adventure Comics'' #210 (March 1955). DC Comics.</ref> However, as time ran short, Jor-El soon found that he would only have enough time to build a spacecraft to save his son Kal-El. He decided to send Kal-El to Earth, realizing he would gain superhuman powers under Earth's more intense yellow [[sun]] and lower [[gravitation|gravity]]. As Krypton finally went through its final destructive stages, Jor-El and Lara placed their son in the rocket and launched him toward Earth, before they themselves were killed along with almost all the rest of the planet's population. Lara could have fit inside the rocket as well, but she chose to stay behind to increase Kal-El's chances of reaching Earth.

=== Post-''Crisis'' ===
After the [[1985 in comics|1985]]-[[1986 in comics|1986]] [[Limited series (comics)|miniseries]] ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]'s 1986 miniseries ''[[The Man of Steel (comics)|The Man of Steel]]'' rewrote [[Superman]]'s origins, details about Jor-El's background and character were changed. In Byrne's version, Jor-El inhabited a cold and emotionally sterile Krypton where even bodily contact was forbidden. Indeed, Jor-El himself was considered a "throwback" for actually expressing [[emotion]]s toward his mate [[Lara (comics)|Lara]] and favoring the less sterilized days of past Kryptonian eras. Another change in this version was Jor-El genetically altering his son's [[fetus]] (gestating in a "birthing matrix") to allow him to leave Krypton (in this version of the mythos, Kryptonians were genetically "bonded" to the planet itself, not allowing them to leave) and merely attaching a [[warp engine]] to the matrix instead of constructing a ship wholesale. The result was that Kal-El was "born" when the birthing matrix opened on Earth.

In the [[1990s in comics|1990s]] series ''[[Starman (comics)|Starman]]'' Jor-El meets a time-traveling [[Starman (Jack Knight)|Jack Knight]] and [[Mikaal Tomas]], two individuals who both bore at various points the name "Starman", and had been accidentally sent 70 years back in time and hurled across space. Jor-El thereby first learns of Earth's existence; in return, Jor-El helps Knight and Tomas escape from his overbearing father [[Seyg-El]].

In the [[2004 in comics|2004]] miniseries ''[[Superman: Birthright]]'', Jor-El, along with Krypton and Lara, was, more or less, reinstated to his Silver Age versions, though with such updated touches as Lara contributing equally to the effort of sending Kal-El, once again an infant while on Krypton, to Earth. In this version, Jor-El discovers Earth moments before launching his son's spacecraft. Also, the conclusion of the miniseries has the adult Superman, on Earth, seeing his parents through [[Lex Luthor]]'s time-space communicator, and on Krypton, seconds before its destruction, Jor-El and Lara see their son alive and well on Earth and know that their efforts were successful. As with Byrne's conflicting view of Krypton, the ''Birthright'' origins of Jor-El, Krypton, and Luthor have recently been [[retroactive continuity|retconned]], and, following ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', they are no longer valid in comics [[canon (fiction)|canon]].

However, a more recent storyline co-written by [[Geoff Johns]] and ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' director [[Richard Donner]] presented yet another version of Jor-El and Krypton which reintroduced [[General Zod]] and the Phantom Zone criminals. With art by [[Adam Kubert]], Jor-El is depicted for the first time with a [[beard]] and the design of Kryptonian society is distinct yet again from ''Birthright'' and ''Man of Steel'', incorporating elements of Donner's work on the first two [[Christopher Reeve]] films, in particular the notion of Krypton's Council threatening Jor-El with harsh penalty of exile to the very Phantom Zone he himself had discovered if he were to make public his predictions of their planet's imminent doom or otherwise attempt to "create a climate of panic."

Jor-El is shown here to have been mentored by friend and noted scientist [[Non (DC Comics)|Non]], who corroborated Jor-El's findings regarding Krypton's impending destruction, when the two were arrested and brought to trial before the Council by Zod and [[Ursa (comics)|Ursa]]. When Non defies the Council's dire prohibitions and elects to spread the word of the coming apocalypse, he is abducted by Council agents and apparently [[lobotomy|lobotomized]], thus explaining the character's mute simple-mindedness, brutality and destructiveness in line with [[Jack O'Halloran]]'s performance as Non in the first two Reeve films. Appalled, Zod and Ursa propose to Jor-El that they band together and overthrow the Council, but Jor-El will have none of it. When their murderous insurrection fails, the Council forces Jor-El to exile them to the Phantom Zone and never speak of his findings again, lest he face the same fate. For this perceived betrayal, Zod declares that he will escape and conquer Krypton (confident that Jor-El will actually discover some way to save the planet) and force the scientist and his son to kneel before him one day.

Having been re-built via a Kryptonian crystal during the ''[[One Year Later]]'' story arc, the current version of the Fortress of Solitude, which was also designed to essentially be visually identical to the Donner and [[Bryan Singer]] films, now contains an advanced interactive "recording" of Jor-El which, although visually dissimilar to [[Marlon Brando]], is otherwise identical in function to that featured in ''[[Superman Returns]]''.

''[[Superman/Batman]]'' #50 presents Jor-El sending a probe to Earth that makes contact with [[Thomas Wayne]] while he is on a drive with a pregnant [[Martha Wayne|Martha]], the probe [[holography|holographically]] transmitting Thomas' consciousness to Krypton so that Jor-El could better learn what kind of world Earth was to help him decide which of many possible candidates he should send his son to. Thomas tells Jor-El that the people of Earth aren't perfect, but are essentially a good and kind race who would raise the child right, convincing Jor-El to send Kal-El there. Thomas recorded his encounter in a diary, which was discovered by his son [[Bruce Wayne]] in the present day.

Following two line-wide revisions of DC superhero comic books, branded by DC Comics as “[[New 52]]” and “[[DC Rebirth]]”, the character Jor-El was revised to be still alive within the books’ fictional setting. The 2017-19 miniseries ''[[Doomsday Clock (comics)|Doomsday Clock]]'' presented his survival as the act of [[Doctor Manhattan]], who whisked Jor-El away as Krypton crumbled and taken to Earth, where he crashed in a war-torn nation. After being nursed back to health by locals (his own superpowers developing in a delayed manner as he was hidden in a basement away from sunlight), Jor-El saw firsthand the atrocities of man, as a dictator usurped all of what the people owned, causing them to starve. After witnessing these atrocities, Jor-El is forced to watch the horrors of mankind over the centuries and is represented as '''Mister Oz''', who had been monitoring Superman since his pre-"Flashpoint" counterpart appeared during storylines of "The New 52", a line-wide revision of DC superhero comic books.<ref>''Action Comics'' #987. DC Comics (Burbank, California).</ref> Jor-El becomes dissatisfied with humanity and attempts to force his son and his family to leave in the believe that Earth cannot be saved, but when Superman forces him to acknowledge that he is attacking his own son, he withdraws. It is later established that Jor-El was a member of the "Circle", a clandestine organization composed of five powerful cosmic beings and intergalactic rulers including [[Appa Ali Apsa]], [[Sardath]] of [[Rann (fictional planet)|Rann]] and the being who destroyed Krypton named Rogol Zaar.<ref>''The Man of Steel'' (vol. 2) #1.

==Other versions==
===''Elseworlds''===
In the ''[[Elseworlds]]'' series ''[[Superman: The Last Family of Krypton]]'', Jor-El is able to save himself and Lara and accompany Kal-El to Earth, where Jor-El sets up the corporation JorCorp while Lara establishes the self-help movement Raology. 

===''Superman Adventures''===
In ''Superman Adventures'' (based on the animated series), the story arc "Family Reunion" sees Superman accidentally travel to a parallel universe where a single Kryptonian city survived Krypton's destruction, with its natives including Jor-El and Lara. Unfortunately, this version of Lara has been driven insane by Krypton's destruction, and plans to lead the city in the conquest of Earth, to the extent that she has already brainwashed the "local" Superman and Supergirl after killing the Kents. Jor-El and the displaced Superman are able to rally Superman's foes, such as Luthor and Metallo, to force Lara's forces back to the city, at which point Jor-El sacrifices himself to destroy the city and the rest of his people to generate a powerful explosion that will send Superman back to his home reality.<ref>''Superman Adventures'' #30-31.

== In other media ==
Jor-El has appeared (usually briefly) in various media adaptations of the Superman story.

In the story, Superman has an induced fantasy where he sees what his life would be like if Krypton had not exploded. Here, Jor-El is portrayed as an old man whose "sky-is-falling" theories disgraced him, but has done well enough for himself since then to have a sense of humor about it. As a bit of an [[in-joke]], his facial design matches Superman's from the first season of ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]''. Superman later hears Jonathan Kent's voice as a sign of Superman realizing the truth about the fantasy.
* Though Jor-El does not appear in person, he is referenced by an older Superman in the ''[[Batman Beyond]]'' two-parter "The Call." The producers have claimed that Superman's original voice actor, [[Tim Daly]], was available at the time of production, but they opted to cast McDonald to strengthen the father-son connection between Jor-El and Superman.
* The Silver Age versions of Jor-El and Lara appear in the ''Pinky and the Brain'' episode "Two Mice and a Baby," voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]. They place an infant Kal-El in his ship as Krypton crumbles.<ref>"[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0954798/ Two Mice and a Baby]", ''Pinky and the Brain'', The WB</ref>
* Jor-El also appears in the ''[[Legion of Super Heroes (TV series)|Legion of Super Heroes]]'' animated series. He appears in the episode called "Message in a Bottle." In that episode, he was shown in a flashback, which was a story told by [[Brainiac 5]], referring to the time when [[Brainiac (character)|the original Brainiac (known as Brainiac 1.0 by the 31st century)]] shrank Kandor and destroyed the entire planet Krypton.
* Jor-El is also featured in the animated web series ''Kara and the Chronicles of Krypton'', a spin-off of the television series ''[[Smallville]]''.
* Jor-El is featured in ''[[The Looney Tunes Show]]'' episode "Best Friends", voiced by [[Jeff Bergman]]. Daffy and Bugs decide to enter a game show where two best friends test their knowledge of each other, during which Bugs states that he is from the planet Krypton, with his parents cast in a parody of Jor-El and his wife. In the episode "SuperRabbit," Jor-El prosecutes the criminals General Zod (portrayed by Daffy Duck), Faora, and the robot Thunkian for their crimes with the council quoting "guilty" before Jor-El can finish asking for their decision. Jor-El then banishes General Zod and his followers to the Phantom Zone.
*In the fourth season of ''[[Young Justice (TV series)]]'', titled ''Phantoms'' Jor-El is first represented as a statue of solid ice alongside his wife at his grown son's frigid [[Fortress of Solitude]] at the North Pole. He was initially mentioned by the very criminals he himself had imprisoned in the Phantom Zone decades go, as an enemy of the Kryoptonian House of [[Zod (DC Extended Universe)|Zod]] along with his brother [[Zor-El]].

===Films===
====Live-action====
* Jor-El is portrayed by [[Nelson Leigh]] in "Superman Comes to Earth," the first chapter of the 1948 ''[[Superman (serial)|Superman]]'' movie serial.  Portions of this depiction appear in flashback as Lex Luthor recounts the story of Krypton's destruction in "At the Mercy of Atom Man!", the seventh chapter of the 1950 serial ''[[Atom Man vs. Superman]]''. {{citation needed |date=June 2018}}

[[File:Jorel yahoo.jpg|thumb|200px|Marlon Brando as Jor-El, with a baby Kal-El played by Lee Quigley<ref>''Superman: The Movie Magazine''</ref>]]

===== 1978 series =====
* [[Marlon Brando]] played Jor-El in the 1978 film [[Superman (1978 film)|''Superman'']], which [[Alexander Salkind]], his son [[Ilya Salkind]], and their business partner [[Pierre Spengler]] produced and which [[Richard Donner]] directed. In the movie, Jor-El is shown wearing the iconic [[Superman logo|"S"-shield symbol]] as the family crest of the House of El, resembling an Earth "S" by coincidence. The name "Superman" is later coined by [[Lois Lane]] due to the resemblance. In tandem, other Kryptonians are seen wearing their own individualized family crests. Originally thought up by Brando himself and suggested on-set, this origin of the famous Superman symbol has been used in many stories since. In the current comics, however, the shield is the Kryptonian symbol for "hope," and not only is it worn by Jor-El in a similar manner to Brando of the first feature film, but it adorns all manner of Kryptonian flags, clothing, spaceships, and equipment.
* Brando filmed additional footage for the sequel ''[[Superman II]]'', before differences behind the scenes caused his footage to end up on the cutting room floor. It has been restored for the 2006 revised version, ''[[Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut]]''. In the ''Richard Donner Cut'', Jor-El again appears as an image, posthumously attempting to guide and inform Kal-El. Jor-El's historical crystals reveal to [[Lex Luthor]] the existence of the three Phantom Zone criminals [[General Zod]], [[Ursa (comics)|Ursa]] and [[Non (DC Comics)|Non]], which makes Luthor realize just who and what they are (and that it was Superman who caused their release). Jor-El is asked by Clark if he can live a life as a human with Lois, and he tries to persuade Clark not to wish so, but Clark is firm in his wish. Jor-El then reveals the crystal chamber with the rays of Krypton's [[Rao (comics)|red sun]] which will make Clark human forever. Later, Clark returns to find all the crystals and information regarding Krypton destroyed, but finds the original crystal and is able to bring back Jor-El. Jor-El sacrifices his remaining life-force to restore his son's powers so that Superman can save Earth from Zod. Superman later destroys the Fortress after it has been breached by Luthor and the Phantom Zone criminals, but then goes back in time, where it remains normal.
* In 2006, two years after Brando died, he "reprised" the role of Jor-El in ''[[Superman Returns]]'' through the harvesting of archived video footage and sound clip outtakes. In the film, Lex Luthor, having retained vague memories of the place, returns to the Fortress of Solitude during Superman's absence to learn the power of the crystals. After stealing them, he uses one in a [[kryptonite]] tube to create a new continent that threatens to destroy [[United States of America|America]]. Superman manages to throw the "New Krypton" island out of the atmosphere and into space.

===== DC Extended Universe =====
{{main|Jor-El (DC Extended Universe)}}
* [[Russell Crowe]] portrays Jor-El in [[Zack Snyder]]'s [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]] ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1665832/russell-crowe-man-of-steel.jhtml |title=Superman Finds A Dad: Russell Crowe Joins 'Man Of Steel' – MTV Movie News |publisher=MTV |date=2011-06-15 |access-date=2011-07-14}}</ref> In the film, Jor-El is regarded as the most brilliant and renowned scientist on Krypton, where all Kryptonians are genetically engineered as part of a centralized government plan that pre-determines each individual's role in society. Both to preserve the Kryptonian race and provide his son with the distinction of choosing his own destiny, Jor-El steals the Kryptonian genetic codex to send it to other worlds, resulting in his son, the first natural birth on Krypton in ages, who is then sent to Earth. Following a 33-year imprisonment in stasis for an attempted coup in which he murdered Jor-El, General Zod and his lieutenants pursue the infant to Earth, where Clark Kent first encounters his father via an interactive computer hologram that simulates his father's personality and knowledge. The AI of Jor-El was later destroyed by General Zod.

====Animation====
* Jor-El is referenced in the very first episode of the [[Superman (1940s cartoons)|Superman theatrical cartoons]] as one of Krypton's "leading scientists sensing the approach of doom." He then placed Kal-El into a rocket and blasted it off toward Earth just as Krypton exploded.
* In 2011's direct-to-video animated film ''[[All-Star Superman (film)|All-Star Superman]]'', Jor-El and his wife Lara appear briefly in a flashback during the moment they sent their infant son Kal-El to Earth to survive Krypton's destruction. Also, a large statue of Jor-El and one of Lara are kept by Superman in his Fortress of Solitude. Jor-El is also mentioned by Superman when he reveals his origins to fellow Kryptonians Bar-El and Lilo.
* An alternate version of Jor-El appears in ''[[Justice League: Gods and Monsters]]'', voiced by [[Yuri Lowenthal]]. Before he could implant his genetic code onto the ship that would have formed Kal-El, General Zod shows up and shoots him to implant his genetic code on it instead, leading that version of Superman to grow up to look and behave more like Zod.
* Jor-El appears in ''[[Teen Titans Go! To the Movies]]'', voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]]. This version is based on the [[Marlon Brando]] version from the 1978 film.
* Jor-El appears in ''[[Teen Titans Go! & DC Super Hero Girls: Mayhem in the Multiverse]]'', with Fred Tatasciore reprising his role from the 2018 film.
* Jor-El appears in ''[[DC Universe Animated Original Movies|Batman and Superman: Battle of the Super Sons]]'', voiced by [[Nolan North]].
* Jor-El appears in ''[[DC League of Super-Pets]]'', voiced by [[Alfred Molina]].

===Video games===
* In the ''[[Superman Returns (video game)|Superman Returns]]'' video game, Jor-El appears in the cutscene when Lex Luthor breaks into the Fortress of Solitude and takes the Kryptonian crystals of the Fortress. Jor-El also teaches the player how to use the controls in the beginning of the game.

* Jor-El appears in the ''[[DC Universe Online]]'' video game, voiced by [[William Price (actor)|William Price]].

* A large statue of Jor-El and Lara can be seen in the Fortress of Solitude stage in ''[[Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe]]''.

* The ''Man of Steel'' versions of Jor-El appear as a playable character in ''[[Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham]]'', voiced by [[Nolan North]]. In the ''Man of Steel'' DLC map, Jor-El had to fight through General Zod's forces to make sure that baby Kal-El and the Codex can be launched off of Krypton and far away from General Zod's forces. After beating Tor-An, Faora, and General Zod, Jor-El, Kara, and Kelex were able to send baby Kal-El off of Krypton.

* Jor-El is mentioned in the 2017 video game ''[[Injustice 2]]''.

=== Novels ===
==== ''Superman: Last Son of Krypton'' ====
In the [[Elliot S! Maggin]] 1978 novel ''[[Superman: Last Son of Krypton]]'', Jor-El is shown as having sent a navigation probe ahead of Kal-El's spaceship, in order to find a suitable foster parent on his new planet. In Kryptonian society, scientific achievement was a preeminent virtue, so Jor-El's probe was programmed to seek out the leading scientific mind on Earth, presumably to adopt Kal-El. The probe landed (in the early 1950s, although the date is non-specific) in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], where it soon appeared outside the window of [[Albert Einstein]] and communicated its mission to him through [[telepathy]], along with precise details of where Kal-El's rocket would land (near [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]], [[Kansas]]), several days later.

==== ''The Last Days of Krypton'' ====
In the 2007 novel ''The Last Days of Krypton'' by [[Kevin J. Anderson]], Jor-El is shown as a science hero who is respected and admired by all of the people of Krypton and has a standing offer of a place on the Council. Yet his clashing with this conservative Council over new discoveries supplies much of the tension in the book. General Zod and his two minions make a bid to take over Krypton, first posing as Krypton's saviours.
