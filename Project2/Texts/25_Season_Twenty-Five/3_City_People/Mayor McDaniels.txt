People, this is the most exciting time in the history of South Park. As you know, there are people from all over the country leaving the cities and coming to small, rural towns like ours. I've always dreamed of South Park becoming more than a little hick town.  And these city people bring with them... a new hope. People... we have a giant problem. There are now so many city people looking for houses in South Park...that it could destroy our rebounding economy. They are, but Mr. Kim has a theory, and I think you all better listen to him. Mr. Kim. So then we have to find a way to stop this. Realtors don't care about anything but money. We have to show them who's really in charge of this town...Jimboâ€”go to your gun store and get the necessary supplies. I'm declaring open season...on real estate agents.
