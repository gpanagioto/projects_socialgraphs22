==Fictional character biography==
Talos, considered a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|Mutant]] by his people, is a [[Skrull]] that was born without the ability to shape shift. He made up for it by becoming one of the most feared Skrulls on his planet earning the title '''Talos the Untamed''' due to his savage and sinister nature. After getting captured by the [[Kree]], he refused to commit suicide in the hopes of gaining glory for his survival. Instead, he was ridiculed and renamed the more humiliating "Talos the Tamed."<ref>{{cite comic|title=Annihilation: The Nova Corps Files|volume=1|issue=#1|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|date=August, 2006}}</ref>

Talos soon found himself at the wedding of [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] and [[Marlo Chandler]], courtesy of the [[Impossible Man]].<ref>{{cite comic|title=[[The Incredible Hulk]]|volume=1|issue=#418|writer=[[Peter David]]|artist=[[Gary Frank (comics)|Gary Frank]]|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|date=June, 1994}}</ref> He found himself confronted by the [[Hulk]] and tried to get him to fight him in an attempt to reclaim glory from his people. When the Hulk found out what he was up to, he ceased fighting him. Talos left in frustration, but the Skrulls found his attempt to battle him impressive.<ref>{{cite comic|title=[[The Incredible Hulk]]|volume=1|issue=#419|writer=[[Peter David]]|artist=[[Roger Cruz]]|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|date=July, 1994}}</ref>

Talos was called to the planet Godthab Omega by [[Glorian]] where he ended up battling [[Devos the Devastator]].<ref>{{cite comic|title=Annihilation: Ronan|volume=1|issue=#2|writer=[[Simon Furman]]|artist=[[Jorge Lucas]]|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|date=July, 2006}}</ref> They were both captured and imprisoned when the planet suddenly came under attack by the [[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation Wave]] allowing the two to escape.<ref>{{cite comic|title=Annihilation: Ronan|volume=1|issue=#3|writer=[[Simon Furman]]|artist=[[Jorge Lucas]]|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|date=August, 2006}}</ref> Talos soon ran into [[Ronan the Accuser]], whom he hated for being a [[Kree]], but was forced to heed his warning about leaving the planet.<ref>{{cite comic|title=Annihilation: Ronan|volume=1|issue=#4|writer=[[Simon Furman]]|artist=[[Jorge Lucas]]|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|date=September, 2006}}</ref>

He was once again humiliated, this time by his own people, when [[Veranke|Queen Veranke]] refused to allow him to be a part of the [[Secret Invasion]] due to him not having the ability to shape shift. Though Chancellor Kal'Dul didn't lose the hope of Talos' possible participation.<ref name="Skrulls">{{cite comic|title=Skrulls!|volume=1|issue=#1|writer=Ronald Byrd, Michael Hoskin, Gabriel Shechter, John Rhett Thomas, Stuart Vandal, Jeph York|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|date=July 23, 2008}}</ref>

Talos became a member of the United Front to fight the Annihilation Wave.<ref>{{cite comic|title=Annihilation: Saga|volume=1|issue=#1|writer=Michael Hoskin|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|date=July, 2007}}</ref>

Talos next showed up at [[Howard the Duck]]'s private investigations in make up and a beard as '''Jonathan Richards'''. He tasks Howard with finding a necklace that was stolen by the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]].<ref>{{cite comic|title=[[Howard the Duck]]|volume=5|issue=#1|writer=[[Chip Zdarsky]]|artist=Joe Quinones|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|date=March 11, 2015}}</ref> When Howard finally retrieves it, Talos abandons his disguise to reveal that the necklace contains the Abundant Gems, less powerful versions of the [[Infinity Gems]] that can still make one "marginally" powerful, which he plans to use to gain favor with the Skrulls again. He was defeated by Howard and his friend Tara Tam, and apprehended by the [[Fantastic Four]].<ref>{{cite comic|title=[[Howard the Duck]]|volume=5|issue=#3-5|writer=[[Chip Zdarsky]]|artist=Joe Quinones|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|date=July–October, 2015}}</ref>

In the aftermath of the "[[Empyre]]" storyline, Emperor Hulkling dispatched him to investigate the Kree and Skrull bases that went dark with Av-Rom, Keeyah, M'lanz, Virtue, and Tarna. Two days later, a Kree/Skrull Alliance armada headed by General Kalamari finds Talos' escape pod. After recuperating in the sick bay, Talos recaps to Kalamari about what happened on his mission that involved an encounter with [[Knull (character)|Knull]]. Talos then informs Kalamari that his distress beacon on his escape pod is a warning that Knull is coming. Outside the ship, Knull is riding a Symbiote Dragon as he swoops in for an attack.<ref>''Web of Venom: Empyre's End'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Unlike his Skrull brethren, Talos is incapable of shapeshifting and has been branded as having a genetic defect by his people.<ref name="Bustle" /><ref name="Skrulls" /> To make up for this, he has been granted superhuman strength and durability and can hold his own against the likes of the Hulk. He possesses a cybernetic eye after losing his real one in combat.<ref>{{cite comic|title=[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z]]|volume=1|issue=#11|writer=|artist=|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|date=December, 2009}}</ref>

* Talos first appears in the live-action film ''[[Captain Marvel (film)|Captain Marvel]]'' (2019).<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://ew.com/movies/captain-marvel-first-look-images/#ready-for-takeoff|title=See 10 Exclusive Images From ''Captain Marvel''|last=Coggan|first=Devan|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=September 5, 2018|accessdate=September 5, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190312225701/https://ew.com/movies/captain-marvel-first-look-images/|archivedate=March 12, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bustle.com/p/talos-marvel-comics-backstory-is-so-much-darker-than-captain-marvel-16175916|title=Captain Marvel's Movie Foe Doesn't Even Appear In Any Of Her Comics|last=Tenreyro|first=Tatiana|website=[[Bustle (magazine)|Bustle]]|date=March 6, 2019|accessdate=July 3, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190306141235/https://www.bustle.com/p/talos-marvel-comics-backstory-is-so-much-darker-than-captain-marvel-16175916|archivedate=March 6, 2019}}</ref> While seeking refuge from the Kree, Talos and his people received unexpected aid from renegade Kree scientist [[Mar-Vell (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Mar-Vell]], who had rejected her species' war with the Skrulls and fled to Earth. Mar-Vell sheltered Talos and his family while working on a [[Tesseract (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tesseract]]-powered engine that would have allowed the Skrulls to settle beyond the Kree Empire's reach. However, the Kree eventually found and killed Mar-Vell. In 1995, Talos continues to lead the Skrulls in their fight with the Kree, during which they capture [[Carol Danvers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Carol Danvers]]. Using a mind-probing machine on her, Talos and the Skrulls discover that she knew Mar-Vell, but before they can learn more, Danvers breaks free and escapes to Earth. Talos and a small group of Skrulls pursue her and take on human disguises, with Talos assuming the role of [[S.H.I.E.L.D. (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] director Keller.<ref name="EWMendelsohn">{{cite magazine|url=https://ew.com/movies/2018/09/07/captain-marvel-ben-mendelsohn-skrulls/|title=Ben Mendelsohn thinks the evil Skrulls in Captain Marvel are just 'misunderstood'|last=Coggan|first=Devan|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=September 7, 2018|accessdate=September 7, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190701001834/https://ew.com/movies/2018/09/07/captain-marvel-ben-mendelsohn-skrulls/|archivedate=July 1, 2019}}</ref> They eventually find her and Talos arranges a parley to reveal to Danvers and S.H.I.E.L.D. agent [[Nick Fury (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nick Fury]] the truth of the Kree-Skrull war. Sympathizing with his cause, Danvers leaves Earth to help the Skrulls find a new home.
** Mendelsohn described Talos in this film as "more laid back, a bit tougher, [and] a little bit nastier" compared to his human persona, Keller (whom Mendelsohn also portrays), who is more "buttoned-up". He further elaborated, "The thing is, when you're Skrullin', there's a kind of take-no-prisoners vibe about it, which is more relaxed. [As a human] This guy’s got to follow protocol because it's S.H.I.E.L.D." When portraying Talos, Mendelsohn uses his native Australian accent, and an American accent while he is in his S.H.I.E.L.D. disguise, which Mendelsohn compared to that of American politician [[Donald Rumsfeld]]. Mendelsohn noted there was "a very lengthy discussion" regarding the accent for the Skrulls, adding "There's a certain kind of earthy correctness to an Australian delivery". It took Mendelson a "couple of hours" to have his makeup and prosthetics applied to portray Talos.<ref name="EWMendelsohn" /> Executive producer Johnathan Schwartz added that "it's sort of fun to show off both the Skrull's powers and Ben's range as an actor because he's very different in all of those parts."<ref name="ColliderSetVisit28Things">{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/captain-marvel-plot-details/|title='Captain Marvel': 28 Things to Know About the Marvel Cinematic Universe Prequel|website=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]|last=Nemiroff|first=Perri|date=January 8, 2019|accessdate=January 8, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190108214517/http://collider.com/captain-marvel-plot-details/|archivedate=January 8, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] noted that one of the big motifs in the film is the way that war can corrupt people on every side of it, and that a lot of Talos' character arc has to do with this.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2019/3/9/18252301/captain-marvel-spoilers-10-questions|title=10 questions we have about Captain Marvel|first=Karen|last=Han|date=9 March 2019|website=Polygon}}</ref> [[Den of Geek!]] considered Mendelsohn's portrayal of Talos a highlight of the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/us/go/279808|title=Ben Mendelsohn Talks Captain Marvel Skrull Reveal|website=Den of Geek}}</ref>
