==Fictional character biography==
'''Molly Fitzgerald''' was born in [[Dunshaughlin]], Ireland, and was the daughter of a militant member of the [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]]. As Shamrock, she serves as a vessel for displaced [[poltergeist]]s and souls that have died as innocent victims of war; these spirits manifest themselves for fractions of seconds to cause good luck for her and bad luck for those who oppose her.<ref name=autogenerated1>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #24. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

She was teleported away by the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]], along with hundreds of other heroes of Earth, so that the Grandmaster and [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]] could choose champions from among them. Shamrock was chosen for Death's team, fighting alongside fellow heroes [[Peregrine (comics)|Peregrine]], [[Iron Man]], [[Vanguard (Marvel Comics)|Vanguard]], [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], [[Arabian Knight (comics)#Abdul Qamar|Arabian Knight]], [[Sabra (comics)|Sabra]], [[Invisible Woman]], [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]], [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]], [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]], and the [[Collective Man]]. When the Grandmaster's team won the contest, the heroes were returned to Earth.<ref>''Marvel Super-Heroes: Contest of Champions'' #3. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Shamrock is possessed by the souls of thousands of victims of wars who manifest themselves as poltergeists which affect probability within a 20-foot [[radius]] of her, altering situations so that she is given an advantage, in essence having "The Luck of the Irish."<ref name=autogenerated1/><ref>{{Cite web |last=Wickline |first=Dan |date=2014-03-17 |title=A St. Paddy's Day Tip-O'-The-Hat To Marvel's Shamrock |url=https://bleedingcool.com/comics/a-st-paddys-day-tip-o-the-hat-to-shamrock/ |access-date=2022-08-25 |website=Bleeding Cool News And Rumors |language=en}}</ref>

== Reception ==

=== Critical reception ===
Jack Beresford of ''[[The Irish Post]]'' stated, "Though far from a fan favourite, Shamrock remains a character of huge potential. [...] Far from a popular presence in the world of Marvel comics, should the MCU succeed in resurrecting this decidedly one-dimensional Irish superhero stereotype, then it could rank among their greatest achievements."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Beresford |first=Jack |title=Will Marvel ever make a movie about Shamrock their one and only Irish superhero? |url=https://www.irishpost.com/news/will-marvel-ever-make-a-shamrock-superhero-movie-169195 |access-date=2022-08-25 |website=The Irish Post}}</ref> Nicholas Conley of ''[[Grunge.com]]'' asserted, "Now, one aspect of Shamrock's origins that is potentially interesting is that her body has supposedly become a vessel for the many souls of innocent lives lost during war, a concept that could be fleshed out. However, the stereotypical nature of everything else about Shamrock is really hard to overlook, so it's not surprising that the character has sunken into deep obscurity."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Conley |first=Nicholas |date=2017-11-15 |title=Superheroes That Comic Book Creators Wish You Would Forget |url=https://www.grunge.com/96006/superheroes-comic-book-creators-wish-forget/ |access-date=2022-08-25 |website=Grunge.com |language=en-US}}</ref> Eric Nierstedt of ''[[ComicsVerse]]'' wrote, "Molly Fitzgerald is authentically Irish (born in Dunshaughlin), and has a unique power. The souls of war victims surround her body and manipulate probability in her favor. Unfortunately, she has the stereotypical Irish look of green eyes and long red hair and dresses in a green costume that forcibly tells people she’s Irish. Also, her abilities basically mean that her superpower is being lucky. At that point, readers are waiting to hear how she gets her powers from drinking a mixture of Guinness and Lucky Charms. So while Shamrock might be an Irish superhero, she’s sadly defined by that and that alone."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Nierstedt |first=Eric |date=May 16, 2017 |title=The Irish in Comics Part 1: Ten Irish Comic Characters |url=https://comicsverse.com/the-irish-in-comics-part-1-ten-irish-comic-characters/ |website=[[ComicsVerse]]}}</ref> Matthew Wood of ''[[CBR.com]]'' said, "A red-haired woman who dresses like a shamrock-themed billiard ball, Molly Fitzgerald's usually seen as the most stereotypically Irish hero imaginable. Her power set doesn't disabuse anyone of this notion, since she has "the luck of the Irish" to help her win fights."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Wood |first=Matthew |date=2019-10-18 |title=10 Bad Superpowers (That Are Secretly Amazing) |url=https://www.cbr.com/worst-funniest-superpowers-secretly-amazing/ |access-date=2022-08-25 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref>

==Other versions==
In the ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'' universe, she became infected with the zombie virus and traveled the world in search of uninfected humans, which had become all but extinct. She encountered Earth-616 (Marvel's core universe)'s [[Deadpool]], who was traveling with two A.I.M. scientists and a zombie-head Deadpool. [[Tigra]] assisted Shamrock in trying to eat the humans but was destroyed by the scientists. Shamrock boasted that her luck powers would allow her to prevail in a fight against him until Deadpool began conversing with her about how hard it must be living with her insatiable hunger, but having nothing to eat. He then pulled her around to the idea that sometimes death might be preferable to such an existence to which she agonizingly agreed. In having admitted that, her own power worked against her, increasing her luck that she could be killed which Deadpool was happy to help her accomplish, cutting her in half, lengthwise with a [[katana]].<ref>''Deadpool: Merc With a Mouth'' #8.

In an alternate future seen in ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (1969 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy Annual]]'' #3 in 1993, Shamrock becomes one of the many powers involved in the Ireland-based resistance against the invading Martians. She works closely with [[Doctor Druid]]; part of her duties is to guard the [[Book of Kells]], which had the Martian battle added to it. Her adventures allow her to live long into what is to her, the future.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy Annual'' #3 (January 1993). Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>
