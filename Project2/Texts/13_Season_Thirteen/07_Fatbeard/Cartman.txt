You guys! You guys! We can finally do it! We can finally leave this crappy town and live the life we've all dreamed of! Haven't you assholes been watching the news?  Somalia. North Africa. Just picture it, guys: clear blue water with skull islands. Waterfalls and jeweled treasure underneath. I've worked it all out on Expedia.  We can take Southwest Airlines to Miami, then Dubai Air here to Cairo, and then it's just a 49-hour bus ride into Mogadishu, with all the booty and plunder a pirate could want. Right, and wi-  Wait a minute. You never think my ideas are good, Kyle. Wow, cool! Wait a minute. The fuck?! Why would you do that? Unless... you're trying to trick me somehow.

So you decided to join Captain Cartman's edjeh...  Uh, guys, who let in the g-i-n-g-e-r? But guys, g-i-n-g-e-rs can't be pirates because they don't have souls. Please get it out of here.

"It isn't safe." That's not what you said back in the cafeteria, Kyle. In the cafeteria you said Somalia was "awesome." Or are you lying now? So many lies, Kyle, you can't even keep them straight. You just couldn't stand that we were living in paradise while you were back home. Your brother is with Butters taking inventory of our latest plunder, Kyle. You... just sit tight till we hear about your ransom money, hmhmm. Go on! Walk the plank, you scurvy dog! That's Captain Cartman, you Jewswoggle! What?! Clyde!  You guys cannot leave the pirate club now! How can you not want to stay in this paradise we've created?! In Somalia, people have no laws! They have no rules! And they never grow old! Nobody's goin' anywhere!! I'm the captain of this outfit!  Now, is there any question who's in charge? I have an entire pirate crew willing to do anything for me!
