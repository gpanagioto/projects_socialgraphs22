With chicken after chicken being violated, the South Park police are under increasing pressure to solve the case of the Chickenfucker. We now go live to a press conference where Officer Barbrady and the Mayor are fielding questions. And so Officer Barbrady has taken a leave of absence, and South Park would have to manage without any police force for a while-- This just in! South Park is plunged into total anarchy! Exactly two seconds after the retirement of Officer Barbrady, looting and pillaging erupted in the quiet mountain town! And so today South Park held a parade to honor Officer Barbrady and his heroic work on the Chickenfucker case.
