==Fictional character biography==

Fernando Lopez was born in the country of San Diablo. He became a revolutionary, and later a mercenary. He joined [[Batroc the Leaper|Batroc's Brigade]].<ref>''Captain America'' #302</ref> He then first battled [[Captain America]] alongside Batroc's Brigade.<ref>''Captain America'' #303</ref> He next battled [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]] alongside Batroc's Brigade, which had been hired for that purpose by [[Trick Shot (comics)|Trickshot]].<ref>''Solo Avengers'' #3</ref>

Later, Machete was employed by [[Baron Zemo#Baron Helmut Zemo|Baron Zemo]] with the assistance of Batroc's Brigade to steal the skeleton of [[Ulysses Bloodstone]].<ref>''Captain America'' #357</ref> Machete traveled to the Amazon Jungle with Batroc's Brigade, and was captured by Incas.<ref>''Captain America'' #358</ref> Machete battled the Incas alongside Batroc's Brigade, Zemo, Captain America, and [[Diamondback (Rachel Leighton)|Diamondback]]. Machete then battled Captain America alongside Batroc's Brigade.<ref>''Captain America'' #359</ref> Machete traveled to the Bermuda Triangle, where he battled Captain America again alongside Batroc's Brigade.<ref>''Captain America'' #360</ref> He traveled to Egypt alongside Batroc's Brigade in search of the Bloodstone fragment.<ref>''Captain America'' #361</ref> He traveled to Tokyo alongside Batroc's Brigade.

Fernando's brothers, Alfonso and Mariano Lopez, have also each briefly taken on the role.

==Powers and abilities==

Fernando Lopez is an athletic man with no superhuman powers. He is an expert with bladed weapons and the throwing of such weapons. For instance, when he attacked [[Captain America]] with the intent of stealing his shield, Machete was able to specifically destroy the superhero's shield's internal holding straps while he was wielding it by them in combat, which made the shield much more cumbersome for Captain America to use.<ref name=autogenerated1>''Captain America'' #302 (Feb. 1985)</ref> He has extensive knowledge of guerilla warfare tactics.

Machete wore a bulletproof Kevlar flak jacket with a variety of pockets and pouches for carrying various weapons, particularly throwing-knives. He wore custom-made combat boots with additional weapons pouches; the remainder of his costume consisted of conventional military surplus items. Machete carried a variety of specially manufactured weighted steel throwing knives, two three-foot machetes, and other items as necessary. Additionally, his costume's gloves were equipped with strong electromagnets to help him retrieve his weapons in case he was disarmed.<ref name=autogenerated1/>
