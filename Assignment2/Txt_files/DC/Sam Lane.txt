'''Samuel Lane''' is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]].<ref>''The Adventures of Superman'' #593 (August 2001)</ref> He is the father of [[Lucy Lane]] and [[Lois Lane]] and the father-in-law of [[Superman|Clark Kent/Superman]]. 

[[Denis Arndt]] and [[Harve Presnell]] portrayed the character in the series ''[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'', [[Michael Ironside]] in ''[[Smallville]]'', [[Glenn Morshower]] in ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'', and [[Dylan Walsh]] in ''[[Superman & Lois]]''.

==Publication history==
Sam Lane, along with his wife Ella was introduced in ''[[Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane]]'' #13 (November 1959) as a horse farmer in the town of Pittsdale. He was created by [[Robert Bernstein (comics)|Robert Bernstein]] and [[Kurt Schaffenberger]]. Following ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]],'' a reboot of the [[DC Universe]] continuity, he has been portrayed as a US Army General.

==Fictional character biography==
Following ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' Sam Lane was reinvented as a hard-bitten and outspoken [[US Army]] [[General]], with an awkward relationship with his daughter. It was explained that Lane had wanted his eldest child to be a boy, so had treated Lois as a surrogate son, when he was present at all.

This version first appeared in ''[[Superman (comic book)|The Adventures of Superman]]'' #424 (January 1987), the first retitled issue of the former ''Superman'' title. He became a more significant character following Lois' engagement to [[Clark Kent]], being highly unimpressed with the mild-mannered reporter despite his obvious commitment to Lois. This almost, but not quite, extended to refusing to attend the wedding.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

When [[Lex Luthor]] became [[President of the United States]], he made Lane [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]]. This inevitably led to Lois, as an investigative journalist trying to prove Luthor was crooked, opposing her father, especially during the buildup to the [[Our Worlds At War|Imperiex War]]. During the War, General Lane was apparently killed by an Imperiex probe, when he detonated the nuclear engine of his tank to crack the shell of the probe and give [[Black Lightning]] the chance to get through its armor.<ref>''Action Comics'' #781 (September 2001). DC Comics.</ref>

In ''[[Action Comics]]'' #832 (December 2005), set at [[Halloween]], Sam Lane's ghost appeared to Lois while she was trapped in a car, enabling them to talk through their unresolved issues. The last scene of the issue showed the "ghost" leaning against a wall and watching the sunrise, suggesting that General Lane had found lasting peace. Some have also interpreted this as a sign that Sam Lane is somehow still alive.

===Project 7734===
While believing that their father is dead, Lois and Lucy still grieve for their father. Lucy decides to try and honor her father's memory and give him the soldier he was denied by joining the U.S. Army. Lucy is wounded during the Amazon's attack on Washington D.C. and is secretly rescued and brought to a secret facility. General Sam Lane finally reveals himself alive and in charge of a covert operation called [[List of government agencies in DC Comics#Project 7734|Project 7734]]. Lucy volunteers to become [[Superwoman]] and is given a mystically-powered costume that allowed her to pass as [[Kryptonian]]. Lucy is to infiltrate [[Kandor (comics)|Kandor]] and gathering intelligence on the Kryptonians and [[New Krypton]]. Lucy appears to die battling [[Supergirl]] when her suit is ruptured but returns to life with Kryptonian Powers, ready to serve her country again.

General Lane drafts the imprisoned [[Lex Luthor]] into a secret operation against [[Superman]] and the Kryptonians of Kandor. The U.S. government believes the aliens to be a risk for world's security and begins to create countermeasures against them. Though the full implications of the operation are yet known, Lane has apparently been monitoring the activities several new [[superhuman]]s that have appeared following the most recent Crisis. One of the superhumans of particular note is [[Icon (character)|Icon]].<ref>''Superman'' #688 (July 2009). DC Comics.</ref>

After Lois prepares to release a very damaging story, Sam has Lois taken into custody. The two finally meet face to face much to Lois' displeasure. Sam tells Lois the only reason he's being lenient with her is that she is his daughter. He threatens to make her disappear forever in a place where not even Superman can find her. To make his point Sam shoots Lois' [[laptop]] containing her story. He realizes that she has back up copies but he has made his point.<ref>''Action Comics'' #884 (February 2010). DC Comics.</ref>

===War of the Supermen===
{{main|Superman: War of the Supermen}}
When [[General Zod]] declares war on Earth after it is revealed Lex Luthor (through one of his robot doubles) aided [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]] in attacking New Krypton, Lane puts his plans into action. The imprisoned [[Reactron]] reveals that he allowed himself to be captured as part of Lane's plan. The Luthor robot tampers with Reactron's body chemistry, causing him to explode. The resulting chain reaction leads to the destruction of New Krypton and most of the remaining 100,000 Kryptonians, including [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]]'s mother [[Alura (DC Comics)|Alura]].<ref>''Superman: War of the Supermen'' #1 (July 2010). DC Comics.</ref>

Under Lane's orders, Luthor transforms the Earth's sun from yellow to red to rob the Kryptonians of their powers. [[Flamebird]] however neutralizes this countermeasure and the sun reverts to yellow and restores everyone's power. At the same time [[Jimmy Olsen]] and his associates save [[Natasha Irons]] and transmit all of General Lane's activities to news sites all over the [[World Wide Web]]. The remaining Kryptonians, led by [[Ursa (comics)|Ursa]] and Zod himself, begin attacking the Earth, ravaging the planet.<ref>''Superman: War of the Supermen'' #3 (July 2010). DC Comics.</ref> When confronted by an angered Supergirl and his daughter Lois - particularly after Lois points out to him that he has become the monster he claimed the Kryptonians were, as he is one man who destroyed a planet, while Supergirl defies his perception of her people as "rabid dogs" by sparing his life when it would have been easy for her to kill him - Lane commits suicide rather than be made accountable to an international court.<ref>''Superman: War of the Supermen'' #4 (July 2010). DC Comics.</ref>

DC Comics.</ref> Sam Lane is also seen in the relaunched Superman comics which chronologically takes place five years later in the present day, and his relationship with Superman is not that much different, right to the point where he accuses Superman that his presence in Metropolis is what attracts all the super-powered menaces and for that reason his daughter will always be in danger even though she is now a news producer instead of a reporter.<ref>''Superman'' (vol. 3) #2. DC Comics.</ref>

==Reception==
Chad Derdowski of Mania.com felt that Sam Lane would have been a formidable villain to use for a [[Zack Snyder]] Superman film, stating that "Lane would provide a little more dramatic oomph for the film, driving a wedge between the [[relationship of Clark Kent and Lois Lane]] and turning the whole thing into a family affair."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mania.com/10-superman-villains-snyder-couldve-used_article_125629.html |title=10 SUPERMAN Villains Snyder Could've Used |publisher=Mania.com |date=October 7, 2010 |access-date=2013-05-19 |last=Derdowski |first=Chad |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141213015656/http://www.mania.com/10-superman-villains-snyder-couldve-used_article_125629.html |archive-date=December 13, 2014 }}</ref>
