 ARRRGH! I've got the video camera. Got it turned on again.  Wave to the camera, Shelly. ''I don't know'' what to do. I'm so startled. Jesus, this thing is worldwide?  Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my Gohhhd! Gotta get out! Hey we're down in... Main Street now and...  Ohhh! We've got to get out of town. Go through that way.  Oh Jesus!  There's Sharon and Shelly running. Wave to the camera, Shelly!  Oh God, oh God I'm so startled. Are you startled, Sharon? Hold on, hold on, I need to get a shot of it from outside.  Here we see a view from outside the bus. I got a... really good shot of it, Sharon.  All right, all right. Here's Sharon and Shelly on the roof of Best Buy. We, we run up here to get off the streets. We found the Stotch family hiding up here also. There's Chris and Linda, and their son Butters. That's a that's a, that's a new sound.  Go! Go go go go go!  Oh no! Oho oho.  Oh, my god!!  Whoa, that startled me! That was ''really'' startling! We're in the  grocery store now. Some of the survivors here uh.  I'm so startled.  Oh God, what are we gonna dooo? You can't help him! No, it's a guinea mouse, stupid!  It's okay, Shelly. Daddy's gonna turn on night vision.  Nothing, sorry. I just startled myself. Gaaah!  It's been three days now since the guinea pigs and the guinea bees attacked. Guinea rabbits are still everywhere, along with a few guinea panthers. We've taken shelter at the Outback Steakhouse. There's Sharon and Shelly. Say "hey" guys. I'm gon-, I'm gonna take a look outside!  What is it? Oh no, I'm way too startled! Jesus, they can't kill it!  Oh I know, hold out your palm so it looks like you're holding the Guineasaurus Rex. Shelly? Sharon, you're gonna be really glad we have all this footage of the family someday.
