Hello. You're the boy responsible for the South Park Super School News? We would like to give you $26 million.  Contracts, and the first check. We'd love to be in business with you. I represent an organization called Geico. It's an insurance company. We think Super School News would be a great way for us to reach new customers. We've heard all about that, so we thought you could just do some ...news stories about car insurance. Just state the facts, because the truth is, everyone can save by switching to Geico. Everyone's doing it, Jim. You're sort of the last holdout. $26 million just to write some news stories that get people thinking about their insurance coverage? Hm.  Do you really think you can stop ads? You can try to block ads, but they get smarter. The more we ty to shut them out, the more clever they get. There's a war coming, kid, and I'm gonna make sure I'm on the right side of it.
