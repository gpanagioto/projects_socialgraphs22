Stan's House.

Marsh Family


Happy Birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday dear grandpa...



Marvin "Grandpa" Marsh

Uhhhhh.

Marsh Family


...Happy birthday to you.



Sharon

Now blow out the candles grandpa.

-----


Grandpa blows, but nothing comes out but a low moan.

Sharon

Hurray!!!

Randy

How's it feel to be 102, paps?

Grandpa

Shoot me.

Sharon

Make a wish grandpa.

Grandpa

I wish I were dead

Randy

Ha, ha, ha, that's our silly grandpa.

Grandpa

I'm not being silly! Kill me. I'd do it myself, but I'm too damn old.

Sharon

Ooh, who wants ice cream with their cake?

Shelly

I will.

Randy

Me.

Stan

It's eight o'clock, my favorite TV show is on.

Shelly

That show's for babies, it's so stupid.

Stan

Can I eat my cake in the living room mom? Please, can I?

Sharon

Oh, alright, but take your grandpa with you.

Stan

Aw, dammit!

Sharon

Language.

-----


In front of the TV. Stan has his slice of cake with him.

TV Announcer

And now back to Terrance & Phillip.

Phillip

Hey Terrance, I think I have to fart.

Terrance

Wait, before you do, pull my thumb.

-----


Phillip pulls, and Terrance lets loose with a juicy fart. They both laugh.

Stan

Heheheh hehehe...

Grandpa

Uhhhhh

-----


Grandpa lines a shotgun up to his face, but it leaves a big hole in the picture behind him when he shoots.

Grandpa

Ah, dammit!

-----


Stan looks at him.

Granpa

How would you like to make a dollar Billy?

Stan

My name's not Billy, grandpa. It's Stan.

Grandpa

Dammit Billy, do you want a dollar or don't ya?

Stan

Sure.

Grandpa

Ok. You just have to do one thing for me.

Stan

I'm not gonna kill you, grandpa.

Grandpa

Why not?

Stan

'Cause I'll get in trouble.

Grandpa

I killed my grandpa when I was your age.

Stan

Leave me alone, grandpa.

-----


On the TV there's a fart, and more laughter.

Grandpa

What has America's youth come to? Kids won't even kill their own grandparents.

-----


Kyle's House. Ike and Kyle are watching 'Terrance & Phillip'

Phillip

Hey Terrance, now that you've farted, I think I might fart too.

-----


Phillip farts, and they laugh.

Terrance

Ohhh, you farted.

-----


Kyle is laughing pretty hard.

Sheila Broflovski

Kyle, bubbe, what are you watching?

Terrance

Hey Phillip, would you like a flower?

Phillip

I sure would Terrance.

Terrance

Alrighty then, here's a two-lip.

-----


Terrance farts, and they laugh.

Sheila

What is this?

-----


Kyle falls off the armchair laughing.

Sheila

It's horrible!

-----


Kyle gets up off the floor.

Kyle

Dude, it's Terrance & Phillip.

-----


Phillip knocks Terrance's head to one side.

Phillip

Take that, you stupid dick.

Sheila

What did he say?

Terrance

You're an asshole, Phillip.

Sheila

Whatwhatwhaaat?!!?

-----


Laughter. She turns the set off.

Shiela

Young man, you are not to watch that show anymore! It's immature toilet humor!

Kyle

But everybody watches Terrance & Phillip.

-----


Sheila with her arms akimbo.

Sheila

Oh really? Is that so?

-----


Cartman's House.

Terrance

Oh no, Phillip, looks like you're about to fart.

Phillip

You're exactly right, Terrance. Oh.

-----


Fart. Laughter.

Terrance

Oh no.

-----


Laughter.

Cartman

Ha, ha, ha, that's sweet!

Liane

Eric dear? I just got a call from your friend Kyle's mother. She said that this show is naughty, and might make you a potty mouth.

Cartman

That's a bunch of crap! Kyle's mom is a dirty Jew!

Liane

Ohhh, okay hon.

-----


Stan's House. Stan is going to bed, but before entering he reviews his chores for the morrow. Grandpa has added one more...

Stan

I'm not going to kill you, grandpa!

Grandpa

Ingrate!

Stan

Good night, grandpa.

Grandpa

You pompous son of a whore!

-----


Mr. Garrison's Class.

Student

Huh huh, I had another ...

-----


Cartman punches Kyle on the shoulder.

Kyle

Ow! What the hell was that for?!

Cartman

That's for your stupid mother! She made me miss Terrance & Phillip last night!

Clyde

Yeah, what's the big idea having your mom call all our moms last night?

Kyle

Well I didn't have her do it. She did it on her own.

Cartman

Why does this happen every month? It seems like, right around the same time every month, Kyle's mom gets a hair up her ass about something and I always end up getting screwed by it!

Mr. Garrison

Children! Children! A certain student's mother called me last night.

Cartman

[Tauntingly.] Oh, gee, I wonder who's mother that could have been?

Mr. Garrison

She informed me that some of you might be watching a, a naughty show called Terrance & Phillip.

Class

Yeahh, woohoo!

Mr. Hat

Watching that show is bad, Mr. Garrison.

Mr. Garrison

That's right, Mr. Hat. Shows like Terrance & Phillip are what we call 'toilet humor'. They don't expand your minds.

-----


Silence.

Mr. Garrison

You see children, these kind of shows are senseless, vile trash.

-----


Kenny walks in.

Mr. Garrison

Kenny, why are you late to class?

-----


Kenny hands Mr. Garrison a note. The note reads 'Please excuse me for being late. I have explosive Diarrhea. signed -K'

Mr. Garrison

Oh, okay Kenny, be seated.

-----


Addressing the class.

Mr. Garrison

Now, as I was saying, the reason that parents of South Park are so upset is because...

-----


Kenny is waving his hand frantically.

Mr. Garrison

Yes Kenny, what is it?

Kenny

(I have to go poop.)

Mr. Garrison

I thought you just came from the bathroom.

Kenny

(I did, I gotta go again...)

Mr. Garrison

Okay okay, go ahead.

-----


Kenny goes in the restroom.

Mr. Garrison

As I was saying, you all seem to enjoy this show, even though it isn't based in reality. There's much more to life than two young men farting on each other. And throughout history there have always been shows that have come and gone that have been very bad, and usually they get taken right off the air. You see, you should be spending your time enlightening your minds with more intelligent entertainment.

-----


Throughout the lecture, sounds of some serious diarrhea come from the bathroom. The sounds get progressively worse as Kenny moans loudly. Kenny reenters the classroom at the end of the lecture. Kenny sits back at his desk and Stan, reacting to the diarrhea's smell, waves his hand in front of his face.

Stan

Whoa! Smells like you slaughtered a cow in there, Kenny!

Mr. Garrison

Pay attention children!

-----


Pounds on the lectern.

Mr. Garrison

I'm going to join your parents in requesting that you don't watch Terrance & Phillip any more, ever.

Cartman

What?

Clyde

Not watch Terrance & Phillip ever?

-----


Kyle's face drops.

Mr. Garrison

That's right, children. Are there any questions?

-----


Stan raises his hand.

Mr. Garrison

Yes, Stanley?

Stan

Is it okay to kill somebody if they want you to?

-----


After a moment of reflection.

Mr. Garrison

What, what do you mean?

Stan

My grandpa keeps asking that I kill him all the time, and sometimes I wonder if I should.

Kyle

Well, then you should. I think that a person has a right to die if they wanna.

Stan

Really??

Kyle

Yeah, there's this guy named Jack Leborkian that goes around and murders people that ask him to, and he doesn't get in any trouble at all.

Stan

Wow!

Cartman

Hey, maybe we can get him to Kyle's mom!

Stan

So, is it okay to assist somebody with suicide, Mr. Garrison?

Mr. Garrison

Uh, Stan, I'm not touching that one with a twenty-foot pole.

Kenny

(OH MY GOD!)

-----


Kenny runs into the bathroom and releases a large splatter of diarrhea.

Kenny

(Owww!) [Splatterrrrr!]

-----


School Cafeteria.

Cartman

Man! I can't believe we're gonna miss Terrance & Phillip today. I think I'm already having withdrawal.

-----


He starts convulsing and making seizure related sounds.

Stan

Don't worry dude, we can all go watch it at my house. My parents don't get home until late.

Kyle

But won't your grandpa be there?

Stan

Yeah...

Cartman

Just kill 'im dude, maybe he'll give you some money.

Chef

Hello there children.

Stan

Hey Chef.

Chef

How's it goin'?

Stan

Bad.

Chef

Why bad?

Stan

Chef, is it okay to kill your grandpa?

Chef

You can't kill my grandpa Stan, he's already passed on.

Stan

No, I mean, kill my grandpa.

Chef

No, I don't think that's okay Stan. In fact, I think that's illegal.

Stan

See, I told you dude.

Kyle

Well, yeah, but what if the grandpa wants to die, cause he's really old, and he's just asking for help?

Cartman

Yeah, like assisted suicide. What about that?

-----


Stops himself twice before responding

Chef

I don't want to touch that with a forty foot pole.

Stan

What's the big deal? Why won't anybody talk about this???

-----


South Park PTA Meeting.

Sheila

And I myself was not aware of this horrible show until recently. I have a clip to demonstrate exactly what I mean.

-----


She puts the tape in and starts the VCR.

Terrance

Hey Phillip, guess what?

Phillip

What?

-----


Rips a fart.

Terrance

Fart.

Sheila

Now apparently, that's supposed to be funny.

Randy

Heh, heh, heh, he farted right on his head, heh heh.

-----


Other PTA members stare at Randy in shock. He looks around chagrined.

Sheila

Not allowing our kids to watch this show is not enough. We need to boycott the entire network! All those in favor...

-----


Loud, juicy fart comes from the little boys room. Mr. Garrison exits.

Mr. Garrison

Ohh, I think I've caught a touch of the flu from little Kenny this morning. I've got the green apple splatters.

-----


Amid peals of laughter.

Townsman

Ha ha, green apple splatters.

-----


Stan's House.

Grandpa

Uhhhh.

Stan

Hi grandpa, I brought my friends over to watch TV, if that's okay.

Grandpa

Billy, help grandpa stick this fork in the outlet.

Stan

No grandpa, I'll get in trouble.

Grandpa

Kill me, God dammit!

Stan

No, I can't even kill a deer.

Grandpa

Well then, have one of your little friends do it. You can kill me can't ya?

Cartman

I would never kill somebody... not unless the piss me off.

-----


Seizing the opportunity.

Grandpa

Ohh, is that a fact? Well, let me tell you something, Porky. Your mom was over here earlier, and I humped her like a little bitch.

Cartman

What!

Grandpa

That's right.

Stan

Grandpa!

Grandpa

And then, I dug up your great-grandma's skeleton, and had my way with her too.

Cartman

Hey!

Grandpa

Choice piece of ass, your great-grandma.

Cartman

You piece of crap! I'll kill you!

Grandpa

That's the spirit, Tubby.

-----


Restraining Cartman.

Stan

Come on, Cartman, he's just trying to get to you.

Cartman

Don't talk about my mom like that!

-----


Dragging Cartman away.

Stan

We can go watch Terrance & Phillip in the kitchen.

Grandpa

I ever tell you about the time I boofed your dad, Fatso?

Cartman

Ah, I can't believe that son of a bitch!

Stan

Here Cartman, have some Snacky Cakes.

Cartman

Oooh, Snacky Cakes, god dang.

Stan

I don't know what to do dude, my grandpa really wants to die.

Kyle

I'm telling you, it's okay. Maybe you should ask the Lord for guidance.

Stan

Hey, yeah!

-----


Stan's House, kitchen.

TV Announcer

And now, back to 'Jesus and Pals' on South Park Public Access.

Jesus

Yea, believe in me and ye shall find peace.

-----


Jesus presses a button on the phone.

Jesus

First caller, you're on 'Jesus and Pals'.

-----


There's an echo.

Caller

Yeah, is this Jesus?

Jesus

Yes, yes caller, you need to turn your TV down, that's why you're getting that weird feedback.

Caller

Oh, sorry.

-----


Caller fixes the echo.

Caller

Uh, this is Martin...

Jesus

Martin, from Aspen Park, yes, I know.

Martin

How the hell'd you know that?

Jesus

Well, maybe because I'm the Son of God, brainiac, now, do you have a question?

Martin

Uh, yeah, uh, I have this cousin who, who cheated on the SAT's and-

Jesus

Tell little Gregory that cheating is lying and lying is wrong, no matter what the circumstance.

Martin

Oh, oh, okay, thanks for the advice, Jesus.

-----


Jesus presses a button on the phone.

Jesus

Next caller, you're on the air.

Stan

Jesus?

Jesus

Yes my son?

Stan

Jesus, is, is it okay to kill somebody if they ask you to, because they're in a lot of pain, you know, like, assisted suicide, is that okay?

Jesus

My son...

Stan

Yes?

Jesus

I'm not touching that with a sixty foot pole.

-----


He presses a button on the phone.

Jesus

Next caller.

Stan

Goddammit!

Jesus

I heard that.

Stan

What the hell is wrong with everybody?

Cartman

Hey you guys, Terrance & Phillip is on!

Kyle

Yeah, hey, do you think we'll get in trouble for watching it?

Stan

Kyle, don't be such a butt-hole!

Cartman

Yeah, just cause your mom is a stupid bitch doesn't mean the whole world has to suffer.

Kyle

Don't call my mom a bitch, Cartman!

Cartman

Oh, biiitch.

-----


Turns around and hoists his ass up to simulate a woman with a big ass.

Cartman

Your—mom—is--a--bi-bi-bii-biittchh.

TV Announcer

And now back to Terrance & Phillip.

Terrance

Hey Phillip, would you like to eat some beans.

Phillip

Oho yeah, I love beans.

Cartman

Uh oh, I bet I know what's coming.

Grandpa

Billy, would you mind holding this for grandpa, please?

Stan

Okay, grandpa, okay. Just get out of the way of the TV.

Terrance

Hey Phillip, it looks like those beans might make me fart.

Phillip

Well, don't fart on me, Terrance.

Cartman

Dude, he's gonna fart on his head again.

Kenny

(Oh my God!)

-----


Kenny runs to the bathroom.

Cartman

Hey, you're gonna miss it, Kenny.

-----


After receiving the dreaded fart.

Phillip

You're such an asshole, Terrance.

Terrance

Haha, that I am!

-----


Laughter.

-----


Disgusting diarrhea sounds.

Kenny

(Ow!)

Cartman

Hurry up Kenny, you're gonna miss the fart.

-----


Shelly walks in.

Shelly

Jesus! What the hell are you doing?

Stan

We're not watching Terrance & Phillip, I swear. I, I mean, Cartman was watching it.

Shelly

No, I mean, what the hell are you doing to grandpa?!

-----


Stan traces the rope and realizes that Grandpa has hung himself, but hasn't died.

Grandpa

Tug - a - little harder, Billy.

Stan

Aaah!!

-----


Releases the rope. Grandpa falls to the ground, landing on his side.

Grandpa

Uh, ow.

Shelly

You little jerk!

-----


Slugs Stan in the face

Shelly

You were trying to kill grandpa! I'm telling mom!

Grandpa

Dammit! I was so close.

-----


Some time later the kids are the ones on television.

TV Announcer

Four third graders from South Park, Colorado, were found trying to viciously murder an innocent grandfather.

Talk Show Host

Boys, how did you get driven so far to the edge? What changed you into such demonic little bastards?

Stan

We didn't know what we were doing. We were just sitting there, watching Terrance & Phillip and...

Talk Show Host

Terrance & Phillip, aha! So it is that show that is to blame.

-----


In front of Tom's Rhinoplasty.

Sheila

These boys minds have been tainted by the garbage on television that they see, and we are fed up!

Crowd

Woooo!

Townsman

Huh? Oh god! Oh god!

-----


Runs into a Port-a-Potty for some quick relief.

Sheila

We have to stop this smut from going on the air. We will march to the network and protest until our demands are met. New York, here we come!

-----


Sound of a deep, wet, sonorous fart.

-----


In front of Cartoon Central.

-----


Cartoon faces of Tragedy and Comedy adorn the signs.

Sheila

We are spreading the word to this establishment that we demand better television, for our children!

-----


Loud cheering from the crowd.

Sheila

We want more quality television, like Full House.

-----


More cheering.

-----


In line to use the Port-a-Potty.

Randy

Oh, I think you gave me the stomach flu, Mr. Garrison.

Mr. Garrison

No, no, it was that little Kenny bastard that gave it to me.

-----


The Mayor exits the Port-a-Potty.

Randy

Whoa, Mayor, you, uh, making gravy in there? Heh, heh, heh, heh.

Mayor McDaniels

I just had a brown baby boy.

-----


Laughter.

-----


Stan's House, in disarray. Kyle is jumping on the sofa, Stan and Cartman are tossing the football, and Kenny is flying a kite.

Kyle

Dude, this is sweet, not having parents around.

-----


The others scramble to the sofa and start jumping.

Stan

Yeah, I hope they protest TV shows forever.

All

Whoopeee!

Grandpa

Come here Billy, I want to show you something.

Stan

Aww, do I have to?

Grandpa

Yes you do, you little pecker! I realized that the reason you won't kill me...

-----


Stan jumps off and follows Grandpa towards his room.

Grandpa

...is because you don't understand how I feel, Billy, but now I found a way to show you what it feels like to be a grandpa.

-----


They both enter, Grandpa shuts the door.

Stan

Hey, what are you doing?!

-----


Grandpa loads a cassette into a tape player.

-----


Outside the room with Kenny and Cartman

Kyle

What are they doing in there?

Cartman

I don't know.

Grandpa

Now, you're about to see what it's like to be as old as me. Are you ready, Billy?

Stan

Uh, I guess.

-----


Grandpa starts the tape, which plays a bit of Muzak that evokes Enya's 'Orinoco Flow (Sail Away)'

Stan

Okay, you, you can let me out now.

Grandpa

Not just yet.

-----


He turns up the volume.

Stan

Let me out, grandpa!

-----


Stan tries to open the door.

Stan

I can't take it anymore, this music is terrible, it's, it's cheesy, but lame and eerily soothing at the same time.

-----


Singer

Grandpa

That's it, now you know what it feels like to be grandpa.

-----


Stan falls out of the room, looking very haggard.

Singer


'Gonna fly, gonna fly, gonna fly'



-----


Grandpa turns off the radio and follows.

Stan

Eh, grandpa, I had no idea how bad it was for you. Now I understand.

Grandpa

So now will you kill me, Billy?

Stan

Sure I will grandpa, I will.

-----


In front of Cartoon Central, New York.

Liane

Hehh, it doesn't look like our protest is working.

Sheila

It'll work, it has to.

Townsman

Look! It's the president of the network.

John Warsog

Ladies and gentlemen, my name is John Warsog, I've prepared a statement for you on behalf of the network.

-----


He clears his throat a couple of times.

John Warsog

Fuck you.

-----


A slight pause.

John Warsog

Thank you ladies and gentlemen. If there are any questions, you may direct them to that brick wall over there.

-----


He turns back towards the building.

Sheila

Hey, you will not get away with this!

-----


He moons the crowd. They gasp in shock. He goes inside and shuts the door.

Sheila

That does it, no more Mr. Nice Protesters. It's time for 'Plan B'.

Liane

Ohho, Carol, where are the Porto-Potties?

Sheila

Over there hon. What, you need to drop some friends off at the pool?

Liane

[Lustily.] Ohhh, yes, indeedy.

-----


They laugh.

-----


Outside of Stan's house.

Stan

Okay grandpa, all you have to do is sit there. We'll do the rest. [To Kyle.] You got the cow all tied up?

Kyle

Yep, all done.

Stan

'Kay, come on guys.

-----


The boys struggle to lift the cow over grandpa's head.

Cartman

Why don't we just shoot him?

Stan

You dumbass Cartman, it has to look natural, or else we'll all get busted.

Kyle

Yeah, stupid!

Grandpa

That's good Billy, a little higher now.

Cow

Moooo!

-----


In front of Cartoon Central.

Sheila

The network is not taking us seriously. In the past, people have had to die for what they believed in, and we are prepared to do the same. Ready?

-----


Mr. McCormick positions himself in front of a large sling shot.

Sheila

Mr. McCormick, you shall be a martyr to us all. God Speed. We will not let these corporate half-wits ruin our children's minds. Launch!

-----


Mr. McCormick is flung into the front of the Cartoon Central building, splattering into bloody death. The crowd gasps.

Sheila

We will all follow suit, one by one if that's what it takes.

-----


Sounds of abdominal pain as people line up to the Porto-potties.

-----


Outside of Stan's house somewhere.

Stan

Are you ready, grandpa?

Grandpa

Does the pope crap in the woods?

-----


Officer Barbrady drives up. He is staring at the scene of a cow dangling above Grandpa by a rope. Stan stands off to the side, knife in hand, ready to cut the rope.

Police Radio

7 Mary 5, code 6 - 105 North Avenue 52.

Cow

Mooo!

Officer Barbrady

Carry on.

-----


He starts the car back up and drives away.

Stan

Ok, here we go. Bye grandpa, it was nice knowing you.

Grandpa

Uhh, cut the damn rope already!

-----


Sounds of thunder. Lightning flashes. Death appears and disappears.

Stan

What is that?!

Kyle

Well, it, it looks like...

All

Death!

Death

Mrrrrr!

-----


He points at them.

Grandpa

It's about time you lazy-ass son of a whore.

-----


Death approaches grandpa.

Grandpa

Come on, let's go.

-----


Death continues past grandpa, towards the kids.

Grandpa

What the...?

Stan

Hey, he's coming towards us.

Kyle

Why is Death coming after us?

Death

Mrrr.

Kids

Ahhh!

-----


The kids run into Stan's house and towards his room, Death in hot pursuit. Stan struggles to open the door.

Cartman

Aaaah, runrunruuun!

-----


They enter the room. Stan bars the door with his body.

Death

Mrrr.

-----


Death bangs on the door.

Kyle

What are we gonna do?

Death

Mooorrrr!

-----


In front of Cartoon Central.

Newscaster

As the day progresses, more and more South Park residents continue to sling shot their bodies into the side of the 'Toon Central building. Toon Central is now under incredible pressure to cancel the show, and has already lost over 20% of their sponsors.

Sheila

Here Carol, I think it's your boy.

Sharon

Oh thanks. What is it Stanley-hon, did you break something?

Stan

Mom! Death is here, and and he's trying to take us all away with him!

Sharon

Stanley, honey, you need to leave mommy alone, I'm doing something very, very important for your little well-being there.

Stan

Yeah, but, mom!

Sharon

Here honey, talk to your father.

Randy

Did you turn the heat down?

Stan

Dad, Death is coming!

Randy

Keep the thermostat under 70, and take care of your grandfather.

-----


He hangs up.

-----


Stan's room. Death is trying to enter.

Death

Mrrrr!

Stan

Dammit! You know, I think that if parents would spend less time worrying about what their kids watch on TV, and more time worrying about what's going in in their kid's lives, this world would be a much better place.

Kyle

Yeah, I think that parents only get so offended by television because the rely on it as a babysitter, and the sole educator of their kids.

Kenny

(You know what I think? Basically, if you let the decision of what you watch stop at the parents' control, then what can you see? It'll stay the same because they'll just get offended although their kids are not delighted with the television series they put on for their kids.)

Kyle

Totally dude.

Stan

Good point man.

Death

Mrrrr!

-----


Death cuts through the door with his scythe.

Stan

Ahhhh!

Kyle

Quick, jump through the window.

Cartman

Ehh, eh, ehhhh!

-----


Kenny pushes Cartman out the window and follows.

Death

Mrrrr!

-----


South Park Main Street.

Kids

Aaaah! Aaaah! Aaaah!

-----


Death is following the kids on a tricycle. Grandpa tries to keep up on his electric wheelchair.

Grandpa

Come back here, you pompousy son of a pansy!

Kids

Aaaah!

-----


Kyle sees Death close to Kenny.

Kyle

Don't let him touch you! You die if he touches you!

Grandpa

Come over here, you son of a whore!

-----


Death ignores him, but something in T.V. World makes Death take a second look. Terrance and Phillip are on TV floating in spacesuits. There are seven screens - a giant central one flanked by three smaller ones on each side.

Phillip

Uhh, oh Terrance? What color is the wind?

Terrance

Hmmm, I don't know, why don't you check?

-----


Farts. Canned laughter.

Phillip

Oh, you farted.

-----


Death laughs.

Terrance

Ohho God.

-----


Death is laughing uncontrollably.

Terrance

Hey Phillip, you know what my space suit smells like?

Phillip

No Terrance, why don't you tell me?

Terrance

Well, it smells like, a dirty fart!

-----


Laughter. Death laughs.

Stan

[Noticing.] Hey look!

-----


After Terrance farts.

Phillip

Oh, there's one.

-----


The kids go back to watch the show with Death. They are all laughing.

-----


In front of Cartoon Central.

Newscaster

Hours have passed, and still the die hard South Park parents are killing themselves in front of the 'Toon Central building, one by one. Worse yet, the stomach flu that seems to be going around is...

-----


He puts his hand to his earphone.

Newscaster

Wait, wait, I'm getting word that the president of the network is going to make a statement!

-----


The door to Cartoon Central opens. The president emerges wearing a gas-mask.

Townsman

Wait, wait.

John Warsog

Ladies and gentlemen, your nazi-esque tactics of trying to stink us out with your rancid feces ... has worked.

-----


Shot of a large pile of crap lying in front of the two Porto-potties.

John Warsog

Therefore, today we will be officially taking Terrance & Phillip off the network and replacing it with reruns of She's the Sheriff, starring Suzanne Somers.

-----


The crowd cheers.

John Warsog

Now get away from here, and take your diarrhea with you!

-----


The crowd continues to cheer.

Townsman

Huh, oh no!

-----


He is launched, and he leaves a bloody mess on the sign.

Sheila

At last, now we can return to normality.

-----


Television store in downtown South Park.

Terrance

Hey, Phillip.

Phillip

Yes, Terrance?

Terrance

Is there a penny stuck in my butt?

Phillip

Well I don't know, Terrance, let me check.

Cartman

Uh oh, don't look there, Phillip, you're gonna get farted on.

-----


Static appears on the TV, and then a new screen comes up.

TV Announcer

We interrupt this program to bring you loud static.

-----


Loud Static. Death is upset and resumes his mission.

Death

Mrrrrr!

Kids

Ahhh!

-----


South Park Main Street. Death turns and touches Kenny, and Kenny falls over, dead.

Kyle

Oh my God, they killed Kenny. You Bastard!!!

Stan

Wow, I guess Death was just coming after Kenny the whole time.

Grandpa

Hey, you were supposed to kill me!

Death

Mrrr.

Grandpa

That's not fair, Goddammit! My grandpa asked me to kill him and I did it.

-----


Death points a cold finger up the street. From a misty haze emerges an incredibly haggard looking ghost of a man.

Stan

Whoa!

Great-Great-Grandpa

Billllyyyy...

Grandpa

Grandpa?

Great-Great-Grandpa

That's right, Billy.

Grandpa

My name's not Billy, grandpa. And what's wrong with you? Why do you look all haggard?

Great-Great-Grandpa

I asked you to kill me, Billy, but I was wrong. And now I'm forced to spend eternity in limbo.

Grandpa

Limbo?

Great-Great-Grandpa

I was wrong to put you in that position, Billy, just like you're wrong to put Little Billy in it now. You're so obsessed with ending your life, you're not thinking about what you're doing to his. You must wait to die of natural causes.

Grandpa

But I've been waiting for 25 years.

Great-Great-Grandpa

Let nature run its course, or else end up in limbo. Natural causes Billy, natural causes...

Death, Great-great-grandpa and Kenny's ghost fade away into the mist.

Stan

Come on you guys, let's go home.

-----


A rat comes up and takes Kenny's corpse away.

-----


Stan's House.

Sheila

Here they are!

Randy

Well, we did it son, we fought a battle for your well being, and won.

Stan

What do you mean?

Sharon

We got Terrance & Phillip taken off the air.

Cartman

You son of a bitch, your mom sucks!

Sheila

But look what they put on.

-----


Turns on the TV.

TV Announcer

And now back to She's the Sheriff.

Cartman

Ohhh, God, No!

Suzanne Somers

You are the one behind all these shenanigans.

Dude

Yeah, well you're the stupid ho that started it.

Sheila

What did he say?

Suzanne

Up yours, butt-munch.

Sheila

Whatwhatwhaaat!!!

-----


She turns on her heel and takes up her sign.

Sheila

Come on everybody, back to New York!

-----


The Marshes follow her out the door.

Kyle

Hey Stan, now that Terrance & Phillip has been taken off the air, what are we going to do for entertainment?

Stan

I don't know. We, we could start breathing gas fumes.

Cartman

My uncle says that smoking crack is kinda cool.

Kyle

Hey, why don't we watch some of those porno movie thingies?

Stan

Cool!

Cartman

Yeah!

-----


Grandpa wheels up wearing a touristy shirt, carrying an Africa brochure.

Stan

What are you doing grandpa?

Grandpa

I'm planning a trip to Africa. Did you know that over 400 people are eaten naturally by lions in Africa every year?

Stan

That's my silly grandpa.

-----


All laugh. Kyle farts.
