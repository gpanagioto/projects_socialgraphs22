 Sir, someone is leading a coordinated cyber strike on the TrollTrace website. It could be Russian, we don't know. Whoever this troll is, he's pretty fucking hardcore sir. Trevor's Axiom is a well-known equation in online trolling. It's a way in which one person can create a massive reaction on the Internet. Look, person A trolls person B, but it's not about person B, the troll is trying to push buttons to try and get a reaction from hundreds, eventually creating person C, whose overreaction and self righteousness will elicit a reaction from persons D through F, who weren't trolls but can't help rip on person C. Their reactions lead to outrage persons G through N, and it keeps going, generating massive energy, it's like the fission reaction that leads to a fusion explosion, all bringing out the worst in humanity. Precisely, Mr. President, and if this kind of overreaction can be amplified through the Pentagon servers... There's nothing more we can do. Nearly everyone is online and we diverted all the power we can.
