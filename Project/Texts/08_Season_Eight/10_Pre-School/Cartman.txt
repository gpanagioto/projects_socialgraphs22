Hey gay-butts, what's goin' on? Really? That's cool. When did-  Trent Boyett?! Meanest, dirtiest, toughest kid in the world, super-pissed off at ''us'', Trent Boyett?! Oh, Holy Jesus, God... It's true. He's gonna come for us, you guys. We are dead men. Jews can't ''be'' firemen. Don't call me fat, you stupid Jew! But how do we start a fire? Don't worry, Trent. Shut up, Butters! We know what we're doing! Hey, we didn't start the fire, Trent Boyett did. Trent Boyett is a liar, sir. Whatever. That's like five years from now. Oh Jesus, he's gonna kill us. We-we've gotta tell our parents! You guys, what the fuck are we gonna do?! In case you've forgotten, Trent Boyett is the meanest kid we ever knew. He's gonna tear us apart! We've got to tell them who did this, you guys. We're gonna get it as bad as Butters! Maybe you didn't hear so good in there, Kyle! Second-degree titty-twister!   Okay, so now we just need to get a picture of Stan's mom naked. Cool. I don't know, son. That sounds awfully strange.  You cannot have a picture of my hot breasts. Nononono, you gotta go  "But Mo-o-o-om."  "But ''Mo-o-o-om''." Draw the um- You guys draw the nipples like on the bottom of my ass cheeks. Yeah, but Stan's mom is old; that means her nipples... sag more to the bottom now. Will you guys trust me? I know this stuff! All right! You guys, we're free! We haven't a care in the world! Yeah. Trent's just lucky he didn't mess with us. I woulda kicked his ass. Hey guys, you know what we should do? We should go get a-  He's gonna give us all Texas chili bowls.  A picture of your mom's boobs? A lot of stupid things that we regret. Aaaaaaaah! Yes, our conscience got the best of us and, and we were just about to tell everyone the truth.  Stay away from us, Trent! It's my mom's taser. I took it from her purse.  Just back off, man! I am ''not'' going to have a titty twister! I hate titty twisters! Trent Boyett is a liar, sir. Whatever, that's like five years from now. We did it!  Uh oh. Hah! Hey!
