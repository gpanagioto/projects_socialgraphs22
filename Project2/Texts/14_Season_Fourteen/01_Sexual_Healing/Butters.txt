Holy moly, what's that between the lady's legs? It's all bushy.  I've never seen that part of a lady! Do they all got a hedge like that? Do they??  Did you see that bush on that lady?? What the heck was that?? Gee whiz, it was like almost up to her belly button! Oh no! It was just... so big and bushy sir. Why does it look like that? Oh no. I don't wanna have to buy a Batman costume. There! It was like that! It looked just like that!  Just like this, buh, but smaller, and right in the place where her underwear should've been. If I trim it down, it'll look right..  But this is what I keep seeing in my head!  No, uh, if I can just see it again, I, I'll be fine. Haah! Leave me alone!  Me, I just... Well I just can't stop thinking about bush. I mean it's like, what is it? What does it mean? Why would there be a bush right there? Is it a live bush? Are there berries? Oh good, 'cause I really can't take it anymore. Yeah, it feels great! I never wanna see bush again!  I finally paid a lady to show me hers. You wanna know what's under that bush? Nothin' but a pair of sick Joker lips.
