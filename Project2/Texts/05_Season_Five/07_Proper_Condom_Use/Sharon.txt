I was really happy with this month's book. I agree with what Bob and Linda said- Not now, Stanley. This is Mommy and Daddy's book club night, remember? Later, sweetie.  Anyway, I found myself enticed by Steinbeck's imagery.  "Cannery Row in Monterey in California-"  he puts you right there, and... Stanley, what the hell are you doing?!  STANLEY, YOU GO TO YOUR ROOM RIGHT NOW! Go, Stanley!  Ahaha, ahem. Heheh, he, he gets very good grades. Stanley, do you know ''why'' you're being grounded for ten months? Stanley, don't you understand what you are doing?? You were stimulating the dog, Stanley! What came out of him was his... r-Randy?! Sexual education. Haven't you learned that yet? Oh. Look, well, you see, Stanley,... Well, your ''school'' should be teaching this stuff!  Look, our kids are learning sexual things on the street and on television. There's no way we can stop it. The schools have to teach them sexual education at a younger age. What the hell was that? Well, I don't know what got into you kids. You should be ashamed of yourselves.  This whole mess started because we couldn't talk to our boy ourselves.
