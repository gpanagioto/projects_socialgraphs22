Yeah, it a way of keeping people from seeing the real evidence. I know it seems crazy, but 9/11 was pulled off by our own government, so they could gain support for attacking the Middle East. I know it's hard to believe. It's called the False Flag policy. Make it look like the enemy attacked you. Get all your citizens riled up and waving American flags. Then you're free to invade any country you want.  Look into the evidence of 9/11 and you'll see there are a lot of holes in their story. You don't understand! The government controls everything. The media, the corporations, they have the power to do anything they want. Here, look!  Read the labels on these! Go on, read them! We think they came from a government office. It's anthrax. Someday we'll use it as evidence against them. You won't get away with it! People know! Wait. What are you doing? No! You can't do this!  Oh no! Oh no!  No. Please. Pleeease! Don't kill me! I, I just do what they say! I have a family. Please don't kill me!
