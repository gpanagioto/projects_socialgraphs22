Dude, you'd better watch it. The principal's right over there.  Did Cartman just say "shitballs" to the principal? What?  He's faking. You do not have Tourette's Syndrome, fatass! Who cares about saying whatever you-? Grrhh, whatever.   Will you knock it off already?! Don't push me, asshole!  No! Up yours, fatboy! Principal Victoria, there's something you need to know! Cartman's Tourette's isn't real! He's faking!  N-no, I'm just saying that I think- L-look, I was just suggesting that maybe this one person could control what he said, but just didn't, for fun. Dude... Aw, come on! Ah, I was just trying to... just, just in one instance...   I'm sorry.  I'm sorry. I said I'm sorry, you piece of sh-  What's this about you going on live television on Saturday?! Cartman, there are people in the world who really have Tourette's Syndrome. This isn't funny! ...Scotch? You are not going to go on national television and spew a bunch of hate speech about Jewish people! I won't let you do it, Cartman! It's not a game, you derelict! And this isn't Scotch! It's apple juice!  What did you say? You aren't gonna get away with this you ''stupid asshole''!  Tango, this is Foxtrot. Are you in position? You sure you don't wanna back out? All right, then we go with the plan. Just like "To Catch A Predator".  Surprise, fatass! I went online posing as a boy who would have sex with older men, and told them to meet me here. My plan worked perfectly!  Whoa.  What? No, I- I beat you!
