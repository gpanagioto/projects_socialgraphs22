Is this all you brought us here to see? Butters is staying over tonight?  Butters. Don't you think it's a little ''strange'' that Cartman keeps asking you to stay over? I mean, that if-  Dude! No dude, that makes ''you'' gay! You put a guy's wiener in your mouth, that makes ''you'' gay, stupid! Yeah huh! Doesn't matter. You're gay now. No-no wait. I I know how you can reverse it, Cartman. The only way you can cancel it out is to get Butters to put ''your'' wiener in ''his'' mouth. Yeah. Then it cancels out the gay polarity.  ...Idiot. What are you talking about, fatass? You figured that out, huh? Except for us. And all the people we tell. Like what? Well, maybe we will, maybe we won't. Okay. We won't tell anybody as long as you are super nice to us, every day, from now on. Okay, my turn.   Where's what? Let go of me. Knock it off! I don't have your stupid picture. I don't have it. Shut up. Ow! Quit it, dude!  He isn't actually going to show everyone...
