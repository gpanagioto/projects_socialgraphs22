Welcome to Make Your Own Video. All set to rock and roll? Uh, well, it's nine ninety five for a three-minute tape. All right, just come over here and stand in front of the green screen.  What kind of song do you want? You know, I've seen a lot of videos here at the mall, and that was by far the best! Hey, I've got a friend who's interning at a big record label in L.A. I'll send a copy on to him and maybe he'll get the bigwigs to see it.
