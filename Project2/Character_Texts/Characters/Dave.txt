Thanks Tom. Those are some cute, cute kids, except for that last one-he's a little tubby. 
Hi!  You gonna come with us to the fire station, Stan? 
There's a king in Colorado, a young wizard who believes that Sony will have the upper hand if we do not come to his aid.  There's... going to be a war in this small town on Black Friday, and it's all over the news! ...but, this one kid said that he's a wizard, and that Sony is helping- Ok-Okay. 
And Mike, I've just looked at the girl's Twitter accounts and it appears they are sitting out the National Anthem to protest the harassment and trolling they receive on the Internet. 
Do you even know what indigenous means, you freakin' idiot?! 
Not yet. Still workin' on it. You gave me a window from noon to 3 to get it all; it's only 2:45. Yeah. Yeah, I think that's got it.
