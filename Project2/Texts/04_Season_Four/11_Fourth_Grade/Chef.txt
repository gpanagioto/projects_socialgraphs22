What's the problem? You call that a problem? That sounds like heaven to me. Oooo! Call the doctor! Uuuh, Ms. Choksondik, Mr. Garrison had several uuh, eee-motional issues. He was a closet homosexual who hated gay people. Whenever someone asked him if he was gay, he'd go nuts. Some say that on cold nights you can still hear him moanin', "I'm not gaaay! I'm not gaaay!" You know I'm always here to help, Principal Victoria.
