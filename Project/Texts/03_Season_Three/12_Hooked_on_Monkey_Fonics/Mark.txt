"Conscientious." May I have the definition, please? "Conscientious." Could you use it in a sentence, please? "Conscientious." C O N S C I E N T I O U S. It was nice competing against you boys. We will have to do it again sometime. No. I live right over there.  I've lived there all my life. Because I'm home-schooled. My parent teach me. So I stay at home instead of going to school. Right.  Oh my goodness, are you two enemies? Strange, friends would call each other names and fight. Papa? Why can't I go to school with the other boys? But I want to play with the other children. O, how they laugh and play, Papá. I just feel like I should go to public school, if only for a little while. To see what other little boys are like. Please, Papá. Just let me try it for a few days. Hooray! Hey, guys. What's up? The answer is 1492. However, the Americas had already been discovered by many before him, including the Vikings and the Native Americans. And therefore, your question is a charade.  Oh. I promised my father I wouldn't. You mean you would actually duct-tape my entire body to a bench? For what purpose? Oh, dear. Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.  Well, they duct-taped me to a bench. I don't know, mother. It didn't make any sense at all. But I want to go back tomorrow, papá. Please, just give me one more day.   Can I sit here with you? Why do you call Kyle names and laugh at him? Is he not your friend? I see. It's like, you have to mark your territory as a boy. You have to socially find your place.  Ah! Stick and stones may break my bones, but words will never harm me. Huh? Oh, papá. Can I at least go to the dance tomorrow? Alright.  She's upstairs playing Doctor with that Kyle boy.  You're out of control. ''[turns to Kyle] You'' did this to my sister! You made my sister into a slut! I'll kill you!   ...I'm not through with you, bitch!   I know letting your kids out into the world is scary. I know you wish nothing bad would ever happen to us. But bad things will happen, and we have to start learning now how to deal with those things.  Thanks, gaywad.  See ya, papá!
