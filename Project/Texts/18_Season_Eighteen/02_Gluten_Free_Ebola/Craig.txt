What are you guys doing here? But you told us all to go fuck ourselves.  You told us your company was gonna make $10 million, and the rest of us could go fuck ourselves. Are you guys making this up? All the pizza we can eat? All right, this better be good. You call this a party?! Your party sucks! I knew you guys were going to bail on the party. Uh huh, you guys couldn't get Lorde to play, could you?  Well, I gotta admit, you guys throw a pretty sweet party.
