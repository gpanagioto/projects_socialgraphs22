Dude, have you seen my parents?  He was a McCain supporter.  It's okay, Ike. Obama will do fine. Yes, ah I'm trying to locate my parents. M-my name is Kyle Broflovski. Yes, I know Obama won. What?! Oh my God!  Ike, don't do it! There's still so much to live for!  Really Ike, that's like five feet off the ground. Don't do it. Ike?  Oh crap Ike?  Hang in there, Ike. We're gonna get you help. Hey, excuse me, but we need some help. No, we don't want to enter any of your stupid shelter! We NEED a ride to the hospital! We made it, Ike. You're going to be okay.   E-excuse me, my little brother needs medical attention. Ma'am, please, I think my little brother needs immediate help. What the hell?  Ike?
