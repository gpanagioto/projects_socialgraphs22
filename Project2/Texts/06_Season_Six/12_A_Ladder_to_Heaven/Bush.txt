Alright, how's the ladder going, General? Are we beating the Japanese? Saddam Hussein? But... we killed him! We secretly took him out months ago! Dear Christ, that sonofabitch just doesn't stop! That tricky bastard! Ladies and gentlemen of the UN, we have evidence that Saddam Hussein is up there building weapons of mass destruction.  We have tried to communicate with Saddam through a psychic to ask him to let us see his warehouses in heaven. But ''he'' has ''not'' "re-spond-ed". Right. Dead, and in heaven. Our intelligence tells us that when Saddam was originally killed, his soul actually went to hell. But while in hell he began a homosexual relationship with Satan, the Prince of Darkness. Satan, however, decided he didn't want to be with Hussein anymore and broke up with him around August.  Yes? I assure you, I am not high. Good. As soon as the boys finish their ladder we'll be ready to take Saddam out.  And I was dumb enough to believe Saddam could actually be up there buildin' bombs.
