 Yeah. Oh, what do you want now?! Hurry up! Ah! Dude, what the fuck? I'm going to the bathroom! Why?  I have to stay with my group, Cartman. What is? What is all this? Wow, that's pretty smart. You mean like one of the teachers? Are you sure? Emoji analysis, it's genius! She wasn't being funny. I don't! Cartman,  I did some research on the Danish Web site you've been helping out. You do realize that once TrollTrace is online, anybody can use it on anyone, right? So somebody, like Heidi, could use it to see ''your'' entire Internet history. Everything you ever said and did on the Internet, even before you were together. Right, but somebody, like me, could look up your entire Internet history, print it out, and give it to Heidi. I would imagine there's some things you've done or said on the Internet you wouldn't want Heidi to know about. It's available to everyone, stupid!
