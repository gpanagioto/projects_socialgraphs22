Dude, don't be nervous. You're the best player at our school, dude. You'll make the team for sure. Good luck.  Dude, you were awesome, Kyle.  Kyle, you have to cheer up, dude. So you aren't built right for basketball. Wha-a-a negroplasty?? Uh excuse me, is this really a good idea? What? Jesus Christ, dude! Dude, is Kyle's- dad a- dolphin?  Kyle went down to play in the basketball game, Mrs. Garrison. What?! But you made him into a basketball player. Oh Jesus, he's about to play!  Kyle, NO!  Yeah, that's basically it.
