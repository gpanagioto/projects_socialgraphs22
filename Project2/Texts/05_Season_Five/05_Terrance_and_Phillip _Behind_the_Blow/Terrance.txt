Why, did you fart?  Sure, buddy! All you need to do is go down to the  get to the auto garage! Sure. You go the same way  except stick your finger up your ass. OOOH! Sure! Just stick your finger up ''my'' ass.  You're ''at'' the auto garage. I ''am'' the mechanic. Because I had an itch up my ass.  Terrance & Phillip will be right back...  How are we all feeling tonight? Pretty good? Uh oh. [Terrance farts and the audience claps awkwardly] Hey, do you all remember this one? "Doctor, doctor. I think I cracked my ass." "Reallih? Let me take a look." "Look closer." [farts, and laughs]   Hello Phillip. Say, Phillip, I have a question for you. And now here's a classic Terrance and Phillip sketch that I wrote back in '62.  He sure did. Who. Who! Who passed gas! That's the man's name? Yes! Right, the guy that drank his own urine. Mmm. Mmm, yummy.  We sure did, baby.  You're a huge fan alright! But what do I get in return? Oh yeah.  Oh, that's good, baby. You like that?  Yeah. Ah good. Yeah- Jesus Christ! That was fast! Well, what should we name it? How about Jerry? Oh wow! We had quadruplets!  Oh! Thank God. The last thing I need is more kids.  What do you want, an autograph or something? Earth Day, huh? That sounds like a very noble cause. How much does it pay?  Who? Why is it that every time somebody sees me they have to say, "Hey, where's Phillip?" Like we're freaking married or something! You know, I'll let you tater-tots in on a little secret: Phillip is a HACK!  You know who wrote all the Terrance and Phillip stuff? ME! Phillip never did anything but read his lines! Ah, I know.  To be honest, things haven't been going so well lately. I'm not making any money because everyone wants to see Phillip. Why? What the hell does Phillip do? Ogh, whatever.  And apparently, so is the act. And so is the money. HA! Goood luck getting Phillip! He left because he wanted to do  "more serious" stuff. Last I heard, he was doing Canadian Shakespeare in Toronto. Well, in that case, I'd say you four boys are up Fart Creek without a paddle.  Alright, I'm here. Where do I-? My doing?? These kids called me and said it was your idea and that you wanted to apologize. Ditto! Doctor, doctor, I've cracked my ass. Look closer.   Uh. What? That's not the line, asshole! ''Just'' do the bit ''right'', dickface! I may be ''fat'' but at least I didn't get hair plugs! I never needed you in the first place, yuh hack!  Here's a missile for ya!  I don't know, Phillip. It looks like the alien species here breathe an inert gas.  Oh, Phillip. You're still here, too.  Me neither. We sure did. No. No, Phillip, don't say it. I was an asshole, and this is mostly ''my'' fault. No, Phillip, I really thought I did everything. Until I- tried to do it alone.  Thank you everyone, thank you! You know, Phillip and I have learned an important lesson: that when you go through a lot with somebody, you can't let trite things come between you. Ohohoho, nohoho!  He sure did, Phillip.
