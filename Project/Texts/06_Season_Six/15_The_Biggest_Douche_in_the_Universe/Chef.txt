Hello there, children. Well what's wrong with him? Children, why didn't you tell me about this sooner? Well, you should. Cartman is your friend whether you like him or not! Now, come on! We've gotta get to that hospital! Cartman?  Oh my God! Eric, how long have you been channelin' Kenny? Kenny? Kenny, do you know what you need to get free? Ms. Cartman, we need to get Eric to a medium who can speak with people who have crossed over. This hospital isn't gonna do any good. We need to take him to see John Edward. That's right. We have to go see him in New York. Good. You children need to come too. Eric needs all the support he can get right now. This must be the place. Don't worry, Eric. I'm sure he will be able to help you. Look uh, Mr. Edward, can you just ask Kenny how we can get him out, please? Aw man, I can't believe I got fooled by that asshole! Yeah. They must edit his shows down on television to only show him getting mostly right answers. We've got no choice. The only people I know now who might be able to help Eric are my parents. We'll have to take the next flight to Scotland.  Okay children, this is your flight back to Colorado. Your parents are meeting you at the airport in Denver. Come on, we gotta catch our plane. You children get right on that plane now. Hi Pop. These are my friends, the Cartmans.  Hi, Momma!  Mom, this is my friend, Ms. Cartman. Yeah, Pop. This is Eric. Just stay still, Eric. Mom knows what she's doing. The victim child? Where were we gonna find a child to sacrifice? What do we do with it now? Eric, you're okay!  Well, come on. We'd better get Kenny back to his parents. Wait a minute. Who's got the pot roast? Aw, damnit! Come on!  We've gotta find him! Kenny!
