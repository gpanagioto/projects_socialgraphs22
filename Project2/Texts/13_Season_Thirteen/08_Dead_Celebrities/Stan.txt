Dude, I don't even know who that is. Are you guys fucking serious? It's gonna be alright, Kyle. Dude, I don't understand at all. I eat Chipotle all the time and it never made me crap blood. Whoa whoa wait, there really are ghosts? Uh oh. You're dead, Mr. Jackson! Accept it!  Mr. Jackson, you can't do this! This is not your body! Alright, let's see: demonic ghosts, animal ghosts... ...setting traps for ghosts, no... Here here here it is: possession by a ghost. A ghost that enters and then refuses to leave a living host has done so because it failed in the living world to be what it wanted to be. The ghost must be allowed to transform and be recognized by the living as what it always tried to be. So he wants to finally be accepted by the living as a little white girl. Yeahhhh!  Excuse me, uh, if you could do us a favor and pleeease just vote for little Miss Jackson? It's really important. Dude, the two male judges love her. Yeah, there's no way that lady judge is voting for us. She was glaring the entire time. Woohoo!
