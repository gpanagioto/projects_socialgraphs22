How are you doing? Here, I made you powdered donut pancake surprise. You're not fat, you're big boned. You can have an eensy weensy bit, can't you? Just a weensy eensy woo woo? How about a nice chocolate chicken pot pie, then? Yes, hon? Sure, hon. You want some Cheesy Poofs, too? Well, then. I know a certain kitty-kitty who's sleeping with Mommy tonight! Eric, look who's here. That's okay, Eric, I think you need to go spend time with your little friends.  Don't be difficult, Eric! Now, you go out and play in the fun snow. 
Okay Eric, I'll get you some at the store tomorrow. But tomorrow is grocery day Eric. Okay, okay, then. I guess I'll be going to the store now then. 
Now you be careful, Eric. The woods can be very dangerous. Here hon, I packed you some cheesy poofs and happy tarts. Be sure to use lots of bug spray, and if you have to poo-poo, don't wipe with poison ivy. And I know it can get scary up in those woods, but just remember, mommy's not far away. You give your mommy a kissy. Scuzzlebutt saved the day. 
Eric dear? I just got a call from your friend Kyle's mother. She said that this show is naughty, and might make you a potty mouth. Ohhh, okay hon. Hehh, it doesn't look like our protest is working. Ohho, Carol, where are the Porto-Potties?  Ohhh, yes, indeedy. 
Hello there! Happy Halloween! 
Would you boys like some Cheesy Poofs? Sure hon.  Not yet hon. Yes hon? Sure, hon. You want some more Cheesy Poofs hon? Okay. 
Come on, kiddies. Eat more. Mmmmm. More pie, hon? 
Hello, boys. Ooooh, he's just been feeling under the weather. Maybe you boys can cheer him up. He's in the backyard. How is your beefy roast, snookums? Sure, hon. Uh huuuh. Yyeess?? Well, what's your question, hon? Oooooohh. Ooohh, hhmmm . Wwell - yyou see, Eric, sometimes when a man and a woman are... attracted to each other, they want to be... close to each other. And sometimes the man puts his who-who-dilly in the woman's cha-cha. Eric, the day I met your father it was like - magic! It was a beautiful autumn night when the aspen trees were turning, at the Twelfth Annual Drunken Barn Dance. I was young and naive then... And then I saw ''him''. He was the most beautiful, charming piece of ass I'd ever seen in South Park. His name... was Chief Running Water.  I don't recall exactly how the rest of the night went, but the next morning I was pregnant with you, my little blueberry muffin. Oh I never saw him after that. Ah-I wasn't really that interested in him. I heard he still lives on the Ute reservation just outside of town. 
I want to have... an abortion. Cartman. Yesuh- it's such a hard decision, but I just don't feel I can raise a child in this screwy world. About eight years ago. Eight years old. Really? But I just don't think I'm a fit mother. Well, I think you need to keep ''your laws'' off of ''my body''.  Well, that's exactly what I intend to do. Good day! ...And so you see, Congressman O'Reilly, that's why I think abortion laws should be changed. But the person at Unplanned Parenthood said you were who I had to talk to about changing the law. Oh, dear. Don't you see, Governor? I should have a right to have an abortion if I want one. I mean, what right do I have bringing another child into this overpopulated world? Then again, I should've thought of that before having sex. then againuh-- Oh, I just don't know...  Oh, thank you, ''thank'' you.  Terminated? Oh no uh- I didn't mean that. I meant the ''other'' thing you can do-what's that other A word? Yess, that's what I mean. Adoption. Oh, I should tell my son the truth about everything myself. Good day, Mr. President.  Yes, it's true. It's true. I'm sorry I never told you, Eric. I just thought, maybe it would be a little shocking to you. 
Hello? Oh yes, Sharon. How are you? Hu-old on, dear, let me check. Hon, I made beefy logs. I made Cookie Dings. No, he's not here. Oh, dear! Ah-are you okay, hon? Oh. Well. Would you like some beetles for breakfast? Mmmm. Mmmm. Beetles are good with ice cream. 
I guess it's much better to get it when you're young. Oh, yes. When I was a child, my mother had me go over to a little girl's house who had the chickenpox, just so I would get it. Don't scratch it, hon. ''No'', hon. Here, I got you some calamine lotion. It'll make your itches go away. Not too much, hon. It says on the bottle that too much can be bad.  I'm back, hon. I got some more calamine lotion. Just use a little bit of that stuff, hon. It has to last a while. Ooh, I have them somewhere else, poopiekins. What's that, Eric? 
Don't pick your nose, hon. Don't be nervous. I'm sure you'll win. Hello, everybody.  Now, just do it like we rehearsed, hon. Thank you. Don't pick your nose, hon. Oohh, you look great, hon. Mommy's fat little piggy. Oh wait, wait. You've got a little eye booger, hon. Got it.  Don't pick your nose, hon. 
 How's the treehouse coming along, hon? Sorry, hon. Well, I don't know, Eric. If you did that, then the floors would be bare. Well, all right. Eric, snookums! it's time for Mommy to tuck you into your snuggleboat for night-night. Eric, are you out there in your clubhouse? 
Oh, it's my pleasure. Eric loves his little friends. Around six hours. Well, I've got an idea. We could sing. ''Over the meadow and through the woods'' Ooo, careful hon. These roads are bumpy. Here we go, kids. We're crossing the state line into Nebraska.  Wheat. The building block of your favorite foods, and, Nebraska's principal source of economic productivity. You see, when Nebraska first became-- That shouldn't be a problem. Eric's Grandma is right near the mall. About another hour, hon. Now, Eric, let's try to get out of that grumpy mood before we get to Grandma's.''<br />   Hello everyone. Happy Holidays! These are Eric's friends: Stan, Kyle, and Kenny. Boys, let me introduce you to the Cartman family. This is Uncle Stinky. Aunt Lisa, Cousin Fred, Cousin Alexandra  No, no, Florence, that's not Eric.  Ooh, I'm sorry to hear that, Stanley. Here, Kyle. Will you hold Great-Grandma's catheter bag during dinner?   Great-grandma has a bladder problem. This helps her out.  Eric, did you say 'hi' to your little cousin Elvin? Hi, Howard. Hello? Oh, why yes he did. I thought you were dead, Sharon. Stanley told me you had passed on. I'm glad to see that you're better. 
Oh, hello boys. Have you seen Eric around anywhere? Oh, all right. I was just at the store buying some apples. Yes. Apples.  Stinky apples. See you, boys.   
You have to see the eye doctor, Eric. You're not fat, you're big-boned. There you are, Eric! Come on, we have to go to the eye doctor. Come on. Do you want your laser corrective surgery or not? Now, hon.  
 I'll think about it, hon. Mommy's busy, boopie-kins.  Go ahead, snookums. It's probably one of your little friends.  That's nice, muffin. Oh, Eric dear. It's what's best. Eric, this is for the best.  Eric, it's important for you to understand-. 
 The babysitter's here. Come on downstairs. I have to leave soon, Eric. Come down as soon as you're done.  Thank you so much for babysitting little Eric, Shelly. All those other babysitters won't come back. Oh, that sounds fine. I'm going to a meteor shower party. The number where I'll be is on the refrigerator. Eric's nookie time is 9 o'clock sharp. If his little woogums get cold, you can turn up the heat over here. And if he gets cranky, just play tummy-rub-rubs with him, and make sure he wipes good after he makes bears. Oh! And don't mind the cat. She's just being loud because she's in heat.  Okay, muffin. Mommy's leaving now. You do what the babysitter tells you, okay? Be good. Come give Mommy Eskimo kisses!  Eskimo kisses for Mom-my! Bye, kids.  No no no, that's impossible, hon. I told her: no visitors. This party is very loud, boopy-kins. You'll have to speak up. Not really, hon.  Oh! Oh, Mr. Mackey!  Hi, kids. I'm home.  
 Eric, your little friends are here. E-heric, it's only Halloween. I'm sorry, hon, Oh, that's not funny, boys. Eric isn't fat, he's big-boned. 
Eric, calm down.  What is it, Eric?  I'm making you some lunch right now, Eric. Can't it wait till tomorrow, hon? Alright! let's go.  They're so strange. Where are they from? Well, I'm letting Eric go to the camp. I mean, it seems to me this Chinpokomon thing is just another harmless fad. You have? Come on, Eric. Let's try to battle your Roostor with my Donkeytron. 
 Eric, Mommy got you a present! Nnno, I got you something that's going to help you win the big spelling bee tomorrow. This year is gonna be different. Look!  It's a new way to learn how to read and spell. And it comes with everything you need to help win that spelling bee.   Hon, are you ready for some math problems? Oh, all right.  Yes? Sure, hon.   Eric, I got you a new history textbook. Why don't you come downstairs. Eric, please. We have to do some studying today. 
What is it, snookums? Oh my! She must think that you are a very special little muffin. Don't say "tits," Eric. Well, then, now you should take that money and open up a savings account that has compounded daily interest. But Eric, I think maybe the tooth fairy wants you to use that money to learn about saving. ''Tucky tucky time, it's the best time of the night.'' No, honey, Mommy's gotta save her throat. I have to work tonight. Good night.  What do you have there, Eric? Oh, my. The tooth fairy will have to give you a big surprise for losing two teeth in two days. Oh. Eh-hello, Dr. Roberts? It's Ms. Cartman. Well, it's my son. He's lost a lot of his baby teeth, and I was starting to get worried. About a hundred and twelve. Yes. Fifteen of them in one night. Perhaps he should switch toothpaste? O-oh, thank you. Freebie next week.   Yes, Eric Oh. Eric, poopie, sit down.  Mommy has something to tell you. It's just that- well, there is no tooth fairy, Eric. I've been putting all that money under your pillow, and because you got so many teeth fall out, I've actually run out of money and can't go to the grocery store for at least a month. I'm sorry, Eric. All children find out sooner or later. No, honey. It's just- Oh, Eric, it's just part of being a child. Eric! Eric, wait! 
Eric, don't you realize you could've seriously injured your little friend? Don't apologize to us, apologize to him! Oh my goodness.  Oo, poopiekins? 
Yes. Mr. Pharmacist, this Ritalin doesn't have any side effects, does it? Alright. Oh my. 
Oh, don't they look precious? Eric, sshhhh.  
 Ooh, sweetums, did you laugh too hard again? Well, some more of your little friends are here to play with you.   Isn't that funny, sweetie? 
''You ''have'' been bad, so you're gonna have to drink from this glass. [points to it, then spreads her legs and pisses into it as he watches]'' 
 Hello, kiddies. I made you all powdered doughnut pancake surprise. What? Oh. Well,  alrighty then. I... don't think it worked.  Eric, Sister Anne has come to visit you. 
Right, because it will hybrid with all those other processors and generate a whole new era of technological darkness. Well, I certainly won't buy him anymore, then... Bill.  In his room. But, why don't I show you the rest of the house first?  Come this way, Billy.   Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah! 
Boopsie-kins, It's late. You need to be in bed. Now, hon! Twenty more minutes, and that's it.  
Eh yes, sweetie. Oohh, honey, why don't you make it yourself?  some company. Uh, sweetie, your friends wanted to have a "talk" with you. Your friends and I have all chipped in and we're going to send you up to a weight-management retreat. Oh, sweetie, those were all lies. You're just fat.  ...And it has basketball courts and tennis courts, and you can call Mommy any time you want.  Yes. I'm afraid he's a little moody. Oh.  Well, goodbye, sweetie. Thanks for coming, everybody. Oh, no. Quite the contrary. Eric showed up and surprised me last night. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to present to you... the new Eric Cartman.  Believe it. He lost 40 pounds at his fat camp.  I made some healthy tofu pudding to celebrate. Who wants some? 
 We've learned to overcome it, son. You'll see. 
Ssshhh, pumpkin, it's almost over. No, sweetie, we have to tend to some of Grandma's business. In a minute, sweetie. This is important. A million dollars? Oh my. Are you sure this is what you want, sweetie? 
Do you see that, Sheila? The Williamses are shopping here. 
 Sweetie, your friends are downstairs. They need to see you. They say it's an emergency. 
Yes, sweetie? What's that, my little man? Hmmm. but you're not out of control, muffin. You're my perfect little gum drop. Of course I do. Sweetie, don't. I'm glad you're not like that, poopsie-kins. Oh, my little poopsie-kins gets into no-nos once in a while, but he's still my perfect little plumsy-kiddle. Oh, he's such a cutie. Ooo, he loves playing with his Clyde Frog and Wellington Bear. Oh, I mean, sex and drugs. 
Oh, but my poor little poopsie must be getting so hungry. Maybe we should get them a little food. Oh, all right. Oh, I just can't stand to see my baby suffer. 
 
Oh, hello boys. Oh, but I thought your teacher died. Oh. Well, I'll tell Eric. He's just down in the basement playing with his dolls.  Sweetie. You have to get ready for school. Yes, but they said two weeks off was enough, and they want everyone back. You'll get over it, honey. 
What's going on? I heard an explosion. 
 
Well, Sheila, we can't shelter our boys forever from these things. Maybe it's okay for them to see an adult film. 
Me too. 
 Be careful with my baby.  You're going to be okay, baby. Is he going to be okay? Doctor! Did you find out what's wrong with him?  Why?? What's wrong with him?? Well, what does he need? What can we do?  It's going to be okay, baby. We're going to get you more time. He's looking a little better today. Oooh, what should I do? I'm playing roulette with my child's life!  Ooo wait, Hairspray is showing in New York, isn't it? Let's go there. Eric?  It must be his time. I think it's running out! It's too far and your parents want you back home. Hang in there, sweetie. We'll be there soon. Please, call me Liane. Oh dear. Get it down. Oh, baby, your time is back! Oh it's so good to have you acting like yourself again, sweetie. I thought ''you'' got it. 
He's an inspiration to us all. 
 Is he going to be all right, doctor??  Oh baby baby, you can't die. Whoa. Easy, Kyle. I know you're in a very dark place now, sweetie. But you must come toward the light! Come toward the light! 
What's the matter, sweetie? Oh dear. Come on, sweetie. Doctor says you need to get home and get lots of rest.  What is it, sweetie? Oooo, looks like the tooth fairy was extra-happy with you. 
Boys, you have a little visitor.  Eric, where have you been? It's ten thirty. Well you should've called Mommy. Well, why don't you get ready for snoogums' night-night, and I'll bring you some toasty chocolate nummers? 
Eric, you've done a lot of horrible things in your life, but smoking? You're grounded for three weeks! Oh my goodness, I had no idea.  Are you okay, sweetie? You too, Eric. 
That's a great idea, Chef. 
Yes, hon?  What's that, hon? Oh... N- no, sweetie. I believe those Olympics are just for... "special" children. You are, hon, but... I don't think that's a very good idea.  ...I'm sorry, Eric. The answer is No.  Oh, a- a- all right, sweetie, I- I'll take you tomorrow. Hello. Um, I would like to... sign my son up, please. Eric Cartman... He's nine. ...Um, he's retarded.  Ohhh, oh. I'm not sure.  Sweetie, what is your condition? 
Eric, sweetie, there's a bunch of people showing up in our backyard saying something about a meeting? Oh, that's great, sweetie. Okay, hon. 
Oh, I'm so glad to hear it, Mrs. Stotch. Eric has been having some emotional problems lately. Oh, well, I'm not sure. Actually, Eric is still supposed to be grounded for trying to exterminate the Jews two weeks ago. Oh, but I suppose it would be good for him. Yes, of course he can go. I'll bring some of clothes over. 
Oh my God! Eric! Eric,  Oh, what's wrong with him? Coma... My God, fo- for how long?  Oh, you've finally come back! It's a miracle! You're doing so much better, muffin. Oh, you're sounding just like your old self again. His new... powers? Oh, he will. My little poopsiekins is a very good little boy. Eric, sweetie, there's um, some people here to see you. Ah, no, these people claim that they are the "real" psychic detectives.  Oooh, I'll go make some tea. Oh, goodness! What's going on? O-o-o-o-oh!  Is it over?  
 Oh, Poopie-kins, it's very early.  Sweetie, can't we go after school? 
Oh, you've been so helpful, I uh, just don't know how to thank you. Ohoho, nhn. Yes?  Oh hi. Oh, what is it?  Oh, that's so nice. Oh, that's so sweet.  
That's my little boy.  
Eric honey, time to get up for school.   AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! Oh my God! Eric! You mean... Oh...  Oh ye-yes, of course,sweetie. 
Eric, why would you do such a thing? That's very naughty, Eric.  He just never listens. It's not him, it's ''you'', Eric.  I don't know what to do with you.  Yes. I think it's the nanny, poopsiekins. Oh, thank you so much for coming. Please come in.  All, all right dear.  Yeah, it's best to avoid his level. Eric, naughty. Oh, but we really need some help.  What do you mean? Oh dear. I don't know what else to do about my son's behavioral problems. We've been through every nanny reality show on television. Please, come in. Well, he's just... out of control. I mean, he never listens to me, and he pretty much runs my life. What what is it that you're doing? Oh, that's very interesting. Well, no, I don't.  Ahall right.  Tsst. It doesn't seem to work as well when I do it. Oh, very good, sweetie. Wow, I have a lot to learn. Oh dear.  But what if he ''does'' run away? Oh Eric, I'm so happy you're home. Look what I did, Eric. I learned how to make Sumie paintings. I had almost forgotten how artistic I was. Cesar... Yup, just like you said he would. He said he's hungry. What should I do? Eric, if you don't want to eat then, why don't you go brush your teeth and go to bed?!  Tsst.   Tsst.   Tsst.  Oh... Oh my gosh! He's never done this before. I love you very much, poopsiekins. You're Mommy's sunshine.  Eric, I want you to go upstairs and brush your teeth. Then I'll be up to read you a story before bed.  Oh my goodness. I can't believe it. I am the pack leader!  Sounds divine! Oh, he's been amazing, Cesar. He got an A on his last spelling test and a B+ in history. He's losing weight and he's doing what I tell him. The best part is I'm not letting him boss me around anymore. I could have ''never'' come out and have a nice lunch on a Saturday afternoon with a friend before. There's just one problem: he still fights me every step of the way. I feel like he's ''doing'' what I tell him, but that inside he's still the same angry spoiled child. Oh Cesar, I'm so happy to have you in my life.  Why Eric, you made your own breakfast. And you're studying before school?  Oh, Eric. I'm very proud of you. I love you, sweetie. Cesar. I'm so happy you're back. Oh, he's amazing. I think the change in personality happened. He's doing things for himself now, and he seems to be accepting it. I've lost a best friend, but I've gained a son. You're the best, Cesar, and to show my gratitude I've got two tickets for you and me to see ''Madame Butterfly'' this Friday night. Oh... But I thought we were becoming friends. Eric, how would you like to go with me to see ''Madame Butterfly'' Friday night? Well, what if I took you to Kentucky Fried Chicken afterward?  And then we'll go to Target and buy you a Mega Ranger.  
Yes hon?  What hon? Oohh, that's a big boy, isn't he?  
There you are, Eric. What are you doing here? When does it come out?  It's time for school. Eric, you're just going to have to be patient.  Eric, you're coming home right now! It's almost bedtime. If you sleep then time'll go by faster.  Whoa! Eric, get out of there.   You need to learn to be patient! 
There you are, Eric. Eric, you have to come home. You can't just wait here for that game to come out. But, honey, it's only September. That...  Nintendo Wii doesn't come out for two months. Who are you talking to, muffin? 
 Sweetie, shhh, tell Mommy what happened. Oh, now why would he do that? What ''is'' the picture of, Eric?  Ohh, that's nice. Oh, there there, sweetie. It'll be okay. These things happen. It's okay, Eric. I'll have a talk with Kyle's mother. Hello, Sheila? It's Liane, Eric's mother. Um, Sheila, I'm sorry to trouble you with this, but apparently your son has a picture of Eric with another boy's penis in his mouth. Don't worry, sweetie, everything is fine. You have nothing to worry about in school tomorrow. Mrs. Broflovski assured me that Kyle doesn't have the picture. She talked with her son and says he doesn't have it. She said she was sure, Eric. Well, Eric, there's nothing more I can do about it. 
It started about four days ago, Doctor, and every day he seems to get worse. Oh... Oh dear... I was checking out the Internet and ih, it almost seems like his symptoms are like those in something called "Tour, Tourette's Syndrome"? Oh Doctor, can you help him? Is there a problem, sweetie? 
Uh, what exactly does that entail, doctor? What do you say, champ? Think you can tough it out? Poopsiekins, wake up. Wake up, honey. That's right, you did it, Poopsiekins! I'm so proud of you, Eric. Oh, here's the doctors now! Hi, doctor. ...What!? Oh, my poor little baby! Oh God!  Oh no!  Oh, oh, my baby has HIV! Excuse me, shouldn't we wait for everyone to arrive before we get started? Ohoho poopsiekins, be nice. 
 Eric? Sweetie, are you having nightmares about the Chinese again?  Sweetiekins, are you all right?  No, sweetie, the Chinese aren't going to get you. 
Oh no, thank you so much for your time.  You're very sweet. Thank you again. Come on, muffin.  
You all right, sweetie? What's going on? Oh dear. 
Oh, hello sweetie. What did you do today?  Aww, what happened, hun? 
The KFC in Salida is a long way away, sweetie. Be patient. Eric, we're almost to Frisco. Why don't we go to the Church's Fried Chicken there? Alright honey, let's take it easy. 
Please, leave my boy alone! No please! 
Ohh, it's a little late, sweetie. Why don't you boys just keep playing downstairs? Well, all right.  All right, are you little munchkins buckled up for safety?  Eric, what have we talked about with that language?! One more time and I'm not taking you anywhere!  No- Eric, stay in the car, sweetie!  Eric, poopsie? Sweetie, let the nice firemen do their job. Yes, Mysterion?  Eric, I talked to you about beating up your friends, didn't I? Eric, you do not beat up your friends! And I told you I've had it with your language!  Your punishment is that your friends will just play superheroes without you! Go to your room! 
 Eric Cartman! Where have you been, young man?! Yes they are, but you were supposed to be grounded in your room! And now you're more grounded, young man! Eric, are you listening to me?!  What? What do you mean "what should-"  
My little sunshine has a temper sometimes, but he's not all bad. 
 Here you go, sweetie. Yes. Every time somebody gets a birthday present Eric gets one too.  Otherwise, he gets a little upset. Here you are, muffin.  
 Eric, you wanna say hi to Grandpa? 
No, sweetie, I've been at the hair salon. Why? Are you sure, sweetie? But who would want to s- What? Eric, sweetie, is everything okay?  Uh sweetie, I see that you're a little... disturbed right now, but, maybe you can- No, Rumpertumskin, I didn't. I swear. Sweetie, you really can just talk to me if you- Eric, I promise you, I didn't do ''anything'' to your favorite toy. Whoever did this to you, I hate them as much as you do, and I'd do anything to get to the bottom of it. Thank you so much for allowing Eric and I to stay here. I asked little Eric where he would feel safest, and he said with his friend Tolkien.  
What hon? Uhoh, Thanksgiving's still a couple of weeks away, sweetie. I haven't gone shoppies yet. What is it, hon? 
Hi, sweetie.  What, hon? Eric, I'm working two jobs. Mommy's doing everything she can. Well, we're in a tough economy, Eric. I don't know what else you want me to do about it. Eric, we aren't that much poorer than most people. Oh.  Oh, oh, my goodness no. I haven't used drugs in quite a while. Oh. Ah, I'm white trash and I'm in trouble. 
The what? Oh sure.  It's the Toilet Safety Administration, hun. They're gonna do something to the potty. Oh. Safety belt? 
 Everything okay, sweetie? 
Oh, I'm sorry, but I really don't think I can afford this. Ohhh... 
 Sweetie, there's a Mr. Pun Li Tsiao on the phone for you?  Oh my goodness, what's going on? Oh, I've told him to respect people's property. What did he take?  Oh well, no TV for him for a few days. 
Eric, honey, what's the matter? I know that the NSA is torturing Santa, sweetie. But they're keeping us safe. Honey, it's okay. No, you don't have to fly to Russia, hon. No, it will be fine. How about I make you some hot tea with lemon and codeine? Okay, hon. 
 Sweetie, Bill Gates is on the phone for you. 
Eric? Poopsiekins?  
Oh, are you having a party sweetheart? Oh, how fun! I'm going, honey. Oh yes, sweetie, I think quite a few people are Yelp reviewers. I guess so, honey. Do you need more lemonade? 
Oh my, how beautiful.  Oh, look, sweetie, someone sent you flowers. Who are they from, hon? Awww. 
Eric Cartman, I told you to get ready for bed! No, Eric! This is a school night! You most certainly are! Right now, mister! Eric, where did you get that? Eric, you march right up to your room, and you- Eric, you get your butt to bed!  I told you to go upstairs right now! I'm not going to tell you again, Eric! It is time... for night-night!  I am your mother, and you will do what I tell you! Well then, you go right now, Mister!  Alright then. No comic books, just straight to sleep! I love you, sweetie.  
Did you like the movie, hon? 
 Oh hi, poopsie. Oh, y-yes sweetie. Uh, we had to get rid of Alexa. Oh, i-it's okay, sweetie, we have Jim Bob now. It works the same and makes sure people don't lose their jobs. Jim Bob, what time is it? Oh, Mommy's gotta run, sweetie. I've got a doctor's appointment. Jim Bob, how's the traffic to town? Okay,  you want some music, hon? Jim Bob, play Kendrick Lamar. Oh, he is, sweetie, but I can't get him to come out of his room.  Oh, I think I can remember all that, yes. 
Oh yes, my little Eric just loves the pumpkin patch. It's one of his favorite events of the year. All right, you kids all ready? Eric, potty mouth. 
Yes, hon? 
 Eric, I just feel like you have so much to offer the world, and it kills me that you're so afraid to let your inner you shine. 
Mornin' hon. I don't think anyone's getting packages, sweetie. Look.  
Eric, you have to be a big boy. Good boy, Eric!  I'm sorry, PC Principal. It's just that my little Eric really doesn't like shots. No no, you don't understand. I-I've taken him to the doctor every Friday for the past four years. They try to give him his shot, but he gets scared and runs around. and he squeals like a little pig. The doctors try to catch him, but Eric greases himself up so they can't.  Please! I've tried everything! You have to let Eric go to school! I work all day, and without school, he'll just... he'll just have nothing! Ih- if you could offer Eric something. Uhm, sometimes when Eric behaves this way, I think of a gift or a treat of some kind. I don't know. Oh, w-would that be possible? Eric, you really have to do it this time, okay? When we're at the doctor's you can't change your mind.  Come on, Eric, we're going home!    ''One toy'', Eric! I'm sorry. It's just my strong, personal belief that  "among other things, vaccines contain harmful ingredients formaldehyde, aluminum, and even mercury." Yes, yes, I know, but...  "We can't even risk a 0.1% chance of vaccinations making our children artistic."  You try it! Don't you people criticize me until you've taken Eric to the doctor and you've tried to hold him down! I'm a good mother! Don't you dare question if I care about my child!  You don't understand how hard it is! [coming down the stairs] Oh, I don't know if I can go through with this. My little Eric is going to be so mad at me! Did you bring his boo-boo present? Eric, there's a big treat for you if you stay still! Eric! Oh!  Oh, Eric. I... wasn't sure if you'd be up yet.  Eric, you know I only want what's best for my snookums. It was supposed to make it easier on you, a-and they didn't catch you anyway. Eric, please! You don't know how hard it is to be a parent! Sometimes we don't know the right thing to do! Eric, when I was at the store, I bought you some Little Debbie creme pies and- Sweetie, you can't live on your own. Hello, Randy. I'm... sorry to trouble you, but... I don't know where to turn. I was hoping maybe... I could buy some gumdrops. My son.. hates me. The whole town... hates me. Nobody thinks I'm a good mom,  and I don't know if I am anymore! It all happened gradually, you know?  I know immunizations are probably for the best,  and, I don't know, it's scary. It doesn't matter. They're having an all-county mandated immunization roundup tonight. Any child not immunized is about to be. I know, Randy. Other parents expect me to deal with Eric- ...I understand. Yes, I do. Randy, we both tried to do the best for our family.  And sometimes, when we're afraid of being judged, we can push our family away. You should just feel lucky that you have a partner in doing what's right for your family. Thanks for the talk, Randy. And for the weed. [turns and goes to the barn entrance.]   Get out of my way! Move it! Leave my son a  AHHHH!   No, Eric! No shots, no toy!  Eric... 
You must have something you can give us. This can't be happening.  
 Eric, aren't you supposed to be on your Zoom call? Sweetie, I know these are challenging times. But we all still have to try and do our work. I at least need you to get some of your homework done, okay? And then m-maybe take a shower. Sweetie, it's all going to be over soon. They're actually talking about school opening up again in a few days!  There's going to be a big meeting. Sounds like they're trying to get you, kids, back in school! But they're talking about maybe staggering you kids every other day. Eric, you're going to be able to be with all the other kids again!  Eric, you can't- 
 it's okay! What's wrong?! Shh! Eric! Eric, it's okay, sweetie. Shh. Uh, yes, I understand that you told my child that he isn't allowed to wear pajamas this Friday? What is this, Nazi Germany? Well, I'm sorry, but I don't think it's safe for Eric to not wear his pajamas on pajama day. He could die. Well, I'm not really sure where you get off telling me what my son can and can't wear. What do you think about that? In fact, I think you can fuck off. Uh, I can just keep him home on pajama day? Matt Damon told me fortune favors the brave, and I lost all my fucking money! I'm going to rally all the parents, and I'm going to the press! If my son can't wear his pajamas to school, then no kids are going to wear their pajamas to school!  
Well, I don't have much experience but I thought I'd give real estate a try. Well, I do believe I'm good with people, and the truth is... I need to do this for my son. Our...rent is going up because of all the new people moving into town – and I don't think I can afford it anymore.  Hello, sweetie! I'm sorry, honey, mommy had some errands. Honey... Mommy has some big news.  I... got a job, Eric.  Oh, honey – It's going to be good! Mommy is just going to be working a few days a week and you can be a big boy and take care of yourself. Eric, this has to happen. We can't afford to live in this house unless I make more money, and this job pays really well. I'm a real estate agent. Okay, Liane... you've got this. You can do this!  Hello there! I believe I spoke with you on the phone? I'm Liane Cartman with South Park Realtors! Well, this is the house I was telling you about. It just came on the market.  It's a 2,300 square foot mid colonial home. Detached garage– Excuse me? Oh, you're about five minutes from the local gym.  Oh! Um, you have such a lovely family! It must have been a big drive from the city? Well, come on in, let me show you around! Eric, what are you doing? Uh, excuse me one moment.  Eric! What are you up to? You are not a real estate agent– Now just march right back home and I will see you when I am done with work!  Eric, this house is being represented by South Park Realtors. You don't get to just walk in and show it! Ooh! Okay. Hi, this is Liane with South Park Realtors. Eric, stop it. You are going to get me fired, Eric. And then we are going to lose our home! I am doing this job for us! So we can have a roof over our heads! I am not talking about this anymore! You are in so much trouble, young man!  You are in big trouble, young man! I have had it with you! Come here right now! Eric! Eric, you're only making it worse! This isn't about that, Eric, and you know it! You're upset! You're upset because you don't want your mom to have a job! It is true! You're scared and you're jealous that a job will take my attention away from you! It's ok to be scared, Eric. I know that I'm the only family you have, but you're making everything worse for us! Eric, you need to stop this right now. It doesn't work that way, Eric! You aren't going to make any money—you're just driving up the market and none of your deals will make it through escrow! Fine, Eric! Will you stop all this if I quit my job?! No! Yes, Eric!..Yes...  Don't shoot! I am not a real estate agent! I am quitting as of right now. And South Park Realty Group is no more.
