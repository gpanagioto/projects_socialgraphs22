Yeah! You're dead! Dude! Every time we play Americans vs. Bosnians, you cheat! Well? Now what are we going to do? I dunno. Okay. We do? Whoa, dude. Your dad is watching ''Terrance and Phillip''. Whoa, dude! Wow, cartoons are getting really dirty! Yeah. Hey Stan, what did your dad mean when he said we're gonna play Truth or Dare? Dude, what kind of sick joke is that? Girls suck ass. What? Why? Hey yeah! That'd be sweet! We could totally ruin their lives! It's not lame, it's sweet! After we build this clubhouse, we're gonna get girls to play Truth or Dare! Because, dumbass, we can dare them to do gross stuff and make them cry! What? Were you born yesterday? Fine! Fine! Fine! When is Mr. Hat coming back? When is Mr. Hat coming back? Good guess, dude! Dude! Where have you been? I've been waiting all afternoon. To me?? We should use nails, dude. Hey, Stan. Do you know how to play Truth or Dare? Well dude, how the hell are we supposed to play it, then?  Dude, I don't think this is very sturdy. Okay. Stan, if I didn't know you better, I would almost think you're doing this because you wanna play with girls. Right. Why? Too eager to what? Okay. Yeah? Umm. Dare? What? What?!! Sick, dude, I'm not kissing a girl! It's just wrong, that's all. What the hell have you gotten me into?! Hoh boy. Sick! Aggghhh! Fucking sickening! Okay. Huh? Okay, that's fine.  But I don't care. You bastard!
