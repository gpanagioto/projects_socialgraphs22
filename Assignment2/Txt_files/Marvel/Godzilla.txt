'''''Godzilla, King of the Monsters''''' is a comic book title that was published by [[Marvel Comics]], based on the character [[Godzilla]] from [[Toho]] films.

==Publication history==
From 1977 to 1979, Godzilla starred in a 24-issue run of comics<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/series/2392/covers |title=GCD :: covers :: Godzilla |publisher=Comics.org |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}</ref> written by [[Doug Moench]], drawn by [[Herb Trimpe]] and published by [[Marvel Comics]] entitled ''Godzilla, King of the Monsters''.<ref>{{cite book|last = Sanderson|first = Peter|authorlink = Peter Sanderson|editor-last = Gilbert|editor-first = Laura|chapter= 1970s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2008|page = 180|isbn =978-0756641238|quote= In August 1977, Marvel produced comics featuring the most famous monster in Japanese cinema, Godzilla, in a series by writer Doug Moench and penciller Herb Trimpe.}}</ref> The series thrusts Godzilla completely into the [[Marvel Universe]]. Godzilla first appears by bursting out of an iceberg near Alaska.<ref>''Godzilla, King of the Monsters'' #1</ref> Over the course of the series, he crosses the continental United States and eventually ends up in [[New York City]].<ref>''Godzilla, King of the Monsters'' #17–24</ref>

Godzilla's appearances in the first 15 [[Toho]] films are briefly alluded to, but never specifically mentioned due to copyright restrictions,<ref>Marvel's contract with Toho permitted them the comics rights to Godzilla, but did not permit them to use the other Toho monsters such as Minilla, Rodan, Mothra, Anguirus, King Ghidorah, Mechagodzilla, etc.</ref> once in each of the first two issues.<ref>''Godzilla, King of the Monsters'' #1–2</ref> In at least one of the issues, Godzilla is seen as "the lesser of two evils". He has clashed with other monsters in the past and generally acts more like an actual animal, albeit one with unusual levels of intelligence.<ref>''Godzilla, King of the Monsters'' #2</ref> Despite such allusions to the films, Godzilla is depicted as more animal-like than as the highly intelligent, perhaps sapient, creature depicted in the majority of the films by the time of the series' printing (1977–79), in what is considered the [[Godzilla#Showa series|Showa]] period of ''Godzilla'' films (1954–75). This version of Godzilla, while intelligent, is not the protector of mankind; however, he does, at times, exhibit compassion for human characters, such as [[Dum Dum Dugan]], the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent who is tasked with his capture, destruction, or repulsion from America, and Robert "Little Rob" Takiguchi, the grandson of Japanese scientific expert Dr. Yuriko Takiguchi, who regards Godzilla as a hero and who is depicted as being Godzilla's only human friend. Unlike other characters whose actions, thoughts and feelings are told through thought balloons, Godzilla's are narrated externally via captions.

Godzilla encounters not only the agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. during the course of the series, but many other superheroes in the Marvel Comics universe. Among them are the now-defunct group the [[Champions (1975 team)|Champions]]<ref>''Godzilla, King of the Monsters'' #3</ref> (minus the [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Ghost Rider]] and [[Darkstar (Marvel Comics)|Darkstar]], although both of them were members at the time), the [[Fantastic Four]],<ref>''Godzilla, King of the Monsters'' #20–24</ref> [[Devil Dinosaur]] and [[Moon-Boy]]<ref>''Godzilla, King of the Monsters'' #21–22</ref> and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]],<ref>''Godzilla, King of the Monsters'' #23–24</ref> along with a brief cameo by [[Spider-Man]] in the last issue of the series.<ref>''Godzilla, King of the Monsters'' #24</ref>

Godzilla also fights other gigantic monsters, including Batragon, Ghilaron, Lepirax and Centipor, monsters created by the insane geneticist [[Doctor Demonicus]],<ref>''Godzilla, King of the Monsters'' #4–5</ref> Yetrigar, a giant [[Bigfoot]],<ref>''Godzilla, King of the Monsters'' #10–11</ref> and the alien monsters the Beta-Beast and the Mega-Monsters-Triax, Rhiahn and Krollar (which are controlled by two warring alien races called the Betans and the Megans, respectively).<ref>''Godzilla, King of the Monsters'' #12–14</ref> [[Red Ronin]], a giant [[samurai]] robot created specifically for the series,<ref>''Godzilla, King of the Monsters'' #6–8</ref> reappears in ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|Avengers]]'', ''[[Solo Avengers]]'' and an issue of ''[[Wolverine (comic book)|Wolverine]]'', in which Godzilla is given an oblique nod, being referred to as a "time-lost dinosaur" (presumably to avoid legal action by Toho, as Marvel had, by then, lost the rights to depict Godzilla). Red Ronin also appears in the series ''[[Earth X]]''.

Between February 1979 and July 1979, Marvel had the comic book rights to both Godzilla and the [[Shogun Warriors (toys)|Shogun Warriors]]. While the characters never crossed paths in their respective series, artist [[Herb Trimpe]] (who did the artwork for both of the series) drew a variation of Godzilla and [[Rodan]] alongside [[Tōshō Daimos|Daimos]], [[Great Mazinger]], [[Brave Raideen|Raydeen]] and [[Gaiking]] on the top page of a comic book ad soliciting the Shogun Warrior toys.<ref name="tinypic">{{cite web|url=http://i54.tinypic.com/303cjr9.jpg|title=Image: 303cjr9.jpg, (768 × 1200 px)|publisher=i54.tinypic.com|accessdate=October 9, 2015}}</ref> [[Mattel]] Toys (who had the license to the Shogun Warriors at the time) also had the license to produce toys based on Godzilla and Rodan at this time as well.<ref>{{cite web|author=John Eaton |url=http://www.wildtoys.com/shogun/ShogJumbo/godzilla.asp |title=Wildtoy's Shogun Warrior's Page |publisher=Wildtoys.com |accessdate=October 18, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322143659/http://www.wildtoys.com/shogun/ShogJumbo/godzilla.asp |archivedate=March 22, 2012  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=John Eaton |url=http://www.wildtoys.com/shogun/ShogJumbo/rodan.asp |title=Wildtoy's Shogun Warrior's Page |publisher=Wildtoys.com |accessdate=October 18, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322143712/http://www.wildtoys.com/shogun/ShogJumbo/rodan.asp |archivedate=March 22, 2012  }}</ref> Also around this time, Marvel had prepared another story featuring Godzilla, where he would have battled the [[Dragon Lord (comics)#Tako Shamara|Dragon Lord]]. But since the copyright had expired, they modified Godzilla into a dragon-like creature named the Wani for a story that was published in ''Marvel Spotlight'' (vol. 2) #5 (March 1980).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2009/12/24/comic-book-legends-revealed-239/ |title=Comic Book Legends Revealed #239 |first=Brian |last=Cronin |date=December 24, 2009 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130731190736/http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2009/12/24/comic-book-legends-revealed-239/ |archivedate=July 31, 2013 |url-status=live |accessdate=January 13, 2013 |quote=The Godzilla fill-in by Marv Wolfman and Steve Ditko, ended up appearing in the pages of the re-launched ''Marvel Spotlight'' in 1980 as Dragon Lord, about a fellow who can control dragons.  }}</ref><ref>[[Tom DeFalco|DeFalco, Tom]] "1980s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 197: "Tako Shamara became the Dragon Lord in ''Marvel Spotlight'' #5 by writer/editor Marv Wolfman and artist Steve Ditko."</ref>

Despite the loss of copyright, Marvel would continue to use Godzilla for several years afterward. In ''[[Iron Man (comic book)|Iron Man]]'' #193, one of Godzilla's primary antagonists from the original series, Doctor Demonicus, captures, mentally controls and mutates Godzilla further so that he no longer resembles his Toho namesake. This altered version of the monster first appeared in ''Iron Man'' #193<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/issue/39905/ |title=GCD :: issue :: Iron Man #193 |publisher=Comics.org |date=August 1, 2004 |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}</ref> and would return in #194 and 196. His last appearance to date was in ''[[Thing (comics)|The Thing]]'' #31, where he is actually referred to as Godzilla (although it is not known if the person saying this actually knows that he ''is'' Godzilla, or if this is just an example of the name possibly being used to refer to any big, green dinosaur that resembles a ''[[Tyrannosaurus]] rex'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/issue/41011/ |title=GCD :: issue :: The Thing No.&nbsp;31 |publisher=Comics.org |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}</ref> Godzilla also appeared in a shaded silhouette in a monster handbook viewed by Japanese children in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #181 (May 1981). Here the children refer to him as ''Gojira'', his Japanese name.

Apart from this, Godzilla has been referenced or parodied in other Marvel comics. In ''Web of Spider-Man Annual'' #2 (1986), the character [[Warlock (New Mutants)|Warlock]] from [[The New Mutants]] turned into Godzilla and then into [[King Kong]] during a rampage through New York City.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/issue/97709/ |title=GCD :: issue :: Web of Spider-Man Annual No.&nbsp;2 |publisher=Comics.org |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}</ref> In ''The New Mutants Annual'' #3 (1987), the [[Impossible Man]] turns into Godzilla during a battle with Warlock, who turns into [[Red Ronin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/issue/42269/ |title=GCD :: issue :: The New Mutants Annual No.&nbsp;3 |publisher=Comics.org |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}</ref> In ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #413 (July 1996), Spider-Man battles a giant robot toy Godzilla (among other giant robot toys) created by the villain [[Mysterio]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/issue/83384/ |title=GCD :: issue :: The Amazing Spider-Man No.&nbsp;413 |publisher=Comics.org |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}</ref> In ''[[The Mighty Avengers]]'' #1 (May 2007), a creature bearing a resemblance to the Heisei (1980s and 1990s) Godzilla appears, alongside other giant monsters sent to attack the surface world by the [[Mole Man]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/issue/345026/ |title=GCD :: issue :: The Mighty Avengers No.&nbsp;1 |publisher=Comics.org |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}</ref> When this issue was solicited in ''Marvel Previews'' via a sneak peek page, the creature had Godzilla's distinctive dorsal spines,<ref name="imageshack">{{cite web|url=http://img577.imageshack.us/img577/8928/zillaspines.jpg |title=Image: zillaspines.jpg, (288 × 384 px) |publisher=img577.imageshack.us |accessdate=October 9, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308191456/http://img577.imageshack.us/img577/8928/zillaspines.jpg |archivedate=March 8, 2012  }}</ref> but when the actual comic was published, the dorsal spines had been removed.<ref name="imageshack2">{{cite web|url=http://img232.imageshack.us/img232/8190/zillanospines.jpg |date=March 26, 2007 |title=Image: zillanospines.jpg, (232 × 296 px) |publisher=img232.imageshack.us |accessdate=October 9, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120612124551/http://img232.imageshack.us/img232/8190/zillanospines.jpg |archivedate=June 12, 2012  }}</ref> Godzilla is also mentioned in the 2005 one-shot comic ''Marvel Monsters: From the Files of Ulysses Bloodstone and the Monster Hunters''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/series/19335/ |title=GCD :: series :: Marvel Monsters: From the Files of Ulysses Bloodstone and the Monster Hunters |publisher=Comics.org |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}</ref> In ''[[Astonishing X-Men]]'' (vol. 3) #36 (April 2011), the monster [[Fin Fang Foom]] is rampaging through downtown Tokyo. In one panel, he passes by a building that has a Godzilla billboard on its roof.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/issue/808151/cover/4/ |title=GCD :: cover :: Astonishing X-Men No.&nbsp;36 |publisher=Comics.org |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}</ref>

The ''Marvel Comics Atlas'' (in the article on Japan) states that the Age of Monsters began in 1954, which is evidently a reference to [[Godzilla (1954 film)|the original film ''Godzilla'']]. Additionally, the entry mentions that Godzilla returns years later in North America and is the reason for the construction of Red Ronin and the formation of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Godzilla Squad. S.H.I.E.L.D.'s anti-Godzilla [[helicarrier]], the ''Behemoth'', has recently resurfaced under the command of [[Amadeus Cho]] in ''[[The Incredible Hercules]]'' #115 (April 2008). Dr. Yuriko Takiguchi, too, has reappeared in recent years, having been recruited by the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] to join his X-Club in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #506 (April 2009). Another monster resembling Godzilla served as the "self-destruct event" for Takiguchi's lab on Kunashir Island in ''[[X-Men: First Class (comics)|X-Men: First Class]]'' (vol. 2) #3 (October 2007).

In 2006, Marvel reprinted the entire 24-issue run of ''Godzilla, King of the Monsters'' as a [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] called ''Essential Godzilla, King of the Monsters''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/series/17007/ |title=GCD :: series :: Essential Godzilla |publisher=Comics.org |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}</ref> Like all of Marvel's [[Essential Marvel|''Essential'' line]], the series was published in black and white rather than color, as in its original printing.

==Reception==
In July 1977, Marvel revealed that the first issue had already sold 200,000 copies in its first press run. They announced that they would increase the amount of copies printed in future press runs to meet demand.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kwitny |first1=Jonathan |date=26 July 1977 |title=Godzilla's fights were carefully choreographed |page=5 |work=[[Des Moines Register]] |url=https://newspaperarchive.com/des-moines-register-jul-26-1977-p-5/ |url-access=subscription |access-date=7 April 2022 |quote=Toho's American agent, Henry Saperstein (...) The films cost about {{US$|1.2 million|long=no}} each to make, and gross about {{US$|20 million|long=no}} worldwide, he says; about $5 million of that gets back to Toho, which has been releasing two films a year recently. (...) Marvel says its first Godzilla comic book sold 200,000 copies, and that future monthly press runs are being increased. Mattell says it will show its Godzilla toys next February, buoyed by a recent survey showing that 80 per cent of the male population of Los Angeles between the ages of four and nine are Godzilla fans. |via=[[NewspaperArchive]]}}</ref>
