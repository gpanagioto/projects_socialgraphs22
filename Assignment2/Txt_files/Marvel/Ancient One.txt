==Fictional character biography==
The character who would eventually become the Ancient One was born in [[Kamar-Taj]], "a hidden land high in the [[Himalayan Mountains|Himalayas]]",<ref name=ST148p2 /> more than 500 years ago.<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=18}}</ref> He spent his youth as a peaceful farmer, until his friend [[Kaluu]] discovered the power of magic.<ref>"The Origin of the Ancient One!" p. 3</ref> When Kaluu shared this knowledge of the mystic arts with the Ancient One, the two disagreed on how they would use the powers. The Ancient One wished to turn their village into a utopia, while Kaluu desired power and conquest over nearby villages.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://comicvine.gamespot.com/ancient-one/4005-2212/ | website=ComicVine | title=Ancient One| access-date=May 21, 2022}}</ref>

The Ancient One and Kaluu agreed to cast a spell, eliminating sickness, disease, and age from Kamar-Taj. Subsequently, the villagers, under Kaluu's mind-control spell, crown him king of the village.<ref name=ST148p2>{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Stan|last2=O'Neil|first2=Denny|chapter=The Origin of the Ancient One!|date=September 1966|title=[[Strange Tales]]|publisher=Marvel Comics Group|page=2|edition=148}}</ref> The Ancient One attempts to stop Kaluu, but the village of Kamar-Taj is wiped out as a result of their conflict.<ref>"The Origin of the Ancient One!" p. 10</ref> As a result, Kaluu is banished to an alternate dimension and the Ancient One is stripped of his immortality. Nonetheless, the Ancient One ages far more slowly than any regular human.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #111</ref>

===Acquiring knowledge===
[[File:Kamar-Taj - Strange Tales 148 - Dr Strange story p2.png|thumb|left|300px|Introduction of the Ancient One's native home, the "hidden land" of Kamar-Taj, identified only as in the [[Himalaya]] mountains. ''Strange Tales'' #148 (September 1966). Script by [[Denny O'Neil]], art by [[Bill Everett]].]]

The Ancient One settles in the [[Himalaya]] Mountains and builds a palace as his home, together with an order of monks that he forms for his own protection and support. In a tournament organized by the sorcerer Aged Genghis, the Ancient One wins the title of Earth's Sorcerer Supreme and subsequently takes on responsibility for a student, who later becomes [[Mister Jip]]. The student is then banished from the Ancient One's home when the student is discovered by his master to have been studying forbidden books of black magic to increase his own power.<ref>''Strange Tales'' vol. 3 #11</ref>

===Taking an apprentice===
As he ages and weakens, the Ancient One seeks out another student and eventually approaches Anthony Ludgate Druid, a psychiatrist with mystical talents. Posing as the High Lama, the Ancient One trains Druid to become [[Doctor Druid]].<ref>''Avengers Spotlight'' #37</ref>

After a car crash, surgeon [[Doctor Strange|Stephen Strange]] seeks assistance from the Ancient One to cure the nerve damage in his hands, only to angrily refuse when offered to be the Ancient One's apprentice instead. The Ancient One then accepts Strange as a student when Strange discovers Mordo and Dormammu had become collaborators and that Mordo had perpetrated an attack against the Ancient One. Unaware of the Ancient One's awareness of the threat against him, Strange confronts Mordo about his treachery only to be bound by restraining spells to prevent him from warning the Ancient One or physically attacking Mordo. Alarmed at these developments and concerned for the old man's safety, Strange concludes that the only way to help him would be to learn magic himself to gain a hope of stopping Mordo. When Strange is driven by this selfless purpose, he approaches the Ancient One to accept his offer. The pleased mentor promptly frees Strange from his restraints and explains the whole situation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Stan|last2=Ditko|first2=Steve|title=The Origin of Doctor Strange|journal=Strange Tales|date=1963-09-10|volume=|issue= #115}}</ref>

Mordo leaves the palace shortly afterwards and Stephen becomes the Ancient One's successor under the name [[Doctor Strange]].<ref>''Strange Tales'' #115</ref> The Ancient One often assists Strange. But when the extra-dimensional monster [[Shuma-Gorath]] tries to invade Earth through the Ancient One's mind while the latter is in the Crypts of Kaa-U, the Ancient One prompts Strange to destroy the portion of the Ancient One's mind in which the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]], or sense of self, exists. While such action blocks the way for Shuma-Gorath, trapping him within the Ancient One's mind, the Ancient One's physical body is also destroyed. The Ancient One's corporeal existence is over, but his soul subsequently achieves [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]], becoming one with the universe and [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]]. Strange then inherits the Ancient One's title as Sorcerer Supreme.<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #8-10</ref>

The Ancient One demonstrates his existence following the death of his physical body by manifesting himself as an avatar of Eternity, intervening in a struggle between Doctor Strange and Eternity.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' vol. 2 #12-13</ref> He also briefly regains his corporeal form, during which time he lives as an [[alcoholism|alcohol-dependent]] derelict in the [[Bowery]] section of [[Manhattan]], New York, United States.<ref name="mnyc">{{cite book  | last = Sanderson  | first = Peter  | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City  | publisher = [[Pocket Books]]  | year = 2007  | location = New York City  | isbn = 978-1-4165-3141-8  | page = 18}}</ref> He resumed his oneness with the universe upon Doctor Strange's defeat of the Creators.<ref>''Strange Tales'' vol. 2 #26-28</ref>

===The next life===
During Hercules' journey to the underworld in the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'' storyline, the Ancient One was seen in Erebus gambling for his resurrection. As explained to Hercules, the afterlife has become a shambles, due to various entities not paying attention.<ref>''The Incredible Hercules'' #129</ref>

During a demonic invasion of New York via the [[Eye of Agamotto]], [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] finds himself transferred into a white void when he comes in contact with the Eye, resulting in a face-to-face confrontation with a form that appears to be the Ancient One; the form claims that both he and a currently-unidentified associate are responsible for the demonic invasion due to his anger at Strange's recent "failures".<ref name="New Avengers vol. 2 #3">''The New Avengers'' vol. 2 #3</ref> However, a casual comment by [[Spider-Man]] prompts Strange, [[Doctor Voodoo]], and [[Daimon Hellstrom]] to realize that they are actually dealing with Agamotto himself, as the Ancient One's demands for the Eye defy everything that was previously told to Strange about how the Eye is passed from one sorcerer to another.<ref name="New Avengers vol. 2 #3"/>

After Doctor Strange defeats [[Daniel Drumm]], using dark magic that does not control him, the Ancient One's spirit appears and speaks to Doctor Strange:

{{quote|You taught yourself to vanquish a foe who used your friends as weapons against. And you did it without hurting any of them. You protected this realm even though it is no longer your duty. I know that you relinquished your role as Sorcerer Supreme because you thought you did not deserve it anymore. Yet you continued to act as hero to anyone and everyone. And you asked for nothing in return. And because of this, I bequeath you once again the all-seeing Eye of Agamotto. For you are the Sorcerer Supreme once more."<ref>''The New Avengers'' vol. 2 #34 (Jan. 2013)</ref>}}

The Ancient One appears as a teacher to multiple magical students in school started by Stephen Strange.<ref>''Strange Academy'' #2-3 (2020)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==

The Ancient One possessed the ability to manipulate the forces of magic for a vast number of effects and was able to tap into extra-dimensional energy by invoking entities or objects of power, existing in dimensions tangential to those of the Earth, through the recitation of spells. The Ancient One was capable of [[astral projection]], [[levitation]], interdimensional teleportation, and a large number of other effects. However, in his extreme old age, the Ancient One was unable to perform any major feats of sorcery without placing great physical strain upon himself.

The Ancient One also possessed a variety of mystical objects, such as the Book of the Vishanti, the [[Orb of Agamotto|Orb]], Amulet, and [[Eye of Agamotto]], and devices gathered throughout his lifetime. After he unified with Eternity, the extent of the Ancient One's powers ceased to be known.
