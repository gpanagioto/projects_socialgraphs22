Skank Skankhunt, can you hear me? The troll locked us in the control room with his Danish workers. Skankhunt! The TrollTrace servers monitor and catalog outrage and hate on the internet, there's a troll out there trying to overload them by generating tons of hate. Skank, whoever's doing it is doing it from ''your'' account. Yeah, he's pissing off a lot of people. Hello? Can you hear me? This is Dildo Shwaggins. I'm a colleague of your fathers. We see what you're trying to do, and we're gonna help, we trolled with your father, now we will troll with you. Son, you need to know that your father is very proud of you. He was the best at Trevor's Axiom, he believes you can be too. Skank! You still there? The servers are starting to heat up, but the Danish say there are breakers that will never let them overload. You got to climb up the building and shut off the breakers.  Skank. Skankhunt, are you there yet?  Skank, do you see a large red lever?  Flip it off  That's good. Keep going Skankhunt.  Skank, there's no more time! Have you found the last breaker? That's it. Your dad's got it. Give it everything you got!
