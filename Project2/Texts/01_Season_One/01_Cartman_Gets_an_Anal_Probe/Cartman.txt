I know what it means! I'm not telling you. He-yeah, that's what Kyle's little brother is all right!  That's 'cause I was having these bogus nightmares. Well, I dreamt that I was lying in my bed... ...in the dark, when all of a sudden this bright blue light filled the room. Then slowly my bedroom door began to open...  ...and then the next thing I remember, I was being drug through a hallway. Weeaak! Then I was lying on a table... ...and these scary aliens wanted to operate on me. And they had big heads and big black eyes. What? No, it was just a dream, my mom said so. Oh, shut up, guys! You're just trying to make me scared. And it's not working. Kick ass.  Huh? Eh, no, that, that was just a dream. And I'm not fat, I'm big boned! Oh! Oh! No! Uh-I mean, eh, why would they do that? No! Shut up, dildo! Oh! God damn it, they didn't do anything to my ass! It was just a dream! Shut up! Shut up you guys, it's not working. Heh, somebody's baking brownies.  Heh, heh, that's a, that's, that's a little joke. Heh, heh. Hah, hah. Mr. Hat yelled at you. Ow! My ass!  Uh... Ow! My ass! No, that was just a dream. No, Mr. Garrison, I'm fine.  Oh!! Whoa, I sure am hungry. Shut up, dude, you're being totally immature.  Stan wants to ki-iss Wendy Testabur-ger. I'm not fat. And you obviously like her because you throw up every time she talks to you. Or slip her the tongue. You are making it up. What?  Oh, I see. Now you're going to join in on the little joke huh? Oh, you guys sure are going a long ways to try and scare me. I want my Salisbury steak! Oh!! You guys, my ass, seriously..! I would if I could, you son of a bitch! Uhâ€”Would you stop going on about your little brother? I know it was just a dream, I know I didn't have an anal probe, and I know that I'm not under alien control! Ah, son of a bitch! You guys, shut up. I'm not under alien control. Uh... Hey... Ow!  That hurts, you buttlicker! No! He's not dead. Shut up, you guys. God damn it, I didn't have an anal probe!

No, leave me alone mom!   What? Well, that does sound pretty good. Uh, Mom? If anybody calls or comes over, I'm not here, okay? Yeah, I want Cheesy Poofs. Hey, that kind of looks like... Tom Selleck. No, Kitty, this is mah pot pie. No, Kitty, you bad kitt--! No, Kitty, it's mah pot pie! Mom! Kitty's being a dildo!  What? No, Kitty, you can't have any! No, Kitty, this is mah pot pie! Bad Kitty--!

Sure, you guys, what-ever. You guys, I am seriously getting pissed off right now! I know there is no such things as aliens! Oh, God damn it! What the hell are they talking about? You guys, get me down from here! Ow! Help! Sons o' bitches! Dildos! Puh! Ah, man, I had this crazy nightmare last night. Well, I was standing out in a field, and I had this huge satellite dish sticking out of my butt. And then there was... hundreds of cows and aliens, and then I went up on the ship and Scott Baio gave me pinkeye.  why don't I have pinkeye then? Ahh, son of a bitch!
