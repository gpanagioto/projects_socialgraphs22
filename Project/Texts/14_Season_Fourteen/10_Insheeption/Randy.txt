Oh yeah. Like that weird guy over on on Burgess Road. That guy, Mr. Yelman. He's been hoarding animals for years now. What does that mean? What?! Aw come on, that's stupid. How's that, how's that even possible? What kind of hoarding specialist are you?! You trapped our son in his counselor's subconscious, and now you're saying he could die in there?! That does it!  I'm goin' in!  If they're locked into his regression, then maybe I can be too! Damn your incongruities!  I'm goin' in after my son! I said get me in there! Ahhh. Stan?  Stan! Yes, it's me, Stan. It's me! Up here!  I'm a butterfly! I'm flying free with my beautiful butterfly wings! I was gonna, but ooh! This is fun! Butterflies have no concern for such things, Stan. I'm gonna go find me some butterly poon.  Aah ahhh aha ahhh. Aw, dammit.
