Sgt. Stanley Marsh is trapped behind enemy lines. His only chance of survival is to sneak past the Bosnian guard who stands watch. Sgt. Marsh knows it's now or never. He must make a run for it. American base is only a few feet away. Cartman, we shot your Bosnian fat ass! No, you don't! Yeah, Cartman, you suck! If you want to play Americans vs. Bosnians any more, you can just play with yourself! Huh-I dunno. Hi, Wendy. No. We could? But dude, I don't have a clubhouse. Just how many guys' clubhouses have you been in?  Truth or Dare? Wow. Come on, Kyle. We've got work to do. We're gonna build a clubhouse. I have to ask my dad for help. Hey, Dad, we need to build a clubhouse. How do we do it? Yeah, dude! How'd you know? Dude! Sweet! This is a sweet spot for a clubhouse. Oh uh, just that, mmmaybe when we're finished, Wendy and- uh... Bebe can come over and play. Well-uhuh, of course they do, but uh, wouldn't it be sweet to- to play Truth or Dare with them? Because, dude. We could make them do really gross stuff, like eat bugs. We're building a clubhouse. Yeah, now beat it you guys. This clubhouse is private! Fine! Fine! Getting a cookie. We're building a clubhouse and then we're-- 'Kay. But Mr. Twig sucks. Better than yours, fat boy. Almost. Yes, Mr. Garrison.  Um. You said that even though- Charo appeared twelve times on the ''Love Boat'', the episode with Captain and Tennille got higher ratings. Phew. No, I just-- I'm not lying. Someone just handed me the-- But I didn't write the note! Shut up, Cartman! Oh, man. Whoa, dude! What's 'skylarkings'? Who? Oh, no. It wasn't my note, dude. It was some girl's. Excuse me. Hello? I got in trouble for that note Bebe was trying to pass to you.  I mean, no. Not to you. Forget it. Come on, dude. We have to finish our clubhouse quick. The girls wanna play Truth or Dare tomorrow! My mom won't let us. Pretty good. We're almost done. We're going as fast as we can! Come on, dude, we have to hammer faster. No. I didn't even think about that. And I say, "Dare!" "Truth?" But that's boring! I want to get "Dare" to kiss her. Oooh. Yeah. "Dare!" Oooh. You really think so? Wow! Hello? We're working on it. No, you don't! Dude! Aw, that hunk of fat--  Mom, will you please ask Dad to come help me build my clubhouse? What?! Why? Divorced? On no. Does that mean you and Dad don't love me anymore? This is all my fault, isn't it? ...Dude, you're not supposed to say that! What?! This is happening way too fast. Okay. We're done. It doesn't matter, dude. It only has to last long enough to play Truth or Dare. I'm gonna go get the girls. G'oh? Go where? But no! I have to get the girls to come- Weak! Dad? But I don't understand why we have to-- Well, I don't like being around my sister anymore; does that mean I can leave her, too? But you and Mom are family; how come you can just split up? You know what I think? I think that when you and Mom got married, you became family. And now that you are, you shouldn't be able to leave her anymore than I can leave my sister. What? That's it? I guess, but-- Okay, dude, the girls are gonna be here to play Truth or Dare any minute. No way, dude! Don't be silly. We have to say "Truth" a couple of times before we say "Dare," right? Because if we don't, we'll seem too eager. To say "Dare," dumbass! Jeez. Oh, hi Wendy. What's up? Yeah! I mean, sure, whatever.  Remember, "Truth" the first couple of times. Dude! Don't be a chicken, dude. Just close your eyes. Dude, Cartman is in his clubhouse playing Truth or Dare with girls right now. You really want him to beat us?  Dare. ...Dude, we cut firewood all day yesterday! We have enough to last twelve years! Crap! Do you mind if I watch cartoons? I've had a rough day. What? My dad lets me watch cartoons. Roy's a dick! He ruined my chances with Wendy in the clubhouse! If that's true, then get back together with Dad for me! Oh. Divorce is stupid. Yeah. Yeah, I think I'll write a little note for Roy. Wow. Clubhouses are magical. Dare. ...What?!
