 but you can't leave us hanging. You've got the purest shit out there; it's worth a lot to us. How many times have you said "I think I've lost it" and everything turned out to be okay? Every time.

He writes the songs, sends us the demos, we fudge them, sell them as a brooding 17-year-old girl way ahead of her time, and nobody knows the difference. He makes good stuff. Stuff that sells. But he's getting edgy feet. I want you to keep an eye on him. And if anyone around him seems like they're close to finding out the truth, well... you know what to do.
