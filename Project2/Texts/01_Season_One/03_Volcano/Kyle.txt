Ready to go hunting, Cartman?  Don't get scared up in the mountains Cartman. I like chocolate milk. Wow, that'd be cool. What do you mean? I guess so. What?! Shoot it Stan. Hey, what's that? You were scared Cartman! you almost peed your pants! No, No thanks, that stuff tastes like pee. Shut up, Cartman! You can't scare anybody! Deformed how? A knife. Patrick Duffy? Damn it Cartman, that's not scary! Yeah, give me that flashlight. What is that? Gosh, I hope he doesn't cut me with his celery hand. Stan, Stan, wake up! I don't know where Cartman is. I think something took him away. They're out fishing with Kenny. Well Stan, you want to know what I think? Look! Dude, it's Scuzzlebutt! Cartman wasn't lying.  Look, up there.  Come on Stan, kill it. Whoa! Oh my God, they killed Kenny! Oh my God! Look at his leg! Aaaaah! Hey look, Kenny's okay. Yeah, make up your mind, dude! Dude, I don't understand hunting at all.
