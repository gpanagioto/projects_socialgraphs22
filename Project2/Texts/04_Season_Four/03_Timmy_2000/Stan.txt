Dude, did you do all your homework last night? I know! Uh, Mr. Garrison, haven't you figured it out? Timmys' retarded. But he ''is''- He doesn't have to do homework? I've got ADD. Dude, it's Timmy. Yeah, Timmy ruhules! But he's funny. Yeah, what a dick. Timmy's five times more talented than he is. Huh? No, we're not actually gonna take that stuff. Because we're on Ritalin. Oh boy oh boy. But there are no side effects, Chef. See what? Let's watch something else. Oh dear. Timmy's band broke up? Yeah. Phil Collins was right. People laughed at Timmy, and Timmy should be at home, where he's protected from laughter. Sounds good. Oh my goodness, you killed Kenny. Chef, are you going to the Phil Collins concert tomorrow? Sure was, Dad. Oh, thank you, Chef. How nice.  I feel... different. Wait a minute! Phil Collins sucks ass! Get off the stage, Phil Collins! We want Timmy! No!  You see, we learned something today. Yeah, sure, we laughed at Timmy, but what's wrong with laughter? Just because we laugh at something doesn't mean we don't care about it. Timmy made us smile, and playing made Timmy smile, so where was the harm in that? The people that are wrong are the ones that think people like Timmy should be "protected" and kept out of the public's eye. The cool thing about Timmy being in a band was that he was in your face, and you ''had'' to deal with him, whether you laughed or cried, or felt nothing. That's why Timmy rules!
