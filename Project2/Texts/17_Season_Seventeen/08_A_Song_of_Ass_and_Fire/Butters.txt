 Yeah! You mean Princess Kenny, m'lord? They don't! Yeah, I finished it! Nothing! The dragons are just still on their way! They keep promising dragons, but all I get are more floppy wieners in my face! Wha-what do you want ''me'' to do? Who's George R. R. Martin? Well come on, Scott. You're lagging. Let's just talk to this guy, and then we can hit a McDonald's. Oh here we go. 2217.  Hello? Is this George R. R. Martin's house? Uhhhh, it's two kids who want to know what happens when the dragons show up?  Hello? We're not fans! We don't like it! And I'm pretty pissed off, if you wanna know the truth! Let me talk to George R. R. Martin, and I'll tell him about what!  Uh no sir, we just really need to know about the dragons, but they never seem to show up. When?  Please. It's urgent. No, uhno, can we skip the wiener stuff and just get to the dragons? Uh what's the matter, Scott? He's diabetic. Oh. Okay, thanks. OOAH! Uh, sir, you said pizzas were coming! But you said they were on their way like three hours ago!   Listen, buddy! You promised that pizzas were on the way! If they don't show up right now, you're gonna have a dead kid in your hands! Do you hear me?! What kind do we want?! Come on, Scott! We're leaving!  NO! Black Friday is about to happen, and my friends and I have to be the first ones inside the mall to get XBoxes! Whatoyou mean?
