South Park Elementary, day. Kids are filing into school. Inside, they go to their lockers and switch out books.

PC Principal

[off-screen, but you can hear him slamming lockers shut] Who was it?! Somebody's about to get their asses kicked! [a bunch of kids run screen right.] When I find out who did this!

Butters

[runs into view towards the other fourth graders] PC Principal is on the warpath! Run for your lives! [turns right and runs down another hallway]

Stan

[to Kyle] Again?

Kyle

Oh Jesus, now what?

PC Principal

[appears at screen left and walks towards the fourth graders.] Who was it?! Huh?! Somebody better fess up RIGHT NOW! I'm gonna find out who did this! [Kyle closes his locker and begins to walk away. PC Principal notices] Broflovski! Was it you?

Kyle

Was what me, sir?

PC Principal

I just saw a copy of the school newspaper in which a student used the word "retarded" to refer to our cafeteria lunch policy! The word "retarded" does not belong in our school!! Who is in charge of the school paper?! 'Cause I'm about to break their fuckin' legs!

Stan

Aaah, he's in charge of the school paper. [points to his right. PC Principal turns left and faces... Jimmy. PC Principal is speechless.] You gonna break his legs, PC Principal?

-----


Principal's office, moments later. PC Principal faces Jimmy.

PC Principal

Alright, uhh, I I guess we haven't formally met before. Uhh, the reason I need to talk with you, Jason, is because of a very important-

Jimmy

It's Jimmy, actually. My name is Jimmy, PC Principal.

PC Principal

Alright, Jim. Thank you. I want to talk to you today about the use of the R word in your school paper. [holds up the paper, on which the subject on the front page is chocolate milk being removed from the school menu, "LEAVE OUR CHOCOLATE MILK ALONE"] You see, the 'R' word is very bad.

Jimmy

Says who?

PC Principal

Says me. Right? Now I know a thing or two about the rights of people with disabilities. When you use the 'R' word to describe the school's lunch policy, it can hurt people's hearts. [places his hand over his heart] Can you understand that at all?

Jimmy

That was an op-ed piece in the paper written by a first grader who found the school lunch policy to be ridiculous, and he thought "r-retarded" to be the best word to describe it. As the editor of the paper, I didn't think it was right to censor the words the student used.

PC Principal

...Okay, well, from now on I'm gonna need to approve the school paper before you hand it out, okay?

Jimmy

No.

PC Principal

What'd you say?

Jimmy

You're new here, so you don't understand how seriously I take my job as editor of the school paper. I don't allow ads, and I don't allow anything that might t-t-t-taint the truth behind what people are thinking. i don't want people to be afraid of words if it stops them from having a dialog.

PC Principal

Look, I don't wanna get angry, okay?

Jimmy

Why? Are you uncomfortable around people with disabilities? That's okay. Lot's of people are.

PC Principal

No, I'm not. I am very not uncomfortable. Alright, look, unless I can approve your paper, it is not being distributed on campus, you got that?

Jimmy

I can't hand out the school paper in school?

PC Principal

Not unless it is approved by me. Do you understand?

Jimmy

Yep, got it.

-----


Neighborhood, day. Jimmy went for distributing the school paper outside of school instead of letting PC Principal approve it for in-school distribution. He appears riding a small Thomas the Tank Engine scooter with small trailer behind him that holds all the papers and begins throwing copies of the paper to all the houses

Jimmy

Don't forget to read the school paper! Now delivered directly to your door. [Wendy is the first student to get the paper. Clyde is next] Super School News! [Jimmy smiles and rides away. His seventh delivery is to Butters' house. Stephen opens the door and the paper smacks him in the face. He manages to catch it though. Jimmy goes on to the PC Delta house and tosses a paper there too. A few PC Bros are lounging around outside]

PC bro 10

What is that, bro? [the front door opens and PC Principal walks out.]

PC Principal

[picks up the paper, takes off the rubber band, and reads it. The headline there: "PC PRINCIPAL'S 'RETARDED' POLICY, by Jimmy Valmer]

Jimmy

[holds up his right middle finger at him] S-s-s-suck my dick, PC Principal! [rides away. PC Principal's bros look at the principal.]

-----


Inside PC Delta, later. PC Principal barely contains his anger as he paces about

PC Principal

Who does this kid think he is?! Challenging me?! I said one micro-aggression to him, okay?! One little micro-aggression! But that doesn't mean I have an unconscious bias towards people with disabilities!

PC bro 4

No way, bro! That's wack!

PC Principal

But why would a person with a disability not see that what I'm trying to do is actually protect them?

PC bro 9

Sometimes victims of oppression are so marginalized that they begin to sympathize with their oppressors.

PC bro 11

Yeah bro.

PC Principal

You're right. This kid just needs to be shown he's being an Uncle Abel. I can always count on my PC frat brothers to have my back. Let's go PC!

PC bros

PC Woo!

-----


The Stotch house, night. Butters' parents are in bed. Stephen is reading the school paper, Linda is looking at her smartphone.

Stephen

Wow. [turns the page] Wow, this is so great. Have you ever read the elementary school newspaper, Linda? There's no ads, no sponsored content, no links to click on. Just news stories about what's happening. [looks at her] Did you know that the police in ShiTpaTown beat up homeless to clear them out? [returns to the paper] Do you know long it's been since I was able to just sit back and read the news? I got so used to getting news off the Internet. But I feel like I'm always trying to chase the news somehow. [sets the paper down on his laps] It's like I'm in a black void, trying to reach the news story. [he's shown doing this in a vacuum] But then the next thing I know I'm reading an ad for Geico. So I click out of that and try to read the news story but it's not a news story. It's a slide show. [for Android phones] And I'm looking at the worst celebrity plastic surgery jobs ever. So of course I want to see the next line of plastic surgery gone wrong, so I hit the arrow, but then the arrow wasn't the arrow for the next line, it was to take me to an ad for face cream. Haugh! I wanted to get a news story, but I'm reading about face cream and I try to click out of it, but the ad is following me, and it's following me all over the screen! Nooo! So I click on the close button, but it wasn't a close button, it was another slide show, and I just want to know what's happening in the Middle East, but instead, I'm looking at the top ten scariest movies of all time, and that's not the arrow for the next line, it's another ad! Aaagh! [comes back to reality] But this... this is just news. And I don't get lost in all the bullshit. Linda? [sees that she's mesmerized and shakes her] Linda!

-----


PC Principal's office, next day. Jimmy is again in there talking to PC Principal

PC Principal

Alright Jim, I know you've been trying to wrap your head around some of the social issues he discussed yesterday. I'm sure you're feeling confused and a little unsure of yourself.

Jimmy

I'm not confused at all, actually, PC Principal.

PC Principal

Okay, well, no, you are confused-

Jimmy

I'm pretty sure that you're the one, but go ahead.

PC Principal

Because you don't grasp the severity of this, and that's why I brought in another young person with disabilities to share his feelings. Thanks for comin' in to talk to us, Nathan.

Nathan

[takes a seat next to Jimmy] I like apples and bananas.

PC Principal

Me too, bro, me too. Nathan, could you tell Jimmy how you feel when people uwe the word "retarded"?

Nathan

It hurts my feelings because I feel bad.

Jimmy

Are you serious right now?

PC Principal

You feel bad, right. You feel like that's a no-no word, right?

Nathan

That word makes my heart piss its pants.

PC Principal

Okay, wow, that's pretty heavy. Pretty heavy, huh Jim?

Jimmy

Do you want to ask him what he means by that, or are you just pandering because you're uncomfortable around disabled people?

PC Principal

I am not uncomfortable! I simply care about a horrible, outdated word that is exclusive, ignores individuality, and equates intellectual disa-bility with being... [begins to stammer] And it's, and it's, s-spot, I need a spotter, spot me, somebody spot me bro!

Topher

[steps in and puts PC Principal's train of thought back on track] And it's, it's part of a derogatory hate speech which fosters isolation and loneliness and being part of a voice to stop the R word is not only right, but extremely important!

Nathan

I'm afraid of bears. [Jimmy is decidedly not convinced of PC Principal's sincerity]

-----


The hallway, later. Nathan is let go first and is walking back to class. Jimmy comes around the corner and catches up to him

Jimmy

Hey Nathan, hold up. What were you doing in there?

Nathan

What do you mean, Jimmy? Are you ma-ad?

Jimmy

Come on Nathan, you and I both know you use the word "retarded" 400 times a day.

Nathan

Oh Jimmy. So righteous, aren't you? So blind to everything that's going on.

Jimmy

What are you talking about?

Nathan

Do you really think all the changes happening to this town are just coincidence? This goes so much deeper than you can possibly imagine, Jim. Everyone's about to learn the truth. And then... There's a war coming. A war, Jim. And I'm just gonna make sure I'm on the right side of it.

Mr. Mackey

Come on, boys, let's get back to class.

Nathan

I like to smell trees! [walks off.]

Channel 4 News Break.

Anchor Tom

An elementary school newspaper is making big waves as more and more people say No to news on the Internet.

Rancher

I read super school news 'cause it don't try and fool me and it's news reports aren't paid for by ad companies.

Gerald

We just feel like this is actual news, and instead of clicking on links, we're reading stories.

Stephen

I had to get away from the ads. I felt like the ads were... evolving somehow. They started knowing what I liked. What I was afraid of. I tried ad blockers, but it seemed like every time I tried to block the ads, they just got smarter. I'm never going back from Super School News.

Anchor Tom

The young editor of the paper claims that since most people now watch news reports on the Internet, they're easily distracted or even fooled by ads, [the camera pulls back to show the news report as a video on Randy's smartphone] which are finding more and more clever ways to disguise them-

Randy

Oooo, brutal celebrity mugshots. [also on the screen, "SoDoSoPa in disrepair" Randy taps on the link, which leads to a slide show of celebrity mugshots which contains 40 images. He taps on the right arrow, and it leads to the first weight-loss ad instead of the next mugshot] O-hoh it got me. Ad got me, Sharon.

The 2015 Presidential Debate

Announcer

We now return live to the 2015 Presidential Debate.

Moderator

Our next question is for you, Mrs. Clinton. Many voters believe that Syrian refugees should not be allowed into our country for security reasons. What do you think?

Hillary

Keeping our country save has become more and more difficult, but I believe there are several things that we can-

Garrison

No! You shut the hell up! You've got a dumpy butt, and seven chins. Syrian refugees are all terrorists!

Hillary

I know that our government needs to take a harder look at all-

Garrison

Yeah well, it's pretty hard to look at you! We can all agree on that!

Caitlyn

[interrupts for a bit] She looks like a donkey took a shit in her face. [goes backstage again]

Garrison

Yeh-hah, good one Caitlyn. See, what I know is that there's only one way to deal with Syrian refugees, and that is...

Everyone

Fuck them all to death!

Garrison

Thank you!! [after the debate Garrison and Caitlyn head backstage laughing] That was hilarious when you called her a pizza face.

Caitlyn

It's like a Papa John's pimple party.

Garrison

Oh, that was classic, Caitlyn. You're the best running mate ever.

Principal Victoria

[the first thing you see is her big hair] Hello, Mr. Garrison.

Garrison

Oh My God... Principal Victoria?

Principal Victoria

[now using a came, walks forward] Congratulations on the polls. We need to talk. [Dramatic music ends Act 1.]

-----


PC Delta house, night. The place is jumping

PC bro 12

[on the sidewalk just left of the entrance] Celebrate diversity! Woooo!

PC bro 13

[on the balcony, right side] GO PC!

-----


PC Delta house, inside. More partying

PC Principal

[walks in with a mic] Alright everyone, listen up. [the music shuts off and everyone falls silent] Tonight is a very special night for the PCs. We're honored to be throwing this event for people with disabilities. [several disabled students are present, like Jimmy, Timmy, Francis, Lenora] I for one am sick of how these amazing kids are marginalized in today's society. but tonight is about learning and healing. So let's get to it! PC! [drops the mic. The other bros echo him and cheer]

PC bro 7

Hey guys, I'm Brad. I'm PC Arizona State.

Jimmy

Nice to meet you, Brad. Where do you guys-?

Brad

Excuse me a second. [walks over to a pretty brunette and her friend] Hello, ladies. Thanks for coming to our event.

Ladies

Hi.

Brad

We're just tired with the way people with disabilities get treated. Can I get you some alcohol?

PC bro 14

Yah, you know, it just bugs me when people refer to persons with disabilities as "handicapped." When I hear that word I wanna fuckin' punch them in the fuckin' face.

Blonde

That's so cool of you, wow.

PC bro 14

Yeah. [Jimmy walks into view, but no one notices him] To me marginalizing persons with disabilities by asking them what their handicap is, is a micro-aggression no better than asking a person of color if they went to college.

Blonde

Wow, you're really progressive.

PC bro 14

No other way to be. So uh, listen. I think you're really pretty and interesting, and I'd kinda like to take you upstairs and totally crush your pussy. Would that be acceptable to you?

Blonde

[looks away, giggling] Oh well, I, I guess it would.

PC bro 14

No, I'm sorry, I need affirmative consent. I'll need you to say "Yes, you may take me upstairs and crush my pussy at this time." [PC Bros and their lady guests pair up and dance, some of them making out. Brad dances with two women and makes out with the redhead. Jimmy is the only disabled person left in the room]

PC bros

PC Bros, PC. Yeah!

-----


Dawn at PC Delta. OC Principal goes knocking on every door in the house

PC Principal

McKinsey, you got consent forms?

McKinsey

Oh yeah, right here bro. [hands him the forms through the door]

PC Principal

Rise and shine guys. If you scored last night, I'll need your consent forms. [the other bros hand him their forms through their doors] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you-whoa! Barker, did you perform cunnilingus? There's a different release form, bro.

PC bro 15

Yup. Uh, so-, sorry. It's right here.

PC Principal

Nice.

PC bro 11

[voice only, behind him] Bro! Aw, dude, bro!

PC Principal

What, bro?

PC bro 11

Dude, I scored with this female and after consenting to putting her mouth on my penis, she wanted me to walk her home.

PC Principal

Yeah?

PC bro 11

And when I got to her house she had me meet her father who is Filipino, so I asked him if he could tell me about their cultural and social dynamic to being a Filipino-American.

PC Principal

Naturally.

PC bro 11

So he said some stuff, and then the newspaper landed on his doorstep, 'cause I guess her dad subscribes to the school newspaper, and he picked it up and I saw the headline said this!

-----


thrusts the paper in front of PC Principal. The headline reads "'PC' STANDSD FOR PUSSY CRUSHING"

PC Principal

[grabs the paper and reads it] What the fuck is this bro?

PC bro 11

Bro, that little kid wrote that our tolerant views and fight for social justice is just a way for us to crush puss!

PC Principal

That's not true!!

PC bro 11

I know, bro!! We're being totally victimized!

PC Principal

That little fucker, dude!

-----


Jimmy's house, day. someone knocks on his door, he opens it.

Representative

Hello. You're the boy responsible for the South Park Super School News?

Jimmy

That's right.

Representative

We would like to give you $26 million. [Jimmy seems interested, so he lets him in. They sit down at the coffee table and the rep opens his briefcase, taking out documents] Contracts, and the first check. We'd love to be in business with you.

Jimmy

What is this for?

Representative

I represent an organization called Geico. It's an insurance company. We think Super School News would be a great way for us to reach new customers.

Jimmy

Sorry Charlie, but I don't allow ads in my newspaper.

Representative

We've heard all about that, so we thought you could just do some ...news stories about car insurance. Just state the facts, because the truth is, everyone can save by switching to Geico.

Jimmy

That's called "sponsored content." I know the difference between the news and ads. Do you think I'm stupid?

Representative

Everyone's doing it, Jim. You're sort of the last holdout. $26 million just to write some news stories that get people thinking about their insurance coverage?

Jimmy

Sth-sth-sth, stick it up your ass!

Representative

Hm. [puts the documents back in the briefcase...] Well, they said you'd be tough. [...and brings out a gun and arms it] Do you really think you can stop ads?

Jimmy

Yes.

Representative

You can try to block ads, but they get smarter. The more we ty to shut them out, the more clever they get. There's a war coming, kid, and I'm gonna make sure I'm on the right side of it. [a bullet shoots through his head from behind. killing him where he stands. Blood begins oozing out his mouth. He falls to his knees and then onto the floor. Barbrady is in the doorway, his knees weak, but his gun drawn]

Jimmy

Officer Barbrady?

Barbrady

Come with me if you want to live! [he runs back to is car, but Jimmy is confused. Barbrady returns] Come on! Come with me if you want to live! I'm serious! [runs back to his car]

-----


The Marsh house, day. Randy is in the kitchen browsing on his phone when Sharon appears in the kitchen doorway with a copy of the school paper in her left hand

Sharon

Do you want to explain to me what pussy crushing is?!

Randy

What?

Sharon

Your little meetings you go to at night to discuss social justice?! [drops the paper on the table. Randy picks it up and reads the front page] It's just a way to pick up on young women?!

Randy

Sh-sharon, most of the guys in my PC club are right out of college, alright? You know how college kids are. Who wrote this?

Sharon

I don't want you going over there anymore!

Randy

[stands up] I don't cheat on you, Sharon! I'm happy. Look at what's happened to our town. We have ShiTpaTown, boutique restaurants and artisan shops. We have a fucking Whole Foods, and that was all me! Diverse people are moving here, and everyone is being aware of how they talk. This is paradise, Sharon!

Sharon

[gets in his face] Is it? [turns right and walks out towards the living room, then turns around] All I know is that you've changed. Every since you joined this PC thing you just bully people. And wait for people to say anything improper so you can jump down their throats for whatever words he or she used.

Randy

He or she is an agenderphobic microagressions, Sharon. You are a bigot. [Sharon turns around and walks away again while he resumes reading the paper.]

-----


A meeting room next to the interrogation room. The agent is there with six other agents, all looking at Jimmy. Barbrady stands off to the side against the wall.

Agent

The average human can no longer tell the difference between the news and an ad. You seem to have some mental ability that allows you to know the difference.

Jimmy

Does this have to do with me calling the school principal a pussy crusher?

Agent

The PC People are simply being manipulated, unwittingly setting the table for the new enemy of humanity.

Jimmy

You mean ISIS or ninjas?

Agent

[stands up] Something... much worse. [turns away] Have you ever felt like an ad had... intelligence? That it somehow knew what you wanted, even before you knew you wanted it? [] What if I were to tell you that ads have become smarter than us? And now they're manipulating everything we do?

Jimmy

I'd say that sounds pretty retarded.

Agent

[walks to Jimmy's end of the table, then veers away] It was our own fault. Mankind became tired of ads, so we kept inventing ways to make things ad-free. We even created ad blockers. That's when the ads had to adapt. They had to disguise themselves as news in order to survive.

Jimmy

Sponsored content?

Agent

If you really can tell the difference, then you could be the key to saving our species, Jimmy. We'd like to run a test on you.

-----


Sponsored Content, Test 17-B

Computer

Sponsored Content, Test 17-B, Ready. Begin. [a series of news articles pop up onscreen, and Jimmy has to discern whether it's news or advertisement. "Doctor Found Dead In Apartment"]

Jimmy

That's the news. ["Dental Problems on the Rise"] That's an ad. ["Missile Test Lights Up The Sky"] That's the news. ["Vermont Experiencing Heavy Snow"] That's an ad. [a different agent clicks through the articles for him] That's the news. That's an ad. That's an ad. That's the new-oh no, that's an ad for act food. My bad.

Agent

Jesus Christ, he's off the charts.

Agent 2

Increase the intensity.

Jimmy

["Man Arrested for Murder of Entire Household"] That's the news ["Price of Precious Metal Rises Due To War"] That's an ad. News. Ad. Ad. Ad. Ad. Ad. News. News. Ad. Ad. Slideshow. Ad. [The test ends and the computers wind down. Jimmy's chair is pulled away from the main computer on a track.]

Agent

That's a perfect score. You are a very special child, Jimmy.

Jimmy

I prefer "handicapped," actually.

Agent

We have another child here who's special too. [a metal security shield comes down to reveal a window, and a girl on the other side of the window.] Do you know... Leslie? [she notices him on the other side of the glass and looks at him]

-----


PC Delta house. The PC Bros are putting up yellow tape saying "SAFE SPACE - DO NOT CROSS" on it.

PC Principal

[steps outside to survey the work] Alright, that's good. Everyone get inside. Everything past here is safe space. [the bros start going inside] No reporters, no harassment. We are gonna figure this shit out. [PC Principal closes the door behind himself. Once inside, everyone is sitting around in silence. PC Principal finally speaks] All I know is that I don't speak up for minorities so that I can crush pussy.

PC bro 16

Me neither, dude. I want social justice and now I'm being made fun of.

PC bro 17

Yeah bro. They're taking our incredibly tolerant views and distorting them.

PC Principal

PC people are under attack. That's what this is.

PC bro 18

Hey yeah. Bro! We're the victims now. Like, we're being marginalized. Like... that makes us pretty cool.

Topher

Yeah, I bet now we can get a lot more puss.

PC Principal

No, Topher! It's not about puss, alright?! The fuck is wrong with you?! We're being labeled as meatheads who just wanna crush puss by an intolerant newspaper!

PC bro 16

[now standing] Yeah, fuck that dude, bro!

PC Principal

Yeah. And like, if you're gonna belittle and make fun of PC people like that, then who's to say he won't do it to other marginalized groups like us? I mean, this kid could be the next Hitler. And if you guys could stop Hitler, what would you do?

PC bro 9

I'd rip that dude apart and then go home and totally smash some puss, bro.

Other Bros

Hell yeah!

PC Principal

Nooo!

-----


The interrogation room. Jimmy now sits opposite Leslie

Leslie

You look familiar. Don't you go to my school?

Jimmy

Yes. Uh, I'm Jimmy. Editor In Chief of Super School News. [smiles]

Leslie

I'm Leslie.

Jimmy

N, nice to finally talk to you.

Leslie

Did they bring you in and give you a bunch of tests too?

Jimmy

Yes, they did. Do you know who "they" are?

Leslie

I think they're ex-newsmen. You know, the men in suits who used to be in charge of the news.

-----


the men are listening in on this conversation

Jimmy

I thought I recognized them.

Leslie

They told me I was special. Are you special too?

Jimmy

I prefer "handicapped."

Leslie

[makes a weird noise] I like that.

-----


Mr. Garrison's campaign office.

Mr. Garrison

Principal Victoria, if everything you've said is true, then, why doesn't anyone know about it?

Principal Victoria

There are people who know. But they have to stay very hidden.

Mr. Garrison

I'm just havin' a hard time swallowing all this. And between me and this one over here, we can swallow just about anything.

Caitlyn

[scoffs] Oh God, you're such an asshole.

Principal Victoria

Mr. Garrison, I wasn't fired. I was replaced. This goes much higher than anyone knows.

-----


PC Principal's office, day. He's now the one explaining things to ... someone

PC Principal

I came to this town really thinking I could make a difference. I've been called a bigot towards persons with disabilities. I've been called... [stops for an instant] Pussy-crusher, because of the behavior of a very few individuals in my PC frat. [Nathan is shown] Jimmy Valmer is off the school newspaper. I want you to take over.

Nathan

Ooooh boy!

PC Principal

And I will be reviewing your paper to make sure nobody is ever attacked the way I was again.

Nathan

I think this will be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.

PC Principal

Jimmy almost made me lose confidence, but I know who I am. I know what I am!

PC bro 11

[voice only] Dude! Bro! [runs into the principal's office] Oh, bro, I went online to read a news story about immigrants being discriminated against.

PC Principal

Yeah?

PC bro 11

Well, and so I clicked on the headline and it turned out to be an ad for Reddi-Wip. so then I clicked on the button to make it go away, but then it was a link to another ad, and when i tried to cancel that, another window came up, and it was this! [approaches the desk and shows 

PC Principal

Dude! [stands up and whips his glasses off] What the fuck, bro?

PC bro 11

What does this mean, dude?

PC Principal

Bro! What the fuck, bro?!

-----


Back at the interrogation room...

Leslie

Do you like our school, Jimmy.

Jimmy

Uh yes, Leslie, I like our school very much.

Leslie

I like our school too. I like the kids who go there.

Jimmy

Uh huh. I'm starting to wonder something about you, Leslie.

Leslie

I'm starting to wonder about you. I mean, you seem like a nice kid, but... don't you feel like you could be happier? [this sets off an alarm in him]

Jimmy

Holy. Shit.

Leslie

What?

Jimmy

Can you excuse me for a moment?

Leslie

Okay. [Jimmy leaves the room for a moment]

Agent

Well Jimmy? What do you think?

Jimmy

[looks over his shoulder] Does she know she's an ad?

Agent 3

He can spot them.

Jimmy

Does she know she's an ad?!

-----


PC Delta house, night. PC Principal is looking at his monitor, on which is the same picture he saw at school. It's the same picture as that of Naughty Ninjas, but with additional details. The camera pans out to reveal that the picture is part of a State Farm insurance ad.

PC Principal

[softly, looking truly victimized now] What the hell is going on, bro?!

PC bro 19

[stops by and checks in on him] Bro?

PC Principal

Bro, what the hell is going on, bro?

-----


Caitlyn Jenner's car, Washington D.C., night.

Principal Victoria

If we're going back, remember: we don't know who we can trust.

Mr. Garrison

If they wanna mess with my town, I'll fuck every last one of them! Let's do this!

Caitlyn

Buckle up, buckaroos! [revs up the motor and drives off running over several people]

-----
