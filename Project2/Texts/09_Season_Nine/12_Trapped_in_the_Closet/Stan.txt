I can't spend any money. I'm saving up for that bike I want.  Let's just do something fun that's free. Well I can't spend any money.  Excuse me? Uh what do I have to do? Fine. L-look, is this a religion? Because my family is like, Catholic or something. Then how come that sign says "Church of Scientology"? ''Seven'' and two. Uhhh, sh-sure? Yeah? Yes. So how did I do? ...Huh?? I am?? I didn't know that! What what do I do? I'm totally depressed. I don't know. I'm not sure. But... I need two hundred and forty dollars. No, I found a self-help program that can cure me. But I'm completely miserable and these people can help! Neither did I! Don't you care that I'm depressed?! What if I become suicidal, or, or become an alcoholic like Grandpa??  ...well but... but that's ''my'' money. I hope so. Really? Thetan levels... So, this is gonna make me happy? What? Stan. I took out the garbage yesterday. Aagh!  I don't know!   Jesus Christ... Aw dude, I need to go to bed. Yeah, I know who you are. Well-h. I mean, you're not... you're not like as good as Leonardo DiCaprio, but you're okay, I guess. I mean, you're not Gene Hackman or that guy who played Napoleon Dynamite, but you're okay. Hey!  Dude, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. Dude, this is ''my room''!  Dad! Tom Cruise won't come out of the closet! Tom Cruise locked himself in my closet and he won't come out.  I just told him I thought the Napoleon Dynamite guy is a better actor than he is. Sure. I, I guess. But I don't know any of this stuff. Okay, I'll try. I just wish I could write in my room, but Tom Cruise won't come out of the closet.  Yeah, yeah! I can't. I'm writing a new sacred doctrine for my church. Cult? Scientology isn't a cult, Kyle. I've read all this stuff and it's based on fact. I did not! Those are rumors put out by people who are afraid because they don't know the secret truth. I can't tell you unless you pay for a few years of audit counseling! All I know is that I was depressed before, and now I found meaning! Neither did I! But now, if you guys can't accept this great thing I belong to, then I suppose we're no longer friends!  I wrote that um, our followers shouldn't fly in DC-8s anymore because they're too much like Xenu's evil cruisers. And I wrote that the evil Lord Xenu was recently broken out of galactic jail. And best of all, I wrote that all the Scientologists should no longer have to pay money to belong. I I realize that to really be a church, we can't charge people for help. ... Well, it's not about the money, it's about the message, right? But you said that there were- But then, why me? Why do you need me to write something so badly? Three million dollars? Yeah. Yeah, I get you. Uh, thanks. So, first of all, I've written that the brainwashed alien ghosts are actually from a galaxy called Nubanon. And uh, oh,  ...I ...I can't do this. Look, everybody, we're all looking for answer, you know. We all want to understand who we are and where we come from, but... sometimes we want to know the answers so badly that we... believe just about anything.  I'm not the reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard. And... Scientology is just a big fat global scam. What?? YOU told me it was a lie! Well fine! Go ahead and sue me! Well go on, then! Sue me! Okay, good! Do it! I'm not scared of you! Sue me!
