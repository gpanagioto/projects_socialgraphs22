Mom? Mommy? Where's my mommy? MOM! She said to wait for her by the... plastic boxes if I got lost. Mom? Where's my mom?  "Warm nuts", she said. Mom?! I lost my Mooohhm!  No way dude. No way. MOOOM! I can't find my mooom! Ahaha, okay okay it's getting old.  MOOOMMM! MOOOMMM!  Hey Kyle. What's up? Yeah, I figured. It's the day after the election, so you're probably sitting on the couch telling your little brother how great it is to live in a democratic society.  Listen, Kyle, could you come over for a second? I got somethin' I need to show you. Please, Kyle. It's kind of important. You happy with the election results last night, Kyle? Oh, that's such a democratic thing to say, Kyle. What if I were to tell you that I have something in my room that could change the entire election?  What if I did, Kyle? Pretty sweet, huh? What's it look like? Hundreds of thousands of votes from all the swing states. No, really. There are states full of swingers. Bunch of perverts if you ask me.   Now, believe it or not, Kyle, I actually need your help. But first you have to promise not to tell anyone. Run now, little firefly. It's all part of the plan. Thanks Mom,  I'll take that in the study. Do I have a study? I don't think I have a study. That's fine.  Hmmm, no. I'm sorry, but I know my rights. You can't search my room without a warrant. And I'm afraid I can't give you permission. Ey! You can't do that! Ey! I know my rights! Stop right now!  I was always told that... we lived in a country based on freedom. That the one thing that made America different was that government could never barge into our lives unwarranted. But it's all changing, isn't it? Ever since Obama was first elected, it's all changing. But where could they be? Where? And why would I care so much about the election results? So may questions, Kyle. So... little time.  Mm, mhm, mhm. They're nearby. Very safe and sound. I just might want to... alter our deal a little bit. Yes. Tell me again exactly what you plan on doing with it? Oh God damn it Kyle, I was just about to get what I wanted. So here's the deal, General Tso, Mr. President, when the Chinese make the sequels, I get to play the part of Luke Skywalker's son. Cartman Skywalker. Well then, I guess we're about to play a game of Chicken, General Tso.  Butters.  You just couldn't keep your mouth shut, could you Butters? I guess we learned that when it comes to ''Star Wars'', we can't trust anyone. Not the President, not the Chinese, and not you. Shhh, it's okay, Butters.  A place in town people barely even know exists. Cut the crap, Mouse! You only care about the election results because Romney would have been tougher on the Chinese! Trust me: they're somewhere nobody will ever find them! If you kill me, then Obama will stay President and you will lose ''Star Wars'' to the Chinese forever! I can get those at K-Mart! If you want me to switch sides, you'll have to do better than that! I want a part in the new movies! I get to be Luke Skeywalker's son. And there has to be a character called Jewbacca. Really? Well then, I suppose that making the votes public IS the right thing to do. I can get the ballots for you. But if I'm gonna smuggle them here, I'm gonna need a blaster and a tauntaun. Haha. Haha.   Yes, we must show these to the public! For democracy's sake, right Kyle? No! But Obama wasn't really elected! Don't you people care?!
