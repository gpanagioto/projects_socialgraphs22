Stand back, people. There's nothing to see here. Oh, yeah. There is that.   Hello, children. Dr. Mephesto needs one of you to help him out in his lab with the prehistoric ice man.

B L O O uh oh-O spells "blue" and that means that you will go to the lab and help out Mephesto and then we can all go home and watch ''Murphy Brown''.
