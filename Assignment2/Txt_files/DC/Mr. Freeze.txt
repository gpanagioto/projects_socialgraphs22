Years later, the character's origin story was revamped to match the one conceived by writer [[Paul Dini]] for ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', in which '''Dr. Victor Fries''' was a [[cryogenics]] expert in [[Gotham City]] who was caught in a laboratory mishap while attempting to cure his terminally ill wife, [[Nora Fries|Nora]]; the accident drastically lowered his body temperature to sub-zero levels, forcing him to wear a cryogenic suit in order to survive. Freeze's main goal remains to find a cure for his wife's illness, though his methods often bring him into conflict with [[Batman]]. This depiction of Mr. Freeze has since endured as one of the [[superhero]] Batman's most recurring enemies. He belongs to the collective of adversaries that make up Batman's central [[List of Batman Family adversaries#Classic rogues gallery|rogues gallery]].

===Introduction===
Mr. Freeze made his first appearance in ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' #121 (February [[1959 in comics|1959]]), and was created by Dave Wood, [[Sheldon Moldoff]] and [[Bob Kane]].<ref name="B#121">''Batman'' #121 (February 1959)</ref> From the time of his first appearance in 1959, the character was portrayed as one of many "joke" villains cast as stock enemies of Batman.<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/> He was originally called Mr. Zero in the comics,<ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |page=225}}</ref> but the producers of the 1960s ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television series renamed him Mr. Freeze and portrayed Batman addressing him as "'''Dr. Otto Schivel'''", and the name quickly carried over to the comic books.<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/> In the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Pre-''Crisis'']] continuity, it is explained that Mr. Freeze is a rogue scientist whose design for an "ice gun" backfires when he inadvertently spills cryogenic chemicals on himself, resulting in him needing sub-zero temperatures to survive.<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/>

===Origin story===
Originally called Mr. Zero,<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/> he was renamed and popularized by the [[Batman (TV series)|1960s ''Batman'' television series]], in which he was played by three different actors ([[George Sanders]], [[Otto Preminger]], and [[Eli Wallach]]).<ref name="Freeze 1">{{cite web|url=http://www.bat-mania.co.uk/main/villains/mr_freeze.php|title=Batmania UK: 1966 Batman: Villains: Mr. Freeze|access-date=2008-05-09|publisher=Bat-Mania}}</ref><ref name="Freeze 2">{{cite web|url=http://www.bat-mania.co.uk/main/villains/mr_freeze2.php|title=Batmania UK: 1966 Batman: Villains: Mr. Freeze 2|access-date=2008-05-09|publisher=Bat-Mania}}</ref><ref name="Freeze 3">{{cite web|url=http://www.bat-mania.co.uk/main/villains/mr_freeze3.php|title=Batmania UK: 1966 Batman: Villains: Mr. Freeze 3|access-date=2008-05-09|publisher=Bat-Mania}}</ref>

Nearly 30 years later, a television adaptation of Batman revitalized him once again. ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' retold Mr. Freeze's origin in "[[Heart of Ice (Batman: The Animated Series)|Heart of Ice]]", an episode by writer [[Paul Dini]]. The episode introduced his terminally ill, [[cryogenics|cryogenically frozen]] wife [[Nora Fries|Nora]], which explained his obsession with ice and need to build a criminal empire to raise research funds.<ref name="Heart of Ice">{{cite web|url=http://www.toonzone.net/anbat/btas/hoi.html|title=Heart of Ice|quote=Mr. Freeze targets the industrialist responsible for his wife's death.|access-date=2008-05-09|publisher=Toon Zone|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080428110756/http://www.toonzone.net/anbat/btas/hoi.html|archive-date=2008-04-28}}</ref> This more complex, tragic character was enthusiastically accepted by fans, and has become the standard portrayal for the character in most forms of media, including the comic book series itself, which previously had the character casually [[comic book death|killed off]] by the [[Joker (character)|Joker]].<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Chuck Dixon|Dixon, Chuck]]|penciller=[[Tom Lyle|Lyle, Tom]]|inker=[[Bob Smith (comics)|Smith, Bob]]|colorist=[[Adrienne Roy|Ray, Adrienne]]|letterer=Harkins, Tim|editor=O'Neil, Dennis|editor-link=Dennis O'Neil|story=The Funniest Thing Happened...|title=[[Robin (comic book)|Robin]] II: The Joker's Wild!|issue=#1|date=October 1991|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=[[New York City]]}}</ref>

This backstory was also made [[canon (fiction)|canon]] in the comics and has been the character's official origin in almost every incarnation of Batman until September 2011, when [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. Elements of this origin story were incorporated into the 1997 film ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'', in which he was portrayed by [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].<ref>{{cite news|first1= Steve| last1= Daly| first2= Anne| last2= Thompson|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,291605,00.html|title=A Tights Squeeze|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=March 8, 1996|access-date=May 8, 2008}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
===Pre-''Crisis''===
In order to create an ice gun, a scientist whose name remains unknown starts experimenting with a concentrated freezing solution. He suffers an unfortunate accident that changes his physiology, forcing him to live in environments below [[Absolute zero|zero temperature]]. He adopts the criminal identity of Mr. Zero. To be able to go out to the normal environment, Zero creates an [[Air conditioned clothing|air conditioned costume]], which helps him remain in cold temperatures, even in hot climates. Using this equipment, Zero gathers a small gang and starts a crime spree in [[Gotham City]], stealing mainly diamonds and other precious jewels. Mr. Zero is eventually confronted by the local vigilantes, [[Batman]] and [[Dick Grayson|Robin]]. Unable to stand against his cold weapons, the Dynamic Duo fails to stop Zero. They are captured by him and brought to his secret cold hideout, near the mountains. Trapped in blocks of ice, Batman and Robin learn Zero's plan to steal a large collection of gems. Batman eventually breaks a nearby steam pipe, causing steam to fill the hideout, melting the ice away and apparently curing Zero from his ailment. After this, Batman and Robin are able to capture the whole gang and bring Zero to the authorities.<ref name="B#121" /> 

After years of inactivity, Zero's condition apparently returns. Going back to a his life of crime, he changes his alias to Mr. Freeze and is forced to remain in cold temperatures once again. In this second exploit, Freeze redesigns his cryo-suit and improves his cryothermal gun. With a new gang, he starts a new series of crimes and steals valuable pieces of art. Similar to his first criminal activities, Freeze is eventually stopped by Batman and Robin.<ref>''Detective Comics'' #373</ref>

Long after this, Freeze becomes part of a [[Mock trial|mock criminal tria]]l,<ref>''Batman'' #291-294</ref> after which he changes his cryo-suit for one that allows him more mobility. Freeze eventually falls in love with a woman called Hildy. In order to slow her aging process, Freeze sets out to recreate the accident that transformed him. For his experiments, Freeze uses wealthy people in Gotham as test subjects, but all the efforts result in failure. The victims turn into frozen zombies, who follow Freeze's command. His new crimes alert the police and Batman. In the ensuing fight, Batman is only able to win when Hildy shows her true intentions and betrays Freeze, only to be encased in solid ice when her plan backfires.<ref>''Batman'' #308</ref> Freeze's next plan consists of freezing Gotham City by removing all the heat and transporting the energy to the neighboring city of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]]. Freeze is unable to accomplish his goal and is stopped by Batman and [[Superman (Earth-One)|Superman]].<ref>''World's Finest'' #257</ref> During one last attempt to freeze Gotham entirely, Mr. Freeze creates a large ice cannon. After robbing a bank, Freeze is confronted by Batman and the new [[Jason Todd|Robin]], who manages to defeat him with help from [[Vicki Vale]] and [[Julia Pennyworth]], whom Freeze previously captured.<ref>''Batman'' #375</ref>

===Post-''Crisis''===
Following the [[Crisis On Infinite Earths|Crisis]] rebooting the history of the [[DC Universe]], Mr. Freeze is revamped using a history similar to the one created by Paul Dini for ''Batman: The Animated Series''.<ref name="wf interview page 2">{{cite web |url=http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/heartofice/interview/02.php |title=''Heart of Ice'' interview "The Role of Mr. Freeze In The Animated Universe" page 2 â€“ Finding a Voice|access-date=2008-02-08 |publisher= worldsfinestonline.com}}</ref> Dr. Victor Fries, Ph.D. (surname pronounced "freeze") is a brilliant cryogenicist. As a child, he was fascinated with cryonic preservation and liked to freeze animals. His parents are horrified by his "hobby" and send him to a strict boarding school, where he is miserable and feels detached from humanity. In college, he meets [[Nora Fries|Nora]], the woman he ultimately marries.<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/>

Nora contracts a fatal illness 1Â½ years after Bruce Wayne becomes Batman, so Fries begins developing a freeze ray for [[List of locations of the DC Universe|GothCorp]] in order to preserve her in suspended animation until a cure can be found. Fries' boss Ferris Boyle decides to tell the mob about the gun, leading Batman to create a team of specialists to help him do his job better. As Fries puts Nora in suspended animation, Boyle interrupts and tampers with the experiment, resulting in an explosion that kills Nora. Fries survives, but the chemicals in the freeze ray lower his body temperature to the point that he must wear a cryogenic suit in order to survive. He swears revenge on those responsible for the death of his wife (whom he talks to often) and becomes Mr. Freeze, the first superpowered villain whom Batman faces in this continuity. Eventually, Batman's operatives find Freeze, who shoots one of them with his freeze gun, but Batman eventually apprehends him.<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/> Initially locked in [[Arkham Asylum]], Freeze was eventually transferred to the Gotham State Penitentiary, from where he escaped and attempted to steal technology from [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] until he was stopped and returned to prison by Batman.<ref>''Detective Comic'' #595</ref>

Freeze's crimes tend to involve freezing everyone and everything that he encounters<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/> so he never forges alliances with the other criminals in Gotham, preferring to work alone. On rare occasions, he has worked with another member of Batman's rogues' gallery, usually, as an enforcer for Gotham's mob bosses, such as the [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]] during his [[Batman: City of Crime|reign]]<ref>''Detective comics'' #804â€“806</ref> or [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]] during the [[Batman: Under the Hood|return]] of [[Jason Todd]].<ref>''Batman'' #635</ref><ref>''Batman'' #836</ref> In one of his notable team-ups, Freeze constructs a cryogenic machine for [[Hush (comics)|Hush]] so that Hush might take revenge on Batman, Freeze's equipment allowing Hush to preserve [[Catwoman]]'s surgically removed heart to use as a means of threatening her life.<ref>''Detective Comics'' #850</ref> After Batman's [[Batman RIP|death]], most of the Arkham inmates were [[Batman: Battle for the Cowl|freed]] by a [[Jeremiah Arkham|new Black Mask]]. Freeze was among them and he started working on a project called Ice-X Protocol when the GCPD tried to capture him. He stunned them with his gun and captured Gordon, taking him to his secret lair. Gordon managed to break free and defeat Freeze by causing an explosion that weakened Freeze. After his capture, Freeze was taken to [[Iron Heights]] prison.<ref>''Battle for the Cowl: Commissioner Gordon'' #1</ref> During his time with the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]], he fashions a sub-zero machine for [[Nyssa Raatko|Nyssa al Ghul]] in exchange for the use of her [[Lazarus Pit]]. He attempts to restore Nora to life without waiting for the adjusting needed in the pool chemicals; she returns to life as the twisted Lazara and escapes. She blames her husband for her plight, and she estranges herself from him.<ref>''Batgirl'' #69â€“70</ref>

===The New 52===
In September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, during the ''[[Night of the Owls]]'' crossover, the [[Court of Owls]] sends assassins known as Talons to kill 40 of the most important citizens of Gotham, including Mr. Freeze. [[Jason Todd|The Red Hood]], [[Starfire (Teen Titans)|Starfire]] and [[Roy Harper (comics)|Arsenal]] choose to save him, and subsequently remand him into [[Batgirl]]'s custody.<ref>{{cite comic| writer=[[Scott Lobdell|Lobdell, Scott]]|penciller=[[Kenneth Rocafort|Rocafort, Kenneth]]|inker=[[Kenneth Rocafort|Rocafort, Kenneth]]|letterer=Sienty, Dezi|editor=Chase, Bobbie|editor-link=Bobbie Chase|story=Last Regrets â€“ I've Had a Few|title=[[Red Hood and the Outlaws]]| volume=1|issue=#8| date=June 2012| publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=[[New York City]]}}</ref> ''Batman Annual'' (vol. 2) #1 introduces a new origin for Mr. Freeze. Here, Victor Fries' fascination with cryonics began when he was a boy and his mother fell through the ice of a frozen lake. The ice was able to keep her preserved long enough for help to arrive, thus sparking his lifelong obsession with the cold. It is later revealed that the accident left Fries' mother in constant pain, and Fries ended her suffering by pushing her into the same frozen lake. In this new origin, Nora was never Fries' wife. Her name was Nora Fields, a woman born in 1934. When Nora was 23, she was diagnosed with incurable heart disease, so her family placed her in cryogenic stasis hoping that a cure would be found in the future. Fries, having written his doctoral thesis on Nora, took on a position as a cryogenic researcher and technician at Wayne Enterprises, the facility that housed Nora's body. Eventually, he fell in love with Nora and became dedicated to finding a reliable method for slowly thawing cryogenic subjects. However, Bruce Wayne ordered the project to be shut down, as he began to feel uncomfortable with Fries' obsession with Nora. Furious, Fries hurled a chair at Wayne, who dodged the attack; the chair smashed into an array of cryonic chemical tanks, the contents of which sprayed onto Fries and transformed him into Mr. Freeze.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Scott Snyder|Snyder, Scott]]|penciller=[[Jason Fabok|Fabok, Jason]]|inker=[[Jason Fabok|Fabok, Jason]]|colorist=[[Peter Steigerwald|Steigerwald, Peter]]|letterer=Cipriano, Sal|editor=Marts, Mike|story=Night of the Owls: First Snow|title=Batman Annual|volume=2|issue=#1|date=July 2012|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=[[New York City]]}}</ref>

The Court of Owls uses Freeze's cryogenic-thaw formula to revive their Talons, and then they try to kill him. Freeze survives but is captured by the Red Hood and sent to [[Arkham Asylum]]. He escapes shortly afterward and rearms himself with the Penguin's help. Freeze decides to kill Bruce Wayne and takes Nora, whom he believes to be his wife so that they can leave [[Gotham City]] behind forever. Infiltrating [[Wayne Enterprises]], Freeze has a brief fight with [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]] and [[Damian Wayne|Robin]], but he subdues them. Then, Freeze goes to the penthouse, where he finds Batman and the frozen Nora. Batman defeats Mr. Freeze by injecting his suit with the thawing formula, which he had intended to use to revive Nora from suspended animation.

During the ''[[Forever Evil]]'' storyline, Mr. Freeze appears as a member of the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]] at the time when the [[Crime Syndicate of America|Crime Syndicate]] arrived from their world.<ref>{{cite comic| writer=[[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]]|penciller=[[David Finch (comics)|Finch, David]]|inker=[[Richard Friend|Friend, Richard]]|colorist=[[Sonia Oback|Oback, Sonia]]|letterer=Leigh, Rob| editor=Cunningham, Brian|story=Nightfall| title=[[Forever Evil]]|volume=1|issue=#1|date=November 2013| publisher=[[DC Comics]]| location=[[New York City]]}}</ref> [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|The Scarecrow]] later visits Mr. Freeze to let him know of the war going on at [[Blackgate Penitentiary]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer=[[Peter Tomasi|Tomasi, Peter]]|penciller=Kudranksi, Szymon|inker=Kudranksi, Szymon|colorist=[[John Kalisz|Kalisz, John]]|letterer=Sienty, Dezi|editor=Marts, Mike|story=City of Fear| title=Detective Comics|volume=2|issue=#23.3|date=November 2013| publisher=[[DC Comics]]| location=[[New York City]]}}</ref> The [[Man-Bat]]s are able to bring the remaining Talons to Mr. Freeze after Man-Bat and Scarecrow steal them from Blackgate.<ref>{{cite comic| writer=[[Peter Tomasi|Tomasi, Peter]]|penciller=[[Scot Eaton|Eaton, Scot]]|inker=Mendoza, Jaime|colorist=Delhouse, Andrew|letterer=Esposito, Taylor|editor=Gluckstern, Rachel|story=Batman Death March| title=[[Forever Evil|Forever Evil: Arkham War]]|volume=1|issue=#1|date=December 2013| publisher=[[DC Comics]]| location=[[New York City]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer=[[Peter Tomasi|Tomasi, Peter]]|penciller=[[Scot Eaton|Eaton, Scot]]|inker=Mendoza, Jaime|colorist=Dalhouse, Andrew|letterer=Lanham, Travis|editor=Gluckstern, Rachel|story=Das Bat!| title=[[Forever Evil|Forever Evil: Arkham War]]|volume=1|issue=#3|date=February 2014| publisher=[[DC Comics]]| location=[[New York City]]}}</ref> Mr. Freeze and [[Clayface]] later encounter the Rogues when they land in their territory.<ref>{{cite comic| writer=Buccallato, Brian|penciller=Hepburn, Scott|inker=Coehlho, Andre|colorist=Filardi, Nick|letterer=Sienty, Dezi|editor=Cunningham, Brian|story=Dark Knight| title=[[Forever Evil|Forever Evil: Rogues Rebellion]]|volume=1|issue=#3|date=February 2014| publisher=[[DC Comics]]| location=[[New York City]]}}</ref> Mr. Freeze tells [[Mirror Master]] II he is not interested in capitalizing on the bounty on their heads, only to use [[Weather Wizard]] to create optimal conditions for him to freeze Gotham.

===DC Rebirth===
In the ''[[Watchmen]]'' sequel ''[[Doomsday Clock (comics)|Doomsday Clock]]'', Mr. Freeze is among the villains that attend the underground meeting held by [[Riddler]] that talks about the Superman Theory. When Comedian crashes the meeting, Mr. Freeze's helmet is punctured by a bullet shot by an unseen combatant.<ref>''Doomsday Clock'' #6 (July 2018). DC Comics.</ref> In the "Ends of the Earth" story arc of ''All-Star Batman'', Freeze has awoken many people that have been held in cryogenic stasisâ€”using them as an army to steal resources for his research to cure his wife Nora, himself, and all of these peopleâ€”and plans to release deadly bacteria held in one of the world's oldest ice cores to make a new world, but [[Batman]] has injected himself with a cold-resistant virus that becomes airborne when his skin is exposed and is able to kill the spores.<ref>''All-Star Batman'' #7 (2017). DC Comics.</ref>

Several [[Floating timeline|years later]] due to the events in "[[Year of the Villain]]," [[Lex Luthor]] gives Mr. Freeze a vial that would cure and furthermore revive his frozen wife. Freeze had to kidnap several women who matched his late wife's characteristics, in both mental and physical states, going as far as modifying their DNA to hers in order to experiment with the vial before reviving his wife. In the end, it worked and his wife came back to life cured. She soon took up the name '''Mrs. Freeze'''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Detective Comics #1014 - Cold Dark World: Awake!|last1=Tomasi|first1=Peter|last2=Mahnke|first2=Doug|publisher=DC Comics|date=October 2019|issue=1014}}</ref>

==Powers, abilities, and equipment==
Like most Batman villains, Mr. Freeze plans his crimes about a specific [[Motif (visual arts)|theme]]; in his case, ice, snow, and cold. An accident caused Mr. Freeze to become genetically altered with a bizarre condition that has irreversibly frozen him to the bone, transforming him into a cold-blooded mutant whose body temperature must always be kept below zero. His altered biology caused his skin cells to become storage units for the cold to help his body chemistry to be comfortably chilled, allowing him to become both entirely immune and adapted to sub-freezing temperatures. Extraordinarily, his age progression has slowed drastically in a suspended animated state; some interpretations also suggest that the chemical he was soaked in was [[glycerol]], a cryo-protectant he intended to use for cryopreservation. His unique physiology makes him immune to most [[toxin]]s, [[bacteria]], and [[virus]]es.<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/>

Freeze has one weapon that is more powerful than his gun, suit, and other cryotechnology: his mind. A brilliant scientific genius with an incredible mind for invention, he is skilled in [[physics]], [[engineering]], [[genetics]], [[computer science]], [[chemistry]], and [[medical science]]. His science and technology are even as advanced as Apokilips or Lex Luthor's. His childhood obsession with cryogenics has led him to become one of the most gifted cryogenicists in Gotham. Victor was also able to build a cryonic life support machine for [[Catwoman]], whose heart was surgically removed by [[Hush (character)|Hush]], and was capable of inventing a wide variety of cryotechnology for his extensive array of cryogenic weapons and armor. Freeze is a remarkable medical scientist in his research on the pathology and neuroscience of Nora's neurological illness. His specialization in cryonics has successfully proven his thesis on immortality through suspended animation; preserving his wife in a frozen state to delay her illness until a cure could be found is the best example of his research.<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/>

Combined with his suit, Freeze's strength and durability are augmented to superhuman levels. Freeze's suit protected him from a bomb attack by the [[Ventriloquist (character)|Ventriloquist]]'s henchmen but the helmet of the armor was damaged by a sniper, causing the gases to leak due to the pressure. Freeze's strength and durability increased further after receiving a more advanced cryogenic armor, which was less heavy than the previous one, and was capable of withstanding gunshots and explosives. Freeze's most iconic weapon is his freeze gun, capable of creating gusts of cold that approach absolute zero. The gun is also capable of creating a "cold field" and imprison its opponents in a cocoon of ice.<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/>

In the ''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'' storyline, the demon [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]] granted Mr. Freeze the ability to generate subzero temperatures, no longer needing his freeze gun or refrigeration power suit. However, after his encounter with [[Kyle Rayner|Green Lantern]], [[Donna Troy]], and [[Purgatory (DC Comics)|Purgatory]] in Central Park, he reverted to his original subzero biology. He then gained a new subzero armor and weaponry.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = [[Mark Waid|Waid, Mark]]|artist = [[Howard Porter (artist)|Porter, Howard]]; [[Phil Jimenez|Jimenez, Phil]] and others| Title = Underworld Unleashed| Issue = #3| Date = November 1995 â€“ January 1996| Publisher = [[DC Comics]]| location=New York City}}</ref>

==Reception==
The character of Mr. Freeze has been analyzed as a stereotypical depiction of a villainous European in fiction.<ref>Georg Drennig, "Otherness and the European as Villain and Antihero in American Comics," in ''Comics as a Nexus of Cultures'', eds. Mark Berninger, Jochen Ecke, and Gideon Haberkorn (Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland & Company, 2010) 131-132.</ref> ''[[IGN]]''{{'}}s list of the Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time List ranked Mr. Freeze as #67.<ref name="IGNT100CBVATMF67" />

==Other characters named Mr. Freeze==
===Robot Mr. Freeze===
In ''[[Blackhawk (DC Comics)|Blackhawk]]'', Mr. Freeze appears as a robot created and controlled by Professor Thurman to pose as a villain so that Thurman could use his "Instant Freeze Icing Machine" invention to commit crimes without incriminating himself, but the plan is eventually foiled by the Blackhawks and Thurman is arrested.<ref>{{cite comic|artist=[[Dick Dillin|Dillin, Dick]]|penciller=[[Dick Dillin|Dillin, Dick]]|inker=[[Chuck Cuidera|Cuidera, Chuck]]|title=[[Blackhawks (DC Comics)|Blackhawk]]|issue=#117|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York City|date=October 1957}}</ref>

==Other versions==
===''Smallville Season Eleven''===
In the comic book adaptation of ''[[Smallville#Smallville Season Eleven|Smallville Season Eleven]]'', Mr. Freeze becomes an agent for the [[Intergang]] so he can obtain money to continue researching a way to save his wife Nora.

===''Batman: White Knight''===
Victor Fries appears in the 2017 series ''[[Batman: White Knight]]''. In this series, Victor Fries retires from his criminal lifestyle to focus on curing his wife's disease. It is later revealed that, due to his unique, cryogenically-dependent physiology, Fries's aging had been slowed considerably. His father was a member of the Nazi SS during the Second World War, but acted as a double agent, allowing America to stay one step ahead of [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] on the scientific front. As a result of this, a massive freeze cannon is constructed beneath a lighthouse off the coast of [[Gotham City]]. The superweapon is discovered by Neo-Joker (the second [[Harley Quinn]] who felt that by taking pills to retain his sanity, [[Joker (character)|Jack Napier]] was destroying the most beautiful part of himself) and is used to freeze most, if not all, of Gotham. Freeze is able to reverse the effects with the aid of [[Barbara Gordon|Batgirl]]. It is also revealed that Fries had been contacted by Batman in an attempt to secure the villain's aid to save the life of [[Alfred Pennyworth]]. Unfortunately, their efforts were in vain.
