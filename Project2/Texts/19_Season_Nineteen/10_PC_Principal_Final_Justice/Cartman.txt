What? Who would use a Cosby joke to push their own agenda? So what do we do now? Kyle, even if we thought it would help protect us, how are we all gonna get our hands on guns? Alright, cool, we got guns. So now what? Hey! Don't fall too hard, partner.  Do I look sweet, Butters? Yeah, I just want to finish this movie. Mom, I'm into this movie. I'm not going to bed right now. Chillax. I will go to bed  when this movie is over, Mom! Turn off the light and go back to bed. I'm staying up. I don't think so, Mom. No means no, Bill Cosby! Whoa, Mom, what the hell? Mom, put down the gun. Okay, I am going.  I'm going to bed now, Mom. Chillax.  Okay, I love you too, Mom. Night-night.  That's a nice gun right there. Yes, dude!
