Thanks, Pat! Yeah, they're all rooting for me.   Yeah.  Hi, everybody watching in South Park! Okay.  Okay I'd like a B, an N, and a G.  An O please. Uh... Well, uh... I know it but I don't think I should say it. Oh all right uh, I'd like to solve the puzzle!  Ohhh...  Right.  Well, gave it my best shot. Least we had a fun trip, huh, gang? Wha?! Well what was I supposed to do, Sharon? I thought I was gonna make $30,000! Stanley, the only reason Daddy used that word is that he thought he would win money. I want to apologize deeply and sincerely for using the N-word on Wheel of Fortune. And I want to assure you that I am not a racist, Reverend Jackson.  Uh well, like anybody else thought it was "naggers". I mean, right? Oh! Ah I will! I'm really down with  African-Americans. Y-Yes, absolutely. Hahh, thank you, Mr. Jackson, thank you. Huh? You want me to kiss your- Agh, oh, okay. I'll ahh...  Let's see here uh... Ooh! An African-American performer at the comedy club.  Yeah... No problem... I just... need some aspirin. Fine!  Words with venom, words that bind. Words used like weapons to cloud my mind. I'm a person. I'm a man. But no matter how I try, people just say "Hey! There's that 'ni**er' guy."  And so it is my honor to announce today the Randy Marsh African-American Scholarship Foundation.  Anyway, here's to a new start for us all. Thank you!  Awww! Awwww!  Whoa!  Please I, I don't want any trouble.  What do you want? What's going on here? No.  No no, I'm sorry, but I'm not... like you. I just said the N-word by mistake to win money. You said the N-word to a black man's face! That's way worse than what I did! No. Senators, I know it is not normally considered "American" to ban words.  But there is one slur that has caused so much damage that we believe it should finally be made illegal. I'm talking, of course, about the term "ni**er guy". Two words which by themselves can be harmless but which together... form a verbal missile of hate. Oh sure. Some people just use the term in jest - tell a ni**er guy joke or two thinking it's no big deal - but they don't realize it can lead to people using the term as an excuse for violence. Senators, I've learned to admit that I'm capable of having- slightly racist thoughts once in a while. Can anybody say they never do? How long will it be before you are all called "ni**er guys"?  We did it!
