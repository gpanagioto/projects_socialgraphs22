 Are you Alphonse Mephesto? We understand that you are currently in possession of the prehistoric ice man from 1996. We would like to...  we would like to offer our services in your experiments. Habitat? Amazing. He looks so much like us. Dr. Mephesto, we realize that scientific study is expensive. We want to help you make this project more... lucrative. It's easy. How so? He would be more scared on the outside. Do you think this stuff freaks him out? How do you think he'd react to what's happening in the government right now? No, that's impossible! How ''could'' he have? Damn it, ''Damn it''! Yes, and if he isn't found, we won't be able to use him for our military war- Right. Nothing.  Butlutlutlutlup! ''We'll'' never track him down on our own. This calls for some special assistance. We have to get him back. Well, can you do it? Well, where the hell is he? We've got to get him back to the lab.  Yeah. The train station? Then he's trying to ''go'' somewhere. The train!  Let's get him!  We've gotta stop that train!  Stop the train! I said, stop that train!  Cut him off! Where's the ice man?!  Damn! Well, so much for our plan to use the ice man to take over Sweden. What? Nothing!
