'''Harold Theopolis''' "'''Harry'''" '''Osborn'''<ref>''Spider-Man: Brand New Day Yearbook'', [[Marvel Comics]], 2008).</ref> is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]], commonly in association with the [[superhero]] [[Spider-Man]]. He first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #31 (December [[1965 in comics|1965]]), and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]].

Harry is the best friend of [[Peter Parker]] (Spider-Man's alter ego) and [[Flash Thompson]], one of the ex-boyfriends of [[Mary Jane Watson]], the son of [[Norman Osborn]], the husband of [[Liz Allan]] and the father of [[Normie Osborn|Normie]] and Stanley Osborn. He is the second character to assume the '''[[Green Goblin]]''' alias while one of his clones was amongst the many users of the [[Iron Patriot]] armor as the superhero '''American Son'''. He is also the creator of [[Gabriel Stacy and Sarah Stacy|Gabriel and Sarah Stacy]] who are both later to be operating as his [[demon]]ic [[revenant]] '''Kindred'''. 

The character has appeared in many adaptations of ''Spider-Man'' outside of the comic books, including various cartoons and video games. [[James Franco]] portrayed the [[Harry Osborn (Sam Raimi film series)|character]] in [[Spider-Man (2002 film series)|Sam Raimi's ''Spider-Man'' film trilogy]] (2002—2007), and [[Dane DeHaan]] portrays the character in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]'' (2014).

==Publication history==
Harry Osborn first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #31 (December 1965),<ref>{{cite book|last = Manning|first = Matthew K.|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = Spider-Man Chronicle Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2012|page = 31|isbn = 978-0756692360|quote= This monumental issue saw the first appearances of Peter's upcoming love interest Gwen Stacy, prospective best friend, Harry Osborn, and even the future super villain known as the Jackal.}}</ref> and was created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]].

In ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #122 (July 1973), Harry's father, [[Norman Osborn|Norman]], is killed off, and a subplot leading to Harry inheriting his father's identity as the [[Green Goblin]] is introduced. This subplot culminates in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #136 (September 1974). Writer [[Gerry Conway]] said that the idea of Harry Osborn becoming the Green Goblin stemmed in part from a desire to deal with the consequences of the psychedelic drugs Harry began using in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #96 (May 1971).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sacks |first1=Jason |last2=Dallas |first2=Keith |title=American Comic Book Chronicles: The 1970s |date=2014 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1605490564 |page=46}}</ref> Conway said that he had had experience with such drugs himself, and that "with psychedelic drugs, hallucinogens, if they've been misused, there is a potential for additional hallucinogenic experiences that are completely beyond your control or volition. I could imagine Harry getting hit by something like that, in the fragile emotional state following the death of his father, and losing touch with reality, as a result. Besides, I never had any intention of getting rid of the Green Goblin as a concept forever, so it all came together".<ref>{{cite journal|last= Williams|first= Scott E.|date= October 2010|title= Gerry Conway: Everything but the Gwen Stacy Sink|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 44| page= 14|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>

Harry dies in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #200 (May 1993). Artist [[Sal Buscema]] said that drawing the final two pages of this issue was a deeply emotional experience for him due to how long he had drawn the character, and felt it was appropriate that writer [[J. M. DeMatteis]] chose not to add any dialogue to those pages.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Aushenker|first=Michael|date=October 2010 |title=Not Amazing, but Spectacular|journal=[[Back Issue!]] |issue=44|page=60 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>

Several years later, the Spider-Man writers made plans to reveal that the mysterious villain Gaunt was Harry Osborn, who was still alive and had orchestrated the entire "[[Clone Saga]]", but an editorial edict prevented this from coming to fruition.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Veronese|first=Keith|date=October 2010 |title=Spider-Man: The Beginnings of the Clone Saga|journal=[[Back Issue!]] |issue=44|pages=69–77 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref> However, Harry was eventually revived in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #545 (December 2007). He received an entry in the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]] Update '89'' #5.

==Fictional character biography==
Harry is the only son of [[Norman Osborn]] and [[Emily Osborn|Emily Lyman]]. The circumstances of Harry's birth weakens Emily, and she dies after a long illness. Heartbroken, Norman becomes a cold and unloving father; Norman either contemptuously dismisses Harry or lashes out at him in fury.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man Annual'' #14. Marvel Comics.</ref> As a result, Harry spends much of his life trying desperately to earn his father's approval. Unbeknownst to him, however, Norman had traded his son's soul to the demon Mephisto in exchange for wealth and power, and Harry would be cursed for the rest of his life while Norman forgot the deal.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Amazing Spider-Man vol. 5 #72. Marvel Comics.|year=2021}}</ref>

Upon graduating from high school, Harry enrolls in Empire State University. Among the wealthiest students in the school, Harry soon becomes one of the most popular as well, despite his aloof manner. He has a [[clique]] of rich, popular students around him; one of these is the lovely [[Gwen Stacy]]. Gwen is intrigued by a new student: bookish, studious and painfully-shy Peter Parker. Harry takes a dislike to Parker; he resents the attention Gwen pays to Peter, and he assumes that Peter's standoffishness is snobbery. After confronting Parker, Harry realizes that Peter is merely shy and is also worried about his ailing aunt [[Aunt May|May Parker]]. Despite this rocky start, Harry and Peter became friends, eventually sharing an apartment.

Harry does not realize that his best friend is the [[superhero]] [[Spider-Man]], nor that his father became the [[supervillain]] Green Goblin in an accident while attempting to create a super-serum. Moreover, before he became friends with Harry, Spider-Man was unmasked and captured by Green Goblin.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #39 (August 1966)</ref> During the subsequent battle, an electric shock removed all memory of being Green Goblin from Norman's mind. Spider-Man then hid all evidence of Norman's double identity, to keep Harry from being hurt by the revelation.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #40 (September 1966). Marvel Comics.</ref>

However, Norman's Green Goblin persona resurfaces from time to time. These are difficult times for Harry, as his father's periodic episodes are unexplainable. He had experimented with drugs in his teens; but he escalates his usage, as well as trying ever-harder substances. This affects his mental stability and his relationships with his friends. Spider-Man uses this to his advantage during one battle with Green Goblin; he is able to stop the fight by showing Norman his son's emaciated condition, brought on by an accidental drug overdose. The sight shocks Norman so much that it brings him back to sanity.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #98 (July 1971). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Green Goblin===
[[File:Amazingspider136.jpg|thumb|upright|Harry Osborn as the new Green Goblin, battling Spider-Man on the cover of ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #136 by [[John Romita, Sr.]]]]
Harry is dumped by [[Mary Jane Watson]] due to being fed up with his self-destructive lifestyle. Disconsolate, Harry turns to drugs and overdoses on amphetamines. He recovers at home instead of at a hospital, as Norman wanted to keep the matter quiet, and a doctor diagnoses him with schizophrenia.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Amazing Spider-Man #121. Marvel Comics.|year=1973}}</ref> This tragedy, compounded by imminent bankruptcy, drives Norman over the edge. The elder Osborn kidnaps Gwen as bait for Spider-Man, and then throws her off the [[George Washington Bridge]] (or [[Brooklyn Bridge]]). In a vicious battle with Spider-Man, the Green Goblin accidentally impales himself on his own [[goblin glider]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #121-122 (June–July 1973). Marvel Comics.</ref> Harry Osborn secretly witnesses this. Wanting to protect his father's identity, he strips Norman Osborn's body of the Green Goblin costume. Blaming Spider-Man for his father's "murder", Harry, angry and mentally unbalanced, swears vengeance. Having inherited his father's company, Harry manages to get the business back in shape. One day, to his shock, he finds a Spider-Man costume in Peter Parker's apartment and realizes that his best friend is the man he blames for his father's death. Using his father's old equipment, Harry confronts Peter as the second Green Goblin.<ref>''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #136. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Not wanting to hurt Harry, Peter avoids fighting his old friend. After Spider-Man is able to thwart Harry's initial attempt on his life, Harry is knocked unconscious and taken into police custody. There, he raves that he is the true Green Goblin and Peter Parker is Spider-Man, but is dismissed as a lunatic.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #137. Marvel Comics.</ref> He is put in the care of criminal psychologist Dr. [[Bart Hamilton]] to extract the Green Goblin secrets from Harry through [[hypnosis]], and buries the knowledge deep within Harry's mind. Hamilton then raids one of Harry's hideouts and becomes the third [[Green Goblin]]. Meanwhile, Harry is released and considered cured. He sustains a concussion that makes him forget his knowledge of Spider-Man's identity and he and Peter rekindle their friendship.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

For a while, Harry's life seems back on track; his company begins turning profits once more, and he develops a romance with [[Liz Allan]] after they meet at the wedding of [[Betty Brant]] and [[Ned Leeds]]. Not long after the two are married, and eventually they have their son [[Normie Osborn]] named in memory of the boy's grandfather. Harry also gives his blessing to the marriage of Peter and Mary Jane Watson. However, Harry starts regaining his memories when he is blackmailed by the original [[Roderick Kingsley|Hobgoblin]] (Roderick Kingsley) with a package which contains evidence that his father was the original Green Goblin. When Hobgoblin learns he had raided all of Norman's hideouts, he leaves Harry alone, knowing he had nothing more to offer him. Later, Harry is forced to act as Green Goblin a few times, once to defeat the second [[Jason Macendale|Hobgoblin]] (Jason Macendale). This Hobgoblin is seeking the Goblin Formula that gave the Green Goblin superhuman strength; Harry is able to defeat him by doubling back during an aerial chase and emptying his entire supply of pumpkin bombs onto Hobgoblin. Harry even wonders if he could use the Green Goblin persona for a career as a superhero, but Peter convinces him that Green Goblin had too much baggage for such a role. Harry buries the Green Goblin menace within his mind once more and focuses on his business and family.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Web of Spider-Man #67. Marvel|year=1990}}</ref>

===Death===
This tranquility is shattered when the aftereffects of the "[[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]]" crisis sunder the barrier between Harry's conscious and [[subconscious]] minds. Once again, he remembers being Green Goblin—and his hatred of Spider-Man. Harry has now convinced himself that Peter Parker resents the Osborns' "stable family life" due to never having been wanted by his own parents or guardians, when in fact it was the complete opposite. He uses Peter's trust in him to capture him, and subjects him to hallucinogenic gases to psychologically torment him.<ref>''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #180-181. Marvel Comics.</ref> He finds himself unsatisfied with this revenge, however, and decides to kill Spider-Man. However, given the opportunity he proves unwilling to kill his best friend.<ref>''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #182-183. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Harry investigates his father's old hideouts and notes, and finally uncovers and ingests the formula for the original Green Goblin's superhuman strength. He then kidnaps his wife, son, and brother-in-law [[Molten Man|Mark Raxton]], terrorizing them in an old family mansion. Raxton manages to signal their location to Spider-Man who defeats the Green Goblin and turns him in to the police.<ref>''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #189. Marvel Comics.</ref> Spider-Man pushes for Harry to get psychiatric treatment from Dr. [[Ashley Kafka]], but he is ultimately transferred to [[Vault (Marvel Comics)|the Vault]].<ref>''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #190. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, the state is unable to put together a sufficient case against Harry, and after just a few weeks in prison, he is released.<ref>''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #199. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Harry discovers that his father developed an advanced version of the Goblin Formula, but was unable to test it before his final battle with Spider-Man. After testing it, he ingests the new formula. When he spies Spider-Man investigating his townhouse, Harry loses his temper and attacks him as the Green Goblin. He injects Peter with a drug that leaves him immobile and, in a fit of depression, activates timed explosives that he had planted throughout the townhouse, planning to kill both himself and Peter. However, when he realizes that Mary Jane and his son Normie are also in the townhouse, he is shocked back to his normal self. Harry rescues Mary Jane, Normie, and Peter before he collapses. He belatedly realizes that he did not test the new formula diligently enough, and that it is, in fact, lethal before he dies holding Peter's hand.<ref>''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #200</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=263}}</ref>

===Post-mortem===
Sometime before his death, Harry created a computer system with copies of his and Norman Osborn's minds programmed into it; after Harry's death, the computer system activates and abducts Normie Osborn with the intent of subjecting him to the Green Goblin Serum (the same one that had caused Harry's death) to make into the newest Green Goblin. This computer facsimile of Harry and its robotic drones (which resemble female versions of Green Goblin) were all destroyed by Spider-Man and the [[Molten Man]] who manage to save Normie from it.<ref>''Spider-Man: Legacy of Evil''. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, Harry had one last trick up his sleeve. Sometime before his final confrontation with Spider-Man, Harry had employed the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] to construct [[Life Model Decoy]]s of Peter's parents to play with his emotions. The plot ends with both constructs revealed as fakes when both "die", shattering Peter's mind. After nearly killing the Chameleon, Peter found a tape Harry had left before he died revealing his role in the plot and mocking Peter, demonstrating that Harry was as manipulative and cruel as his father when gripped by insanity. Peter goes temporarily insane from the shock, even briefly rejecting his identity until the return of his clone [[Ben Reilly]] snaps him back to reality.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #389</ref>

Some time later Spider-Man encountered another digital version of Harry's mind, this one a hologram created by a group of rebel Scriers. This group had reconstructed Harry from all available information about him in the hope of using him to manipulate Normie, who they wished to use as a weapon against his grandfather. This Harry, possessing all the memories of the original, refuses to entertain the idea of his son becoming a killer, and assists Spider-Man in defeating the leader of the group. He then explains to Normie that Spider-Man is not an enemy and thanks Peter for all his help over the years. As the hologram disappears the badly injured Scrier grabs Normie with the intent of killing him, but someone - implied to be Harry - grabs the Scrier from out of the darkness and breaks his neck.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Amazing Spider-Man Annual 2000, Marvel Comics|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>

==='Return from the grave'===
After [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]]'s manipulations of the timeline, details of Harry's death are seemingly retconned as being faked by [[Mysterio]] and his father who spirits his son away to Europe where he is held prisoner in several "rehab" clinics and believes that his son had relapsed into drug addiction, and this, in turn, led to his brief return to wearing the Green Goblin costume.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #581. Marvel Comics.</ref> Prior to Mephisto's alterations, Harry's body was exhumed and tested, indicating he was dead.<ref>''Spider-Man: Legacy of Evil'' #1 (June 1996). Marvel Comics.</ref> However, this is explained to have been a "genetic duplicate" provided by Mysterio to fool anyone who investigated later, indicating he was alive all along and Peter simply did not know.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #581</ref>

At some point, Harry is released from rehab and reunites with his friends. However, because Peter recruited [[Dr. Strange]], [[Mr. Fantastic]], and [[Iron Man]] to help him wipe out all evidence and memory of Spider-Man's secret identity (save from Mary Jane), Harry recalls his actions as the second Green Goblin but no longer remembers that Peter Parker is the web-slinger. His marriage to Liz Allan disintegrates and the two divorce. Harry engages in a string of relationships, several of which result in Harry marrying and divorcing in rapid fashion. He is in a relationship with Lily Hollister. Harry tries to help Lily's father in the latter's bid for Mayor of New York by funding her father's campaign with his dwindling finances.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #545</ref>

Harry is also one of the leading suspects for the secret identity of a new Goblin. In the "[[New Ways to Die]]" story arc, [[Menace (Marvel Comics)|Menace]] battles Norman Osborn and is infuriated when Norman states that all he cares about is killing Spider-Man. Norman dons the Green Goblin costume and mentions that Harry has been in the Green Goblin's lair. Norman calls Harry, who realizes from Norman's distorted voice that Norman is wearing the Green Goblin suit. This horrifies and disgusts Harry, who vows to stop his father. Harry angrily confronts his father, who wants Harry to follow his legacy and become a greater man. The confused Harry is saved by Spider-Man. Spider-Man, who wants to beat Norman senseless, stops when he sees an area for human testing. Harry is claimed to be the one responsible for the atrocious acts, although he attempts to plead innocence. Harry later states that he wants to talk to Peter, who moments earlier was kissed by Lily, and is seen leaving with a mysterious canister labelled "Prometheus X-90".{{issue|date=January 2013}}

Prometheus X-90, it is revealed later, was developed as a successful cure for Mark Raxton's condition as Molten Man. The only human test subject was Charlie Weiderman, the short-lived second Molten Man, and the only person on whom the serum could be tested. After the cure is administered, Liz finally forgives Harry and gives him back the wedding ring, which she originally claimed she lost.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #582. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Renting out all of [[Liberty Island]], Harry takes Lily there and, at the top of the [[Statue of Liberty]], he gets down on one knee and proposes to her.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #583. Marvel Comics.</ref> Lily rejects his proposal because she is not sure where their relationship will lead, which surprises Harry. He later goes to her place to check up on her, and as he enters the room he is surprised to discover Lily wearing the Menace costume.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

She found a hidden door in his closet and one of his old journals. She begins giving him a hard time about whining so much about his father. Harry thinks her behavior is because she is sick. She continues to tell him she uncovered one of Norman's secret rooms described in the journal. This explains why she kissed Peter after the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] attacked; he almost found the secret trigger to open the room. When she first entered the room, she found the Green Goblin's equipment and some experiments. Knocking over some chemicals, she absorbed them and is now able to transform at will. She explains that she discovered Menace's attacks against her father gives him more public support. She also tells him that she accepts his marriage proposal. After their talk, Harry enters one of his father's weapons caches, takes a glider (filled with bombs and winged bombs), a pair of Goblin gloves, a sword, and a dart gun containing an unknown chemical.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #586. Marvel Comics.</ref> In the midst of a battle between Menace and Spider-Man, Harry confronts and shoots her with that chemical, which is a type of antidote that reverts her back to her human form. He saves Spider-Man from the crowd and leaves.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #588. Marvel Comics.</ref> Lily is incarcerated but later escapes, leaving Harry her ring and a note.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

===''Dark Reign''===
Harry is approached by Norman with the offer of a job within the [[Dark Avengers]]. Harry initially declines, but accepts his father's offer after learning that Lily Hollister is pregnant.<ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Joe Kelly (comics writer)|Joe Kelly]] | Penciller = [[Phil Jimenez]] | Inker = [[Andy Lanning]] | Story = [[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]] | Title = The Amazing Spider-Man | Issue = #595 | Date = May 2009 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> Norman welcomes Harry into Avengers Tower, wanting to make his son into the '''[[Iron Patriot|American Son]]'''. Harry is shown to have an ulterior motive, however, based on his compulsion to protect Lily and his child. Disabling the camera in his room, Harry sneaks off.<ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Joe Kelly (comics writer)|Joe Kelly]] | Penciller = Paulo Siqueira | Inker = Amilton Santos | Story = [[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]] | Title = The Amazing Spider-Man | Issue = #596 | Date = June 2009 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> He finds a cure for Lily's condition that will be safe for both Lily and the baby, but Lily pushes him away. Lily reveals that it is a ruse to coerce Harry into taking on the American Son armor, whom Norman had plotted would die in a tragedy to increase sympathy for Norman and the Dark Avengers. Lily also reveals that the baby is not Harry's but, in fact, Norman's. In retaliation for this, Harry dons his American Son armor, and fights Norman in his [[Iron Patriot]] armor.<ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Joe Kelly (comics writer)|Joe Kelly]] | Penciller = Paulo Siqueira, [[Marco Checchetto]] | Inker = Paulo Siqueira, Marco Checchetto, Amilton Santos | Story = [[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]] | Title = The Amazing Spider-Man | Issue = #598 | Date = June 2009 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> During the battle, Norman declares that Harry is no longer his son, and that Norman has bred a better child to replace the 'failure' of Harry. After further taunts from Norman, Harry lashes out and defeats his father, declaring "I was never your son!". When Harry has the option of killing Norman, Spider-Man tells him to decapitate Norman, since his father's healing factor may repair a blow to the head. Spider-Man also cautions Harry that killing Norman will cause Harry to "become the son Norman always wanted". Seeing what he may become with his actions, Harry instead backs down, and turns away from his father forever.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Amazing Spider-Man #599. Marvel Comics|year=2009}}</ref>

Harry is next seen in a psychiatrist's office, claiming to be getting over the effects of a medical treatment he received. The doctor offers to prescribe him [[oxycodone]] but it is not revealed if Harry takes the prescription.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #599. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Afterwards, Harry is cut off financially and is forced out of his penthouse apartment. He moves into Peter's old room at May Parker's.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #604. Marvel Comics.</ref> He also begins secretly dating Amy Reilly (Peter's cousin).<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #605. Marvel Comics.</ref> After May returns and is corrupted by [[Mister Negative]], she kicks Harry out of the house, forcing him to move in with Mary Jane Watson.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #618-619. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Heroic Age===
After Norman's [[Siege (Marvel Comics)|fall]], the American Son armor is stolen and the police begin questioning Harry, as only someone of the Osborn bloodline can use the American Son armor. Harry is then shot in the chest by [[Gabriel Stacy and Sarah Stacy|Gabriel Stacy]], claiming that Norman gave Harry a better life.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man Presents: American Son'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, Harry is saved by American Son and taken to a hospital. After Harry recovers from his wounds, he is escorted home by police. Fearing the damage that could be done with the American Son armor and perplexed by his encounter with Gabriel, Harry decides to figure things out on his own. After enlisting the help of a talented reporter named [[Norah Winters|Norah]] from Frontline, Harry decides to visit Norman, as only he would know about Gabriel. Harry and Norah eventually visit the Raft where they find Norman in his cell, consumed by madness. Harry demands to know about Gabriel, but Norman is unresponsive. Frustrated, Harry and Norah begin to leave, but before they exit Norman briefly returns to his senses and tells Harry that Gabriel is indeed Norman's son.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man Presents: American Son'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Trying to make sense of everything, Harry visits May Parker's work where he plans to volunteer. On his way, he realizes that he is being followed by the FBI. It is then revealed through FBI security footage that Gabriel is the one who stole the American Son armor and has been using the armor all along. Meanwhile, Gabriel confronts the American Son armor and is revealed to have developed a split personality similar to Norman's after his exposure to the Goblin Formula. This split personality explains to Gabriel that it represents all that is good in his soul and will use the American Son armor to undo each of Gabriel's crimes. After an intense psychological battle, Gabriel appears to gain the upper hand and proceeds with his plan.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

Still attempting to understand Gabriel's plans, Harry determines that, in order for Gabriel to truly hurt him, he will attempt to abduct an innocent person and lay a trap. Harry then rushes to find Norah. Meanwhile, the police arrive at Gabriel's hideout, but are unable to rescue Norah because of the American Son's interference. Harry manages to sneak in through one of his father's secret tunnels and confronts his half-brother.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man Presents: American Son'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> As the police prepare to make another attempt to save Norah, Harry frees her and gets the young reporter to safety. With Norah out of harm's way Gabriel and Harry engage in an epic battle. During the fight, Harry attempts to convince Gabriel that Norman is evil and that attempting to follow in his footsteps is madness. Gabriel refuses to listen and continues his attempts to kill Harry. Saddened by his brother's choice, Harry hacks the American Son armor and knocks Gabriel unconscious. The battle causes the warehouse to go up in flames, trapping Gabriel and Harry inside, but Spider-Man arrives and saves them. Afterward, Norah visits Harry in his coffee shop, and notices a bottle of oxycodone in Harry's things. Troubled by what she finds, Norah concludes that Harry has a drug problem and resolves to help him through it.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man Presents: American Son'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After many near-encounters, [[Carlie Cooper]] and Peter Parker meet at the coffee shop. Harry and MJ are there and the four are talking when Lily bursts through the wall, followed by an attacking team of supervillains.

As Harry realizes that, Augustus kidnaps Betty. Harry must do it himself to save Betty and the other captured superhumans, knowing that he may be captured soon enough, but manage to contact Spider-Man with Parker Industries' webware created by Clayton/Clash before Regent captures him immediately.

Marvel Comics.</ref>

Later in the storyline "[[Go Down Swinging]]", Harry returns, using the Osborn name after his father again terrorizes the city as the Red Goblin using the [[Carnage (character)|Carnage]] symbiote before being imprisoned once more, even after Emily Osborn turns up alive. He is determined to redeem his family's name from his father's villainous legacy and to be a responsible parent to his sons.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #800. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Kindred===
It is revealed over the course of [[Nick Spencer]]'s run as writer on ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' that, upon dying, Harry's soul was transported to [[Hell]], where he encountered the demon [[Mephisto (Marvel Comics)|Mephisto]], who labels him as the '''Goblin Prince'''. The demon asks Harry why he never told Peter on his deathbed any of the schemes he had set in motion to torture him after his passing, with Harry confessing that there was no time, and that he was ashamed.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #74</ref> Harry's soul is kept in hell tortured by demons while the clone version maintains a life on Earth.

Many years later, a demon, going by the name of '''Kindred''', rose through the ranks and ultimately hand picked [[Mysterio]] to assist him in carrying out a plan of retaliation against Peter Parker, whom Kindred held accountable for an unpardonable sin. When Kindred meets with [[Norman Osborn]] in Ravencroft, Norman's Cletus Kasady persona states to Kindred that he has a message for him from Norman, who states that he is "so proud of him".<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #31. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Norman, cleansed of his sins via Sin-Eater, claimed to the clone of [[Ashley Kafka]] that Kindred was his son,<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #50. Marvel Comics.</ref> and when Kindred revealed itself to Peter it had the face of Harry Osborn. Kindred torments Peter by showing him the corpses of his dead friends and family, putting Peter's soul through the reenactment of Harry Osborn's return,<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #53. Marvel Comics.</ref> and killing him over and over again as Peter experienced flashbacks to better times with his friends.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #54. Marvel Comics.</ref> Norman is able to capture Kindred with the help of Kingpin and speaks to it believing it to be the true Harry, voicing regret over having birthed the sickness in Harry's mind. Planning to redeem the Osborn name, Norman states to Kindred that he will find the truth that he talked about. Spider-Man arrives stating to Norman that he would like to talk to him,<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #56. Marvel Comics.</ref> and declares he is finished with Harry forever.<ref name=":0">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #57. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, after MJ helps Peter talk through the incident, Peter admits he was lying when he said that and begs a vision of Kindred to tell him what to do.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Amazing Spider-Man vol. 5 #53. Marvel Comics.|year=2021}}</ref>

Carlie Cooper is asked to investigate the corpses dug up by Kindred, and is particularly horrified on uncovering an extra one. At that moment she is captured by Kindred <ref name=":0" /> and later awakens to find herself a caged prisoner. She finds the non-demonized Harry Lyman is her cellmate, and he tells her that they have no chance of escape.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #66. Marvel Comics.</ref> Carlie learns from Harry that he was lured to Europe by Kindred after following a trail of transactions from several dormant Oscorp bank accounts. Arriving at one of his father's former real estate holdings (which bears a resemblance to the building that raised Sarah and Gabriel Stacy), Lyman was attacked and captured by Kindred. He has remained a prisoner for many months. Unbeknownst to Harry, Carlie is keeping something from him...the identity of the corpse she discovered in the morgue belongs to Harry Osborn himself.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #70. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Carlie attempts to motivate Lyman, reminding him of his family. Harry tells her this is not the first time he has failed them, and that no matter how happy he is, how hard he tries to put things right, something is always there to remind him that none of it is real, and that none of it will ever last. After more coaxing from Carlie, Harry suddenly notices that the door to their cell is open and suggests there is a way to escape<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #71. Marvel Comics</ref> Harry and Carlie race through Kindred's catacombs, and find that some of the walls are easy to push over. They find Carlie's morgue on the other end of one, containing a body. Carlie warns Harry not to look, but he does anyway. It is also revealed through flashbacks dating back to Harry's childhood that the cause of most of Harry's personal problems, from addiction to insanity, comes from him having a tortured soul which was traded to the demon Mephisto by Harry's father in exchange for a more prosperous quality of life, which Norman had been struggling to provide for him and his son. Norman is reminded of these deeds when he visits the house in Europe, discovering two cloning pods as well as the old [[artificial intelligence]] unit which houses Harry's brain waves. This version of Harry taunts his father<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #72. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The A.I. Harry reveals to his father that his half-siblings [[Gabriel Stacy and Sarah Stacy|Gabriel and Sarah Stacy]] are not in reality Norman's children, and that he never had an intimate relationship with [[Gwen Stacy]]. Sarah and Gabriel were part of a major cloning conspiracy orchestrated by him, Mysterio, Mendell Stromm, and The Chameleon. Several versions of the twins were created, but each succumbed to cellular clone degeneration and died. When the latest models were perfected, they were sent out into the world to confront Peter. Gabriel  had one further model created that became involved in the ''American Son'' storyline. Now both twins have become host bodies for the AI Harry, which is why they have been taking Harry's form and have his memories, and it is revealed there were two Kindreds all along. Harry's A.I. reveals Mysterio rewired his father's memories to make him believe his son had always survived, when in truth he did not. Harry Lyman, uncovering his own body, confesses to Carlie that he knew all along he was never the true Harry, after he and Carlie find a portal that transports them back to his home, Harry checks in on a sleeping Liz and Normie before equipping himself with a goblin glider and pumpkin bombs, and heads back to Kindred's base to confront his final destiny.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #73. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In a final battle with the Kindreds, Norman reveals the A.I. Harry had been influenced by Mephisto the entire time and apologizes to Harry for selling his soul. Harry then tells Peter he "made up" the twins and fights with his friend against them. During the battle Harry tells Norman to get to safety; Norman is shocked at this to which Harry replies "Guess the apple fell kinda far from the tree." When Harry steps between Norman and a blow from Gabriel's Kindred body, he is fatally wounded. Collapsing into Peter's arms, Harry tells Peter this was always how it was "meant to be" and dies. Doctor Strange decides to gamble with Mephisto for the fate of Harry Osborn's soul and succeeds. His victory exorcises Mephisto from the twins, allowing them to degenerate and pass on for a final time, and Harry's soul is freed from Mephisto's grasp.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man Vol.5 #74. Marvel Comics.''</ref> Peter and MJ grieve the loss of their friend.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Amazing Spider-Man vol. 5 #75. Marvel Comics.|year=2021}}</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
For most of his life, Harry Osborn had no superhuman abilities.

===As Green Goblin===
After exposing himself to his father's formula, he takes the reins of the second Green Goblin, causing him to become much stronger, cunning and agile. However, he seemingly lost his powers after he returns. The glider he carries has swords, along with usual Goblin technology.

===As American Son===
Harry's clone also had temporary access to the American Son armor.

===Harry A.I/Kindred===
When the Harry Osborn AI created the Kindred twins, the assistance of Mephisto bestowed the twins with the demonically enhanced capabilities of immortality, super-strength, and control over the centipedes like the ones that can protrude out of them. In addition, they can perform magic and revive the dead.

==Other versions==

Having secretly survived his final battle with Spider-Man, and still unhinged due to the side-effects of the Goblin formula, Harry carries out a vengeful campaign against the Spider-Men with the aid of [[Kaine Parker|Kaine]]. His plans also include the cloning of his deceased father, who apparently was killed by his Goblin Glider in this reality. Harry soon heads out to attack Ben Reilly in the guise of the Green Goblin. His plans are thwarted when Kaine switches sides. The Norman clone, who is not insane due to not being exposed to the Goblin Formula, tries to convince Harry to stop before sacrificing himself by jumping in front of the moving Goblin Glider (akin to Ben Reilly's death in the main universe). The series concludes with an irate Harry swearing vengeance.<ref>''Spider-Man: Clone Saga'' #4-6</ref>

Norman convinces Harry to attack Miles Warren as the '''Black Goblin''' to retrieve his clone, but Harry discovers that Miles also cloned Peter and Gwen Stacy in the process. Harry realizes Norman cloned Peter because Norman still considered Peter the more worthy heir and attacks him. After Peter convinces Harry of his father's manipulations, Harry blows up the facility, killing all the clones except Peter's. However, Miles reveals that the "Gwen" Peter was with was actually her clone while the real Gwen died in the explosion, leaving Harry wracked with guilt. By one year later, he has broken up with Mary Jane and left her with a significant amount of money before disappearing.

Chaos erupts after he discovers that Peter is supposedly the clone while Ben is the original. When Otto attempts to kill them both, Harry sacrifices himself to save Peter. As he dies in Peter's arms, he apologizes for being weak with Otto and his father, though Peter reassures him that he was not.
