And now children, our friend Mr. Hat is going to tell us all about genetic engineering. Yes Kyle. Well, uh, ye, yes, I suppose you could. You could, splice elephant genes with a dog, or cat, or a, pot-bellied pig genes. Well, spank my ass and call me Charlie. Isn't this exciting, two A+ students in a cloning war. You know, you boys might want to visit the Genetic Engineering Ranch outside of town for some help. And you could both use this for your science fair projects next month. Uh, uhuh, Stanley, can I talk to you for a minute? I couldn't help but notice that black eye you have. Are there problems at home? Oh dear. Here Stanley, sit down, have some cocoa, and tell your friend Mr. Hat all about it.  Your sister?! Oh for Pete's sake, don't be such a little wuss. Stop wasting Mr. Hat's time with pansy little foo-foo problems, and, ''give me back my cocoa!'' Stan, are you wearing a different hat? Hey, I know a certain young man who's itching for a detention. Aaaaaah! Ooooh. Stanley, what the hell has gotten in to you?! You have got severe lunchroom duty mister! Yeah, you wait 'til your father hears about this. Everyone, let's give Casey and his weed a big hand. Okay Kyle, we're ready to see your science project. Oh, well then I guess you get an 'F'. Okay, Terrance, I know the class can hardly wait to see your science fair project. Oh, Mr. Hat, isn't it beautiful. Ohh, uh, gee, isn't that an amazing coincidence? Hmm, what are the odds of that?
