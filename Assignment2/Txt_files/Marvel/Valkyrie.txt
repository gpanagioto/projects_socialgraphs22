'''Valkyrie''' is a fictional [[superheroine]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character, based on the [[Norse mythology|Norse mythological]] figure [[Brynhildr]], was created by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[John Buscema]]. First appearing in ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' #83 (December 1970),<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=391}}</ref> Valkyrie became a mainstay of the superhero team known as the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] and a close ally and one-time love interest of the superhero [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]].

Valkyrie, also known by her [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]] name '''Brunnhilde''', was selected by [[Odin (comics)|Odin]] to lead his personal [[Military organization#Commands, formations and units|unit]] of [[shield-maiden]]s, the [[Valkyrior]]. Renowned for her prowess in battle, Valkyrie is often accompanied by her [[Flying horses|winged horse]] [[Aragorn (comics)|Aragorn]] and carries the enchanted sword Dragonfang. In the 2010s, Valkyrie became a founding member of the [[Secret Avengers]] and co-leader of the [[Fearless Defenders]] with [[Misty Knight]]. Among Valkyrie's other aliases are Barbara Norris, Samantha Parrington, Sian Bowen and [[Annabelle Riggs]], who all, at one point, hosted her spirit. Samantha Parrington, one of Valkyrie's previous hosts, later received superhuman powers and became a member of the Defenders herself.

[[Tessa Thompson]] portrays the character in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] films ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'' (2017), ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019), and ''[[Thor: Love and Thunder]]'' (2022).

[[Roy Thomas]] publicly stated the character's creation, "I wanted a sort of female [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], but of course at first I just made her a disguise of the [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]] in THE AVENGERS.

==Fictional character biography==
Brunnhilde was selected by [[Odin (comics)|Odin]], King of the Gods of the realm of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]], to lead the [[Valkyrior]] (the Choosers of the Slain), a group of warrior goddesses who would appear over the battlefields of mortal worshippers of the Asgardian gods and choose which of the fallen were worthy to be taken to [[Valhalla]], the land of the honored dead. Brunnhilde served capably in this capacity for centuries.

According to a sentient, disembodied eye that claimed to have once belonged to Odin, the Asgardian monarch once gave his son [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] the mortal identity of the warrior Siegmund. Circumstances forced Odin to decree that Siegmund must be slain. Brunnhilde, recognizing that Odin was acting against his true wishes, sought to protect Siegmund, but Odin himself then caused Siegmund's death.<ref>{{cite comic |writer=Thomas, Roy |penciller=[[Keith Pollard|Pollard, Keith]] |inker=Stone, Chic |story=From Valhalla--A Valkyrie! |title=[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] |issue=296 |date=June 1980}}</ref> Brunnhilde helped Siegmund's pregnant lover, Sieglinde get to safety. As punishment for her defiance, Odin removed Brunnhilde's Asgardian powers and immortality and cast her into a trance.<ref>{{cite comic |writer=Thomas, Roy |penciller=Pollard, Keith |inker=Stone, Chic |story=The Sword of Siegfried! |title=Thor |issue=#297 |date=July 1980}}</ref> She was eventually awakened by Siegfried, the son of Siegmund and Sieglinde and another mortal incarnation of Thor.<ref>{{cite comic |writer=Thomas, Roy; [[Ralph Macchio (comics)|Ralph Macchio]] |penciller=Pollard, Keith |inker=Stone, Chic |story=Dragon's Blood! |title=Thor |issue=#298 |date=August 1980}}</ref>

Brunnhilde and Siegfried became lovers, and she made him invulnerable so long as his back was not turned on his foe. Siegfried fell under the influence of magic and betrayed her.<ref>{{cite comic |writer=Thomas, Roy; Gruenwald, Mark |penciller=Pollard, Keith |inker=Stone, Chic |story=Passions and Potions |title=Thor |issue=#299 |date=September 1980}}</ref> He was later murdered, and Brunnhilde, still in love with him, leapt into his blazing funeral [[pyre]] (this part of her background was based on the [[Völsungasaga|Volsunga saga]]). Odin restored both of them to life, restoring their Asgardian roles and powers, but removing their memories of their earthly lives.<ref>{{cite comic |writer=Gruenwald, Mark; Macchio, Ralph |penciller=Pollard, Keith |inker=[[Gene Day|Day, Gene]] |story=Chapter One Twilight of the Gods! |title=Thor |issue=#300 |date=October 1980}}</ref> It is unclear how much truth, if any, there is to this account by the eye.

Brunnhilde and her fellow Valkyries continued to gather heroic mortal warriors for Valhalla until roughly a millennium ago, when Odin was forced to cease virtually all interaction with the Earth in accordance with a pact that he and the leaders of Earth's other pantheons of gods made with the extraterrestrial [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]].<ref>{{cite comic |writer=Gruenwald, Mark; Macchio, Ralph |penciller=Pollard, Keith |inker=Day, Gene |story=Chapter Two Whatever Gods There Be... |title=Thor |issue=#300 |date=October 1980}}</ref> From then onward, the Valkyries could only choose slain heroes from among fallen Asgardian warriors. Brunnhilde was bitter over being barred from choosing warriors on Earth and roamed Asgard in pursuit of something meaningful to do. In a tavern on the outskirts of Marmoragard, Brunnhilde encountered [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Amora the Enchantress]], who offered her a life of adventure. For several weeks Brunnhilde accompanied the Enchantress on her conquests. Brunnhilde soon discovered Amora's immoral nature and tried to end their partnership. In response the Enchantress trapped Brunnhilde within a mystic crystal of souls.<ref name="Defenders108" /> While Brunnhilde's body remained in suspended animation, her immortal soul became Amora's plaything. Over the centuries the Enchantress used Brunnhilde's spiritual essence to give the Valkyrie's powers to herself or to her pawns.

Specific instances of Amora's exploitation of the Valkyrie before recent years are not yet known. The first time the Enchantress assumed the Valkyrie's physical aspect in recent years was in a plot to lead a handful of female superhumans against the male [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] as the [[Lady Liberators]].<ref name="Avengers83" /> Her true identity was discovered and her plan thwarted. Months later, the Enchantress bestowed the Valkyrie's power upon a socialite named Samantha Parrington in an attempt to get revenge on the [[Hulk]].<ref name="Hulk142" />

[[File:ValkyrieAvengers83.png|thumb|left|upright|Cover of ''The Avengers'' #83 (Dec. 1970) by [[John Buscema]] and [[Tom Palmer (comics)|Tom Palmer]]]]

Finally, a woman driven mad by being trapped in another mystical dimension, Barbara Norris, was given the Valkyrie's power and consciousness by the Enchantress to help her then-allies, the group of superhumans called the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], escape from the clutches of the sorceress Casiolena. Amora did not undo her spell on Norris after Casiolena's defeat.<ref name="Defenders4" /><ref name="Sanderson" /> As a result, Norris' body now possessed Brunnhilda's consciousness, appearance, and powers, while Norris' own mental essence was trapped in Brunnhilde's real body in Asgard. Aware that she was an immortal essence in a mortal woman's body, the Valkyrie briefly left the Defenders in an attempt to discover Barbara Norris' past.<ref>{{cite comic |writer=[[Len Wein|Wein, Len]] |penciller=Buscema, Sal |inker=[[Dan Green (artist)|Green, Dan]] |story=Power Play! |title=The Defenders |issue=#17 |date=November 1974}}</ref> She meets Norris' father, Alvin Denton, shortly before his death and then returns to the Defenders.<ref>{{cite comic |writer=Gerber, Steve |penciller=Buscema, Sal |inker=Esposito, Mike |story=Name That Doom! |title=[[Marvel Two-in-One]] |issue=#7 |date=January 1975}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic |writer=Gerber, Steve |penciller=Buscema, Sal |inker=Colletta, Vince |story=The Woman She Was...! |title=The Defenders |issue=#20 |date=February 1975}}</ref>

It was not until a minor Asgardian warrior named [[Ullr|Ollerus]] attempted to take over Valhalla that the Valkyrie's two mixed aspects met for the first time.<ref name="Defenders66" /> Brunnhilde's mental essence trapped in Norris's transformed body, fought Norris’ mental essence trapped in Brunnhilde's real body.<ref name="Defenders67" /> At the end of that encounter, the Valkyrie's body, still possessed by Norris’ mind, was consigned to Niffleheim, the realm inhabited by the spirits of the non-heroic Asgardian dead, while Brunnhilde's mind in Norris’ transformed body accompanied the Defenders, who had made the other dimensional journey with her, back to Earth.<ref name="Defenders68" />

For reasons yet unknown, Brunnhilde was not concerned at this time about reuniting her mind with her true body. It was not until Barbara Norris’ body was murdered that the Valkyrie's spirit and mind were inadvertently freed from their mortal host.<ref name="Defenders107" /> With the help of [[Doctor Strange]]'s magic, Brunnhilde regained her true body, which was rescued from [[Asgard (comics)|Niffleheim]] by the Enchantress. Back in her real body, Brunnhilde regained her full memory and normal warrior personality as well. Brunnhilde then battled Amora and banished her to the crystal of souls.  Feeling estranged from Asgard in general and Odin in particular for their neglect of her centuries-long plight, Brunnhilde chose to return to Earth with the Defenders.<ref name="Defenders109" />

[[File:ValkyrieDefenders66.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Cover of ''The Defenders'' #66 (Dec. 1978) by [[John Buscema]] and [[Bob McLeod (comics)|Bob McLeod]]]]

Odin placed the dangerously powerful self-styled goddess [[Moondragon]] into Brunnhilde's charge.<ref>{{cite comic |writer=DeMatteis, J. M. |penciller=Perlin, Don |inker=[[Kim DeMulder|DeMulder, Kim]] |story=Of Elves and Androids! |title=Defenders |issue=#123 |date=September 1983}}</ref> Brunnhilde was to teach Moondragon humility, and Moondragon served alongside Brunnhilde in the Defenders. Brunnhilde was to take action against Moondragon should she again become a menace. Eventually Moondragon reformed, but later she fell once again under the malevolent influence of the alien entity called the [[Dragon of the Moon]]. Moondragon attacked the Defenders, but Brunnhilde, given temporary additional powers by Odin for this occasion, including the power to grow to gigantic stature, opposed her. Brunnhilde summoned other Valkyries to her aid and together with two other Defenders, the [[Archangel (comics)|Angel]] and Cloud, they defeated Moondragon but failed to capture her.<ref>{{cite comic |writer=[[Peter B. Gillis|Gillis, Peter B.]] |penciller=Perlin, Don |inker=DeMulder, Kim |story=Dragon Midnight |title=Defenders |issue=#144 |date=June 1985}}</ref>

Months later Moondragon returned to attack the Defenders. During this encounter, her power was vastly augmented by the alien [[Beyonder]]. In order to defeat the Dragon, Brunnhilde and the Eternal called [[Interloper (comics)|Interloper]] projected their immortal life forces against it. They were joined by Defenders member [[Andromeda (Marvel Comics)|Andromeda]] and the Defenders' former foe [[Manslaughter (comics)|Manslaughter]], for it was necessary that Brunnhilde's and Interloper's life forces pass through "mortal instruments" in order that Moondragon be defeated as well. Joining hands, the four allies hurled the tremendous power of their combined life forces at the Dragon, Moondragon, and the [[Gargoyle (comics)|Gargoyle]] II, whose body was now under the Dragon's control. Three other Defenders went to rescue endangered innocents, and when they returned, Brunnhilde, Interloper, Andromeda, Manslaughter, Moondragon, and Gargoyle had all seemingly been transformed into statues of ashes and dust, and the Dragon of the Moon was apparently gone.<ref name="Defenders152" />

Brunnhilde was restored to life by Doctor Strange, now in the host body of a woman known as '''Sian Bowen'''. The other Defenders, Interloper, Andromeda, and Manslaughter were restored to life as well and they formed the [[Defenders (comics)|Dragon Circle]] to battle the Dragon of the Moon. After the Dragon of the Moon was defeated, Brunnhilde returned to Asgard.<ref name="DrStrange3" /><ref name="DrStrange4" /> Brunnhilde was killed in battle just before [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]]'s destruction of Asgard.<ref>{{cite comic |writer=[[Michael Avon Oeming|Oeming, Michael Avon]] |penciller=[[Andrea Di Vito|Di Vito, Andrea]] |inker=Di Vito, Andrea |story=Ragnarok Part the Third |title=Thor |volume=2 |issue=#82 |date=September 2004}}</ref>

After the 2011 storyline "[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]", Brunhilde seemingly defects from the Secret Avengers, embarking in a mission to steal and recover for herself the hammers used by the "Worthy", Cul's servants. She later reveals to have stopped consuming the Apples of Idunn, thus lessening her stamina and resilience and reverting to a mortal form, and as a Valkyrior she is able to seal within herself the hammers.

==Powers and abilities==
Valkyrie is the strongest of all Valkyrior. Like all her people, her body is several times denser than that of humans. She is not immortal, but she ages far more slowly than humans. Valkyrie is immune to all earthly diseases and is difficult to injure. Her Asgardian physiology grants her enhanced levels of stamina. Valkyrie can perceive the approach of death, in the form of a "deathglow" surrounding a person's body. She does not know how death will come but she can tell that it is imminent. Valkyrie can transport herself and a dying or dead body to and from the realm of the dead by willing it. Valkyrie has had extensive training in sword fighting as well as unarmed combat and horseback riding. Her natural fighting ability is among the best of all Asgardians, matched only by [[Sif (comics)|Sif]].

===Weapons and equipment===
Valkyrie carries two weapons of choice.

* An enchanted sword named Dragonfang. A wizard named Kahji-Da was said to have carved the sword from a tooth of an extra-dimensional dragon. The sword eventually passed into the possession of the [[Ancient One]], who in turn gave it to his disciple [[Doctor Strange]].  Strange went on to return it to the Valkyrie after she had bequeathed the virtually indestructible [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]]'s [[Ebony Blade]] to its rightful owner.
* An unnamed iron spear.

Valkyrie rides a winged horse named [[Aragorn (comics)|Aragorn]]. Aragorn was given to her by the current [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]].<ref>{{cite comic |writer=Englehart, Steve |penciller=Buscema, Sal |inker=[[Frank Bolle|Bolle, Frank]] |story=A Dark and Stormy Knight |title=The Defenders |issue=11 |date=December 1973}}</ref>

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Marvel===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, Valkyrie is a 19-year-old girl named '''Barbara Norris''' who aspires to play the public role of superhero, despite, at first, having no actual powers or skills. She describes herself as a female [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], only without the hammer, strength, or weather-powers. When [[Hank Pym]] was dismissed from the Ultimates, he decided to join the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], a group of good hearted, but delusional, somewhat farcical individuals enamored with superheroes but without powers or exceptional abilities. This is how he met Barbara, who called herself "Thor-Girl", telling Pym during introductions that while she doesn't have any powers, she is extensively proficient in [[martial arts]].<ref>{{cite comic |writer=[[Mark Millar|Millar, Mark]] |penciller=[[Bryan Hitch|Hitch, Bryan]] |inker=[[Paul Neary|Neary, Paul]] |story=The Defenders |title=[[The Ultimates 2]] |issue=#6 |date=July 2005}}</ref> This turned out to be a lie to impress Pym; she later confesses to him that she barely made it to an Orange Belt in karate and it took her several tries to pass the test.

Valkyrie next appears in ''[[The Ultimates 3]]'' #1,<ref>{{cite comic |writer=[[Jeph Loeb|Loeb, Jeph]] |penciller=[[Joe Madureira|Madureira, Joe]] |inker=Madureira, Joe |story=Sex, Lies, & DVD |title=The Ultimates 3 |issue=1 |date=February 2008}}</ref> now apparently super-powered, riding a black [[Pegasus]] and wielding a large, supposedly mystical sword that she uses to cleave [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] nearly in two, but seems to have no idea where these powers or weapons came from. At that point, she has been in a romantic live-in relationship with Thor for weeks and despite cultural differences, they are very close and allude to being in love. Since her last appearance, she appears to have been granted super strength and limited invulnerability; other superhuman attributes and abilities remain unknown. She speaks with a distinct [[valleyspeak|valley girl accent]], and while she does not seem to be the most intelligent of her teammates, she makes up for it with her loyalty, especially to Thor, and her big heart, along with being very powerful. At several points, she makes references to having lived a quiet, normal human life before becoming superhuman. She suggests she is more akin to Thor than it may seem, possibly meaning they may have some sort of shared Asgardian heritage. Her deepest fear is returning to the powerless, poor, and somewhat comically ordinary existence she had before. When confronted with this fear by the illusion-casting [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)#Ultimate Mastermind|Mastermind]], just before her two captors decide to assault her sexually, she is broken free of the illusion by a shadowy figure who claims to be the source of her new powers; she then retaliates by killing Mastermind and [[dismemberment|dismembering]] his partner [[Pyro (Marvel Comics)|Pyro]], taking both his hands off at the wrists with her sword.<ref>{{cite comic |writer=Loeb, Jeph |penciller=Madureira, Joe |inker=Madureira, Joe |title=The Ultimates 3 |issue=#5 |date=November 2008}}</ref>

During the 2009 "[[Ultimatum (comics)|Ultimatum]]" storyline it is revealed that Valkyrie was killed and transported to Valhalla, the Asgardian afterlife for fallen warriors run by [[Hela (comics)|Hela]], an Asgardian goddess, who is presented as above most other Asgardian gods in power and station. Thor learns of this and transports himself to Hela's dimension, demanding he let Valkyrie live again. Hela, then states that if he is able to overcome the challenge presented to him, he may bring Valkyrie back to the land of the living. In the middle of the ensuing battle, Thor finds that [[Captain America]]'s soul is also there, having been killed in the real world as well. Thor and Capt. America win the challenge and Hela grants Thor's request, but with the catch that once a soul has entered Hela's realm, it cannot leave without being substituted, so Thor gives up his soul so that Valkyrie may live and Hela returns her to Earth, whole and unharmed (Capt. America is given a reprieve on his soul as well and is returned to the land of the living, but how this worked with the "Soul Quota" stipulation is not addressed), while Thor's soul remains in the afterlife. Valkyrie, enraged and heart broken at the loss and sacrifice of her love, joins the battle once more and attacks [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] while trying to receive Thor's hammer and severs his arm. Magneto then uses his powers to slit her throat. She is then briefly shown, still alive, until Magneto collapses the ceiling on her.<ref>{{cite comic |writer=Loeb, Jeph |penciller=[[David Finch (comics)|Finch, David]] |inker=[[Danny Miki|Miki, Danny]] |story=Chapter Four: "A Time to Die" |title=[[Ultimatum (Ultimate Marvel)|Ultimatum]] |issue=#4 |date=May 2009}}</ref> Her fate is unknown until [[Ultimate Comics: New Ultimates|New Ultimates]] where it is revealed she now wields Thor's hammer. She loses it in battle with the Defenders who now have superpowers due to Loki's intervention. She is killed in the battle which allows Thor to resurrect and face Loki. During the battle, Loki is suddenly killed by a spear thrown by Valkyrie. Although apparently alive again, she reveals that she is now a servant of [[Hela (comics)|Hela]] and departs with Loki's body but not before asking Thor to defend the Earth to which she once belonged.<ref>{{cite comic |writer=Loeb, Jeph |penciller=[[Frank Cho|Cho, Frank]] |inker=Cho, Frank |story=Thor Reborn Chapter Five: Love |title=[[Ultimate Comics: New Ultimates]] |issue=#5 |date=April 2011}}</ref>
