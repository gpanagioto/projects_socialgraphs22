===Captain Carter===
As a result of the success of the new [[Peggy Carter (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Captain Carter]] from the ''[[What If...? (TV series)|What If...?]]'' animated series, Marvel introduced a similar character in the comic ''Captain Carter'' #1. It is set in its own universe, unrelated to the main Marvel universe or the MCU one. Captain Carter is cryogenically frozen from WWII up to the modern day, as in the usual origin story of Captain America, and discovers that HYDRA is still active.<ref>''Captain Carter'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Another Captain Carter, similar to the MCU character as well, appeared in ''Avengers Forever'' #4, a crossover involving the multiverse and many alternate versions of characters.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cbr.com/avengers-what-if-captain-carter-leader/|title= Marvel Makes a What If...

Marvel Comics.</ref>

She was adapted into the third series of the comic ''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]''.<ref name="ew.com">{{cite magazine |last1=Holub |first1=Christian |title=Peggy Carter is Captain America in new Marvel comic |url=https://ew.com/books/2018/04/19/peggy-carter-is-captain-america-new-marvel-comic/ |magazine=Entertainment Weekly |access-date=6 May 2019 |date=19 April 2018}}</ref>

===Exiles===
In [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|''Exiles'' Vol. 3]], the team is later joined by Peggy Carter (designed after [[Hayley Atwell]]) as the '''Captain America''' of her universe, accompanied by a [[Rikki Barnes|female version]] of [[Bucky Barnes]] known as Becky Barnes.<ref name="ew.com"/><ref>''Exiles'' (2018) #8-12</ref><ref>''Future Foundation'' (2019) #3</ref>

===House of M===
In the alternate reality created by Scarlet Witch in the 2005 "[[House of M]]" storyline, Captain America is never frozen in the Arctic, and instead marries Peggy shortly after World War II ends.<ref name="CAv5no10">''[[Captain America (comic book)|Captain America]]'' vol. 5 #10 (Oct. 2005). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Spider-Gwen===
On [[Spider-Gwen|Earth-65]], Peggy Carter (designed after [[Hayley Atwell]]) is the long-lived director of S.H.I.E.L.D., much like Nick Fury in the primary universe. She also sports an eye patch similar to the one worn by Fury,<ref>''Spider-Gwen'' #2</ref> later recruiting an amnesiac [[Manji (Blade of the Immortal)|Manji, the Immortal Mr. Murderhands]] to work for her as an assassin.<ref>''Spider-Gwen'' Vol 2. #20</ref>
