 Okay, where to next? Let's go see the stingrays, and then we can go to the sea lion show. What? I don't believe it. Why don't you just tell the people here at the sea park? It's true. The whale talked to all of us. In between shows at his orca tank. All right. In order to make our plan work, we're going to need the pool from Clyde's back yard, Timmy's wheelchair, the Russian government, and all of our skateboards. Craig, Token, get the slings ready.  What happened? They were going to do it for that 'N Sync guy. Uh, excuse me, we're looking for the Mexican...  Aeronautica y Spacia Administra-tio-n? Thanks.  Is this the Mexican space program?  Does the Mexican space programs have rockets that can go to the moon? This rocket will fly to the moon? To the moon?  We want to take something to the moon. How much would that cost? Two hundred? Million?  Quick, call Kyle. They're on their way, Manuel. Is the rocket gonna be ready?  Back down the ramp! It's all rigged to go! Kyle, it's all set to go!  Okay, Manuel, hit it.  Thanks for the ride, Manuel. I wonder... if he'll ever come back and visit us.
