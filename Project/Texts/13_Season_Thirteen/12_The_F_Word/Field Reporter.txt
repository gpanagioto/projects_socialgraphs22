And what is your name, little boy? Alright Martin, can you do me a favor? Could you point to the "fag" for me?   How do you fags feel about the new city ordinance? Just asking you if you feel okay or displeased about the ordinance, fag. I already did it twice. I bet I do. Fag.  Excitement is in the air as the citizens of South Park amass to see if the word "fag" will officially be changed in the English dictionary. Four local boys will state their case to the head dictionary editor, and if they succeed, "fag" will officially refer to Harley riders nationwide. And Tom, it looks as though the dictionary officials have arrived.
