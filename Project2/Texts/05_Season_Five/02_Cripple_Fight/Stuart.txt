Well, now, that's part of the fun. You boys just make sure to obey the scout leader now. He's the man in charge. Look! I'm not saying the new scout leader's a bad person, I just don't think he should be a scout leader! He's really, really gay. I have nothing against homosexuals either, Randy, but the big camping trip is next week! Are you sayin' you're fine with this guy campin' overnight, alone, with our boys?? Uh, Kenny, it's nine o'clock. Uh huh! Your wife, huh? Yeah. Now they're acting like men. I heard that. Kenny?
