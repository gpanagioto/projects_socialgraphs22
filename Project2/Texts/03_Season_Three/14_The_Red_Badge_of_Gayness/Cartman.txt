Hey, dude. Do you like to rock?!  Yes, I like to rock! Helloo, Baltimore! I'm playing the drum. You can't just "hit" a drum, you have to beat the shit out of it!  That's how you ''rock'', dude. I am keepin' the beat; your flute-playing sucks! Ey, I'll get it! Yes I will! Go!!! Does Cleveland like to rock?! Go!!! Yes, damn it! What? No way! Flutes are totally gay! Oh! Well, you know what I say?!  Later.  Good morning, gentlemen. Yes. This year, I've decided to fight for the glorious South. Screw you guys, home. And may I say that we're going to whup your ass this time. Oh, really? I'm pretty sure I just did. Nuh uhn, the South is gonna win. Yes we are! Well, this war is about slavery, so how about if the South wins, you two assholes have to be my slaves for a month. Right. Then I shall bid you good morning, gentlemen, and see you on the battlefield.  Yippie! Long live the Confederacy!  Hooray for the South! But why? Why should they get the bell? But we don't ''have'' to lose.  God bless those men that fight for their freedom. God bless those men! And God bless the Confederasah!  So, you guys about ready to start being my slaves yet?   Perhaps we should ''take'' Topeka. They mock us in Kansas, soldier. They think the South is a joke. They don't respect our authoritah. No. I say we take Topeka.  I'll bet you can't.  I'll bet you can't, because you guys are all pussies!  Oh! What was our bet again? Let's see... Yes, I remember. If the South wins you have to be ''my'' slaves for a month. Yes. E-e-enjoy your freedom, gentlemen. Soon, you will be my properteh. Come, Kenny. Come fight for us, and I'll make sure you get lots of plunder and womens.  Excuse meh.  Where did the Confederates go, son? Ah, splendid. Then to Fort Sumter we shall go.  Yeah. Can I get some of those animal cookies? Those frosty ones with the sprinkles on 'em.  Where are you going? We can't go home, we have to take Fort Sumter!   No! What about the Confederasuh?! What about freedom?! God, I hate you guys! This isn't over! Oh no! Oh no, not by a long shot!  Uh uh come uh, come on, guys. Just one little drink. Uh a toast to how far you came and all that you saw.  Gentlemen! I hate to break up the party, but I believe we have a fort to take. Yes! Yes! Take the fort! Suck my ass! We asked the State of South Carlina for recruits. The reinforcements are bound to show up. I knew they would! Now our numbers are truly great. It is time. It is time to march to Washington D.C.! I don't. I made it up.  What the hell are you guys doing?! What?! No! We still have to fight! NOOO!! WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-  -AAAH! Dammit! Dammit, I was so close! Dammit! Wait a minute! I don't have to be your slave. The North still won the Civil War! That means slavery is abolished! Hahahaha haa ha!
