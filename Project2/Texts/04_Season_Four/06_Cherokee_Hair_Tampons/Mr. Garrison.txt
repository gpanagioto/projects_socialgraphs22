What?? Well, who cares about a guy that makes beer?! Jesus Christ, I'm trying to teach history!  Oh, whatever! That was not me, that was Mr. Hat!   Gentlemen, teaching is all I know. It is the air that I breathe.  Oh, sorry. So I can keep it then?'' [grabs back his revolver]''  I don't know what I'm goin' tuh do, Mackey. Teaching is all I know. I've always wanted to write a novel. But I never know what to write about. Besides teaching? ...Poontang. I can't help it. I'm a womanizer sometimes, I know, but I just think that... taking a woman home and getting some hot poon is about the greatest thing in the world. Yes, that's it.  I am going to write the Great American Romance Novel! Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, did you read the book? Well, what did you think? Ooohhh, why not? Well, I'm sure there's lots of naughty words. It is a romance novel. No? What the hell are you talkin' about?! Well, I thought it was mostly women that read these things! Well, women want to read about ding-dongs! D'you think women care about the details of female anatomy?! Hell no! Women wanna read about big, powerful schlongs!  Look, I've seen women read these things. They skim along and skim along until they get to the part about the penis! That's what they want, so that's what I'm giving them!  Boys, I have an announcement to make: I'm not gonna be your teacher anymore. I've become a best-selling author! And Kyle, I want you to have a signed copy as a get-well present.
