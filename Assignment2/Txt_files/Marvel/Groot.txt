'''Groot''' ({{IPAc-en|g|r|uː|t}}) is a [[fiction]]al [[Character (arts)|character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by [[Stan Lee]], [[Larry Lieber]] and [[Jack Kirby]], the character first appeared in ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'' #13 (Nov. 1960). An [[extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial]], sentient [[tree]]-like creature, the original Groot first appeared as an [[alien invasion|invader]] that intended to capture humans for experimentation. The character can only say the repeated line "''I am Groot''", but has different meaning. In the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]] and [[Rocket Raccoon (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Rocket Raccoon]] are able to understand him.

The character was reintroduced as a heroic, noble being in 2006, and appeared in the [[fictional crossover|crossover]] comic book storyline "[[Annihilation: Conquest]]". Groot went on to star in its [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series, ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy]]'', joining the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|team of the same name]].

Groot has been featured in a variety of associated Marvel merchandise, including [[animation|animated]] [[television series]], [[toy]]s and [[trading card]]s. [[Vin Diesel]] voices [[Groot (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Groot]] (with Krystian Godlewski playing the character via [[performance capture]]) in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) film ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' (2014), cameoing as Groot's son (also named Groot) in the film's ending (with [[James Gunn]] playing the character via performance capture for [[dancing]]), colloquially known as "Baby Groot", before reprising the role in the MCU films ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]]'' (2017), ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018), ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019), and ''[[Thor: Love and Thunder]]'' (2022). Baby Groot returns for the [[Disney+]] short form show ''[[I Am Groot]]''. [[Fred Tatasciore]] voices Groot on the [[Disney California Adventure]] ride [[Guardians of the Galaxy – Mission: Breakout!|Guardians of the Galaxy: Mission Breakout]]. Diesel will return to voice the second Groot in ''[[The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special]]'' (2022) and ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3]]'' (2023). Diesel also voiced Groot as a cameo in the 2018 Disney animated film ''[[Ralph Breaks the Internet]]''.

Since his film premiere and animated series debut, Groot has become a [[pop culture]] icon, with his repeated line "I am Groot" becoming an [[Internet meme]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.dailydot.com/geek/i-am-groot-and-other-limited-vocabulary-characters/|title= Like 'Hodor,' 'I Am Groot' is already becoming a loved Internet meme|first= Mike|last= Fenn|date= August 5, 2014|work= [[The Daily Dot]]|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150819055317/http://www.dailydot.com/geek/i-am-groot-and-other-limited-vocabulary-characters/|archive-date= August 19, 2015|url-status= live}}</ref>

==Publication history==
[[File:Gotg 2.jpg|thumb|Groot's first appearance in ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'' #13 ]]
Groot first appeared in ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'' #13 (Nov. 1960), and was created by [[Stan Lee]], [[Larry Lieber]] and [[Jack Kirby]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/groottta.htm|title= Groot|first= Jeff|last= Christiansen|date= March 10, 2011|publisher= Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131113231254/http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/groottta.htm|archive-date= November 13, 2013|url-status= live}}</ref> He appeared again in ''[[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|The Incredible Hulk vol. 2 Annual]]'' #5 (Oct. 1976), alongside five other monsters from Marvel's anthology horror comics of the late 1950s and early 1960s. In ''[[The Sensational Spider-Man]]'' #−1 (July 1997), Groot was featured in a nightmare of the young [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]].

Groot reappeared in 2006 in the six-issue limited series ''[[Nick Fury's Howling Commandos]]'', and appeared in the ''[[Annihilation: Conquest]]'' and ''Annihilation: Conquest&nbsp;– [[Star-Lord]]'' limited series. Groot went on to join the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] in the series of the same name, and remained a fixture of the title until its cancellation with issue #25 in 2010. Groot appeared in its follow-up, the limited series ''[[The Thanos Imperative]]'', and, alongside fellow Guardian [[Rocket Raccoon]], Groot starred in backup features in ''[[Annihilators (Marvel Comics)|Annihilators]]'' #1–4 (March–June 2011) and ''Annihilators: Earthfall'' #1–4 (Sept.–Dec. 2011).

Groot appeared in issues #6–8 of ''[[Avengers Assemble (comics)|Avengers Assemble]]'' as a member of the Guardians. Groot is one of the stars of ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' vol. 3, a part of the [[Marvel NOW!]] relaunch.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=41610|title= NYCC: Bendis, McNiven & Wacker Relaunch the ''Guardians of the Galaxy''|last= Richards|first= Dave|date= October 14, 2012 |publisher= [[Comic Book Resources]]|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131031122838/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=41610|archive-date= October 31, 2013|url-status= live|access-date =October 15, 2012}}</ref>

In March 2015, it was announced that Groot would be getting his very first solo series by writer [[Jeff Loveness]] and artist [[Brian Kesinger]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/comics-newcomers-declare-i-am-groot-with-new-marvel-spinoff-series|title= Comics Newcomers Declare 'I Am Groot' With New Marvel Spinoff Series|first= Kiel|last= Phegley|date= March 7, 2015|publisher= Comic Book Resources|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150905150237/http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/comics-newcomers-declare-i-am-groot-with-new-marvel-spinoff-series|archive-date= September 5, 2015|url-status= live}}</ref>

The Groot that debuted in ''Tales to Astonish'' and the one that was introduced in ''Annihilation: Conquest'' were [[Retroactive continuity|retroactively]] established as being separate members of the same species in the sixth and final issue of the ''Groot'' ongoing series that launched in June 2015.<ref name = "Groot6">{{Cite comic|writer= Loveness, Jeff|penciller= Kesinger, Brian|inker= Kesinger, Brian|title = Groot|issue= #6|date= January 2016}}</ref> With Infinity Wars in August 2018, however, Groot specifically references the fact that during his first visit to the planet Earth, he had promised to "march across the surface of the planet and doom all who dared to oppose Groot."<ref name = "GrootInfinity">{{Cite comic|writer= Duggan, Gerry|penciller= Deodato Jr., Mike|inker= Deodato Jr., Mike|title = Infinity Wars|issue= #1|date= August 2018}}</ref> This seemingly reverted the character's origins to having both eras of Groot referencing the same persona, therefore invalidating the retroactive change from issue six of the ''Groot'' series.

==Origins==
Groot is a ''[[Flora colossus]]'' from Planet X, the capital of the branch worlds. The ''Flora colossi'' are tree-like beings whose language is almost impossible to understand due to the stiffness of their [[larynx]]es, causing their speech to sound like they are repeating the phrase "I am Groot". Other beings try to be friendly but become angry with the ''Flora colossi'' for their apparent inability to  speak, though Groot was shown to have been actually speaking not just understandably but eloquently in his language  throughout ''Annihilation: Conquest''. The ''Flora colossi'' are ruled over by the "Arbor Masters" and teach the children of the species with "Photonic Knowledge", which is the collected knowledge of the Arbor Masters of the generations and is absorbed through [[photosynthesis]]; this is a highly advanced education method, making the ''Flora colossi'' geniuses.

The ''Flora colossus'' sapling that would come to be known as "Groot" came from an "Ennobled Sap-line" and was gifted with a tremendous grasp of quasi-dimensional super-positional engineering. Groot did not get along with fellow saplings but instead preferred the company of the "Maintenance Mammals", against which the other saplings discriminated. Groot was exiled by the "Arbor Masters" in ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #14<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.marvel.com/comics/75383/groot-hardwood-history/|title=I Am Groot: Hardwood History|website= Marvel.com|first= Steffi|last= Feldman|date= September 22, 2017|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190517093643/https://www.marvel.com/articles/comics/i-am-groot-hardwood-history|archive-date= May 17, 2019|url-status= live|df= mdy-all}}</ref> after killing another sapling to defend a maintenance mammal it was brutalizing.

An alternate origin was presented in the ''Groot'' ongoing series. In the story, it is revealed that the other ''Flora colossi'' had been abducting organisms from other planets, including a young human girl named Hannah. After seeing Hannah, Groot realized that what his people were doing was wrong, and managed to save the child and send her back to Earth. However, for his disobedience, Groot was exiled from Planet X and forced to wander the universe until he met [[Rocket Raccoon]] many decades later, where this version of Groot later became a member of the Guardians of the Galaxy.<ref name = "Groot6"/>

==Fictional character biography==
===Original Groot===
Groot is an [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|extraterrestrial]] tree monster who initially came to [[Earth]] seeking humans to capture and study. Groot was seemingly destroyed by termites used by Leslie Evans.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Stan Lee|Lee, Stan]]|penciller= [[Jack Kirby|Kirby, Jack]]|inker= [[Dick Ayers|Ayers, Dick]]|story= I Challenged...

Groot was later revealed to have survived, but was a captive of the [[Collector (comics)|Collector]] and held in his zoo in Canada until Groot and the other captive creatures were freed by the [[Mole Man]]. Groot and the other creatures rampaged in New York City until they were stopped by a band of superheroes, and were then dumped through a portal to the [[Negative Zone]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Steve Niles|Niles, Steve]]|penciller= [[Duncan Fegredo|Fegredo, Duncan]]|inker= Fegredo, Duncan|story= Good Monsters|title= Marvel Monsters: Monsters on the Prowl|issue= #1|date= December 2005}}</ref>

Groot was later tracked down and captured by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'s Paranormal Containment Unit, nicknamed the [[Nick Fury's Howling Commandos|Howling Commandos]], when his tree scent was detected by [[Sasquatch (comics)#Howling Commandos|Sasquatch]] and [[Abominable Snowman (comics)|Abominable Snowman]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Keith Giffen|Giffen, Keith]]|penciller= Francisco, Eduardo|inker= Campanella, Robert|story= Creature Feature|title= [[Nick Fury's Howling Commandos]]|issue= #2|date= January 2006}}</ref> While Groot was being held captive, [[Gorilla-Man#Ken Hale|Gorilla-Man]] talked to Groot about joining the Howling Commandos.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Giffen, Keith|penciller= Aucoin, Derec|inker= Aucoin, Derec|story= Assault on Area 13|title= Nick Fury's Howling Commandos|issue= #4|date= March 2006}}</ref> When [[Merlin (Marvel Comics)|Merlin]] and his forces attacked the base, the Howling Commandos let Groot and their other captives free, who proceeded to stampede on Merlin's army; Groot was the only one to turn back, offering to join the Howling Commandos.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Giffen, Keith|penciller= Donovan, Derec|inker= Donovan, Derec|story= Destroy All Monsters!|title= Nick Fury's Howling Commandos|issue= #5|date= April 2006}}</ref> Groot aided the Howling Commandos as they assaulted Merlin's forces.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Giffen, Keith|penciller= [[Mike Norton|Norton, Mike]]|inker= Aucoin, Derec; Lee, Norman|story= I thought you said this was a precision science|title= Nick Fury's Howling Commandos|issue= #6|date= May 2006}}</ref>

===Guardians of the Galaxy's Groot===

A different Groot played a part in ''[[Annihilation: Conquest]]'', at which time it was shown Groot may be the last remaining member of the ''Flora colossi'', and was under arrest by the Kree for an unknown reason. Groot earned freedom by joining [[Star-Lord]]'s strike force, where Groot and [[Rocket Raccoon]] formed a bond, Rocket being one of the few beings with the ability to understand Groot's language.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Giffen, Keith|penciller= [[Timothy Green II|Green II, Timothy]]|inker= Olazaba, Victor|story= Starlord Part 1|title= [[Annihilation: Conquest]] - [[Star-Lord|Starlord]]|issue= #1|date= September 2007}}</ref> Star-Lord's team fought their way through the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]], but after the death of [[Deathcry]] the team decided to escape through a drainage pipe that Groot could not fit into.

Groot can absorb wood as food, and has the ability to [[Regeneration (biology)|regenerate]].<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://www.marvel.com/characters/groot/on-screen|title= Groot On Screen Powers, Villains, History|website= Marvel Entertainment|date= 2019|archive-url= https://archive.today/20191130010040/https://www.marvel.com/characters/groot/on-screen|archive-date= November 30, 2019|url-status= live|df= mdy-all|access-date= February 21, 2019}}</ref> Groot can control trees and plants, using them to attack others, and appears to be resistant to fire. Groot is able to sprout dramatically increasing mass which then severely inhibits movement.{{issue|date=September 2014}}

Groot has been seemingly killed on multiple occasions, each time regrowing from a sprig.{{issue|date=September 2014}}

=="I am Groot"==
[[Black Bolt]]'s brother [[Maximus (comics)|Maximus the Mad]] asserted that whenever Groot is saying the trademark "I am Groot!" he has actually been saying a number of things, and his varying inflections of the sentence are the equivalent of words and sentences. People who have interacted with Groot are gradually able to decipher the meaning of the inflections and can carry on full conversations with Groot as time goes on. The mature form of Groot's species is robust and heavyweight, which causes the organs of acoustic generation to become stiff and inflexible. It is this nature of Groot's larynx that causes people, who are oblivious to the subtle nuances of ''Flora colossi'' speech, to misinterpret Groot as merely repeating his name. It could not be determined whether Maximus's claim was true or merely another manifestation of his madness, though Groot did genuinely seem to be assisting Maximus with highly advanced engineering.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Abnett, Dan; Lanning, Andy|penciller= Walker, Brad|inker= Olazaba, Victor; Hanna, Scott|story= Adam Magus|title= Guardians of the Galaxy|volume= 2|issue= #17|date= October 2009}}</ref> Later, in ''All-New X-Men'' #23, [[Jean Grey]] telepathically links with Groot, showing that Groot's thought processes are indeed complex, and the declaration of "I am Groot!" usually represents attempts at highly intelligent communication.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Bendis, Brian Michael|penciller= [[Stuart Immonen|Immonen, Stuart]]|inker= [[Wade Von Grawbadger|Von Grawbadger, Wade]]|story= The Trial of Jean Grey Part 3 of 5|title= [[All-New X-Men]]|issue= #23|date= April 2014}}</ref>

In ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'', which takes place in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]] explains that ''Flora colossi'' is offered as an [[Course (education)#Elective|elective]] in Asgardian schools.  Filmmaker James Gunn has interpreted this as a joke on the part of the character of Thor.<ref>{{Cite web|title= The Truth Behind Thor Being Able to Speak Groot Revealed by James Gunn |website=Movieweb |url= https://movieweb.com/thor-groot-language-avengers-infinity-war/| date=27 April 2020|access-date=25 September 2021}}</ref>
