Crime scene investigation!   Is that the toilet paper there? I'll need to take those bags as evidence. You?! So where were you last night at around 9?! Aha!! Got you! Insurance?  Now you listen to me! Whoever TP'ed your house is still out there roaming the streets. It's only a matter of time before another house and another family is victimized! I have to stop that from happening. No I do not. I just need to talk to someone who knows how toilet paperers think. Hello, Josh. My name is Officer Barbrady. I'm with the South Park police. I was hoping you could help me solve a toilet-papering case? Uh please, I need your help. What would you want in return? You... know I can't give you toilet paper, Josh.  Well, that's kind of personal. Look kid, I have very little time to catch whoever toilet-papered that house. Tell me what you know. So you think there was more than one. Why? Oh all right, all right, my uncle Charles used to hit me with a belt!  Yes, thanks for coming, Mr. Bell. A house was TP'ed in South Park and I need to see if you can identify the toilet paper I recovered from the scene.  Is this toilet paper from your store?  Mr. Bell, do you remember anyone suspicious buying toilet paper in the last few days? Well, like someone who was black or Mexican or Middle Eastern. Josh, I need your help. How do you mean? Yes. No, two-ply.  What? What does that tell you? To get revenge. What do you mean? I don't have time for this, kid. Alright alright my dad dressed me up like a little girl on poker nights and he made me sit on all my uncles' laps!  Oh. Of course! One of her students! Hello boys. How are you? It sure is! Right over here.  Why do you say that? All right, boys, visiting time is over. Thanks for stopping by. Huh?? Well, looks like I made a mistake. I... guess I'd better let you out now.  Excuse me, everyone.  Uh, Policeman Brown, will you take Josh outside, please? Well, I guess my work here is done. After all this, I'm gonna need a long vacation.  Okay, Josh, time to go back to the...  Oh no! Couldn't you have gone after him? Police station. Josh? Josh, where are you?! Josh, you have to go back to Juvenile Hall. You only have a three-week sentence.
