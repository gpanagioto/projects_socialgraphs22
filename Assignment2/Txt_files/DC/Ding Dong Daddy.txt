==Fictional character biography==
The President's Commission on Education asked the [[Teen Titans]] to help deal with the problem of high school dropouts. In the town of Harrison, the young heroes discovered dropouts being hired by Ding-Dong Daddy Dowd, proprietor of a custom [[hot rod]] and bike shop. Uncovering evidence that Dowd's operation was a front for criminals, the Titans went undercover as would-be high school drop-outs and exposed his schemes, and persuaded his teenage employees to return to school. This was a morality issue to stay in school.<ref>''Teen Titans'' #3. DC Comics.</ref>

==In other media==
Ding Dong Daddy appears in the [[Teen Titans (season 5)|fifth season]] of the animated series ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'', voiced by [[David Johansen]]. He appears as one of dozens of villains recruited by the [[Brotherhood of Evil]] to fight the Titans and their allies throughout the world. He later steals a locked briefcase containing [[Dick Grayson|Robin's]] most prized possession and offers to return it if the Titans can beat him in a road race. He drives a customized [[hot rod]] equipped with an arsenal of weapons and devices to foil pursuers and is accompanied by a pit crew of [[gremlin]]s in a rolling full-service repair shop that can fix damage to his vehicle and sabotage those of his competitors. Several other villains learn of the race and join in, but Red X surprises everyone by disabling their vehicles so Robin can win. Robin opens the briefcase to show its contents to the other Titans, but [[MacGuffin|the camera angle prevents the viewer from seeing what is inside]]. Ding Dong Daddy appears in "Titans Together", joining in the final all-out battle against the Titans in the Brotherhood's Paris hideout. [[Kole]] and [[Gnarrk]] destroy his car and is subsequently flash-frozen alongside all the other villains.
