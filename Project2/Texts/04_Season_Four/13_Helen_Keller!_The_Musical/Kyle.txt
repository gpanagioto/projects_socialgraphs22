I am sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Keller, but I'm afraid your daughter Helen still cannot see, hear, or speak. Can we take a lunch break now? What is it, Butters? We ''can't'' be outdone by the kindergartners! Revamp how? The rules are that the fourth grade class ''has'' to perform the Helen Keller Story. Okay! A smart one, that can do tricks. Uh, Timmy, if we back to the other kids with that turkey they're gonna be pissed! What?! Aw, dude, don't say that! Alright, we'll take him. How much? But you were just gonna take it out in the backyard and put a bullet in its head!  Aw, blow it out your ass! It's a turkey.  His name is Gobbles. Um, we... sssort of spend all the money on this... one... I didn't do ''anything'' to you. Timmy saw the turkey and wanted to get it. What do you want me to say to him?  Look, I know it isn't exactly what we wanted, but maybe we can train it. Timmy, we already ''got'' a turkey. Dude, don't forget: Timmy is the only kid who can play Helen Keller. Don't piss him off. What Butters?  So wait. Do we do that spin-around thing on the last beat? You ready for the big show, Timmy? Cartman, where's Timmy's turkey? He's gone, dude! Butters says he saw him leave.  Dude, it just can't be better than ours. It ''just can't be.'' Butters told us their play was awesome!
