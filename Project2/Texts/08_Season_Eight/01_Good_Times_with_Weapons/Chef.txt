Hello there, children! How's it goin'? Why bad? No, can't say that I have. Hey, what are you children doin' with those weapons? Well, you children should be careful with those. You could put somebody's eye out. Well, I've gotta get to the fairgrounds. They're about to start the big auction. So long, children!
