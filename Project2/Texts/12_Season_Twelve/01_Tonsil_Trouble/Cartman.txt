AHHHHHH. What? No- No way. I'm not going to the hospital, Mom! No, I'm not scared... I just- I don't want my tonsils out, that's all! ...Ice cream? Well...you did say ''free'' ice cream?   Uh. It's over?  Its over! I didn't feel anything! You were right, Mom! All right, so where's my ice cream? You were right, doctor! Everything is okay! What's that supposed to mean?! I HAVE AIDS? "''Sorry''"?! You gave me AIDS and you're "''sorry''"?! Mom, you said nothing would go wrong! No! No, this is a joke, right!? This is a joke; I can't have AIDS!  Fuck your ice cream! You said I'd be fine! You all said I'd be FINE! NO! ''NOOOOOOOO''! God damn it, this sucks ass! Is Kyle laughing out there!? This isn't a time for funny jokes, I'm gonna die! Not a big deal!? Is that how everyone feels!? People need to understand the seriousness of this illness, and the bravery of the people who struggle with it! Where the hell is everybody?  So this is it? Well that's just great! Of all the times to get AIDS, I get it right when everyone stops givin' a crap! Just bring out Elton John already! Jimmy Buffett?! Nobody likes Jimmy Buffett except for frat boys and alcoholic chicks from the South!  Fuck you, Jimmy Buffett! You fuckin' suck! Fuck you Mom, I have fucking AIDS! Hey guys, thanks a lot for comin' to my AIDS benefit yesterday. Yeah, you forgot. Just like a lot of people lately have forgot that AIDS is still killing people! Seems like all of America has forgot that HIV is a serious disease. ...No, as a matter of fact, Jimmy Buffett came instead.  OH YEAH, it'S REAL FUCKIN' FUNNY, KYLE! NO YOU DON'T! If you really felt bad, you'd wipe that fucking smirk off your face!  Well any goddamned second, Kyle!  Jesus Christ, can you believe that asshole?! Ironic how?  Oh, and what?! I deserve it?! Is that what you think?!  Nobody deserves this illness, Stan, Kenny! Nobody! It's awful! And maybe somebody needs to teach Kyle how to have some compassion!  Kyle thinks that HIV is funny, so we're gonna make him look funny, and then he'll know how it feels to be laughed at. Butters, helping people who have AIDS is one of the most important things you can do. I'm not just sure, Butters. I'm HIV-positive.  All right, now get the rope up over that third rafter above the window; that's the easiest access. Yeah, I've sneaked into Kyle's room lots of times.  Pass me the ball!  Kyle, what the F?! Kyle, what?! Oh, you have HIV, huh Kyle? Guess it isn't so funny now, is it? Nothing! Oh nice, Butters, you big tattle-tale.  Well, Kyle, maybe I was just trying to prove a p- Kyle! Well he was being a total dick! And he's a big tattle-tale and going around and talking crap about me!  Kind of.  I'm sorry. I'm sorry for giving you AIDS, Kyle. See? He's tattling again. He hasn't learned a thing you guys.   Kyle, where are you going? What's that supposed to mean? Kyle?  Kyle, no! I apologized, Kyle!! Kyle! Kyle, hold on, you asshole!  I'm sorry I gave you HIV, all right?! Just give me a chance, and I can cure you! No, no, listen, Kyle! I'm on to something. There really is hope. Break my Xbox and you'll never know. NO! No-al-, all right Kyle! Magic Johnson, Kyle! The key is Magic Johnson. He was a basketball player. So he got HIV like fifty years ago, and he's still totally fine! Magic Johnson has some kind of resistance to the virus, Kyle. I've been researching it since I got infected. If we can track him down and isolate his genetic prototype, we have a chance of beating this thing, buddy.  You and me, Kyle. We can overcome our illness; I swear it to you!  My God... We need two tickets to Los Angeles as soon as possible. Ah, sir, you don't understand. We have to see Magic Johnson right away. You see, we have AIDS. Don't you get it?! We are two pals afflicted with an illness, and who only have each other in a race against time! Innocent playful children who are stricken with a deadly disease for no reason! We're not just sure, we're HIV-positive. Forget it, all right?! We'll use another airline! One that cares!  Oh uh, you know, all over cancer. Yeah, well, at least  it's not as bad as having AIDS. AIDS is the worst disease. No you wouldn't! Look, shouldn't you be serving people drinks or something?! Get outta here!  Magic Johnson, here we come.  I know. I'm scared too. We're not just sure, we're HIV-positive. Kyle, we need to try to find a-  I don't think it's funny, Kyle.  Well excuse me, Kyle, for trying to keep some optimism, you know? I mean, sometimes when things... seem their darkest you just need to try and stay... HIV-positive, but if you wanna be so HIV-negative all the time, I-  Are you sure?  Aarrhh! Ow, fuck, Kyle! Yeah well, if there's a chance of being cured of this illness, then Kyle is willing to take that risk. All right!  What?! Aw, no! What?! Aw, God damn it!  Well I'll tell you this, Kyle. I'm never gettin' my tonsils out again, hahahaha. What? No. No.  Kyle, no!
