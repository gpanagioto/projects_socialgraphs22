Does that mean we only have to pay one sixteenth attention to you?  This is bullcrap! A guest speaker comes to our class and assigns us a report on Thanksgiving? Yeah, and now my video game time is getting screwed over by them. Jesus Kyle, you are really being crampy today. You guys, we are wasting time. If we have to write a report on Thanksgiving let's just go downstairs and watch TV.  The History Channel is probably playing Thanksgiving specials back to back. We can learn everything we need. Dude, see? I told you. Who needs to read a bunch of stupid books when we've got History Channel? Uh-huh?? Kyle, why are you being so grumpy? Are you on your period again? Okay, let's take a vote: Who thinks the possibility of ancient aliens at Thanksgiving makes for an interesting history report?  Okay, and who wants to take a little Pamprin so their menstrual cramps stop bringing everyone down? Kyle?  Did you guys know that when you stop menstruating it's called menopause? Yeah, God takes your period away, and apparently it makes you really irritable? I was thinking maybe that's why Kyle's been so grouchy lately, 'cause he's goin' through menopause. See what I mean, you guys?  Non! Mom, did you already get stuffing for Thanksgiving dinner? Tell me you've already got everything we need for Thanksgiving! Oh no. Oh NO! Clyde Donovan said that he saw on the news there's gonna be a massive stuffing shortage! Get your coat on, Mom! We've gotta go to the store!  You guys have stuffing?! Oh... We're not too late. Mother, come!  Hey! Where is it! No! NOOOO! Yeah, History Channel rules.  Ohhh??
