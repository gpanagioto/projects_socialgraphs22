Wendy breaks up. Wendy breaks up with you.  She just doesn't wanna be with you anymore. She said she still wants to be friends.  Fuck you, fatass! You guys are assholes! God, you're so stupid!  Stan, why don't you show her you love her? If you really want Wendy back, try doing the most romantic thing you can think of. If you really want a shot at getting her back, stand outside her window, hold a boombox over your head, and play  Peter Gabriel.
