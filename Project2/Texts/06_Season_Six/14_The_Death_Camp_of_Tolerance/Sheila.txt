Oh, hi boys. That's great. We're having our book of the month club meeting, so why don't you boys go outside and play? Kyle! You know better than to discriminate against homosexuals! That's right! I think it's time you kids took a little trip to the Museum of Tolerance!  Then it's settled. Boys, you're going to tolerance camp. Yes. You boys don't know how much we suffered.
