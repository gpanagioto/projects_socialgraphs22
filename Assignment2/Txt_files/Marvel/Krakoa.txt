'''Krakoa''' is a fictional living [[island]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. It first appeared in ''[[Giant-Size X-Men]]'' #1 and was created by [[Len Wein]] and [[Dave Cockrum]]. Initially depicted as an antagonist, Krakoa has since grown into a sentient habitat for the mutant nation that shares its name.<ref name="house1">''House of X'' #1 (July 2019)</ref>

==Publication history==

On its first appearance in ''Giant-Size X-Men'' no. 1 (1975), Krakoa is introduced as the Pacific island setting where a previous team of [[X-Men]] have gone missing while investigating strong readings from [[Cerebro]], a device with the ability to detect [[mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]]. Its name recalls that of [[Krakatoa]], a volcanic island in Indonesia which [[1883 eruption of Krakatoa|erupted in 1883]]. Prof. [[Charles Xavier]] recruits a new, international team to rescue them. On their arrival on Krakoa, they are attacked by the flora, fauna, and very ground of the island, until finally [[Angel (Marvel Comics)|Angel]]—one of the original X-Men they are rescuing—warns them that "the island itself" is the powerful mutant which Cerebro had detected. That is, the entire island of Krakoa had become a single monstrous mutant, similar to the [[Aspidochelone]] of legend. ([[Godzilla]] and [[Monsterland and Monster Island|Monster Island]] are also likely influences, since nuclear testing is blamed for Krakoa's creation.) It needs the mutants in order to leech their life-energy. Both teams escape as Krakoa is ripped from the ocean bed, hurled into space, and apparently dies. While the issue would be celebrated for revitalizing the X-Men, the character / setting of Krakoa was revived only very sporadically until [[Jonathan Hickman]]'s 2019 X-Men event ''[[House of X and Powers of X]]''. In those miniseries (which established the premise of the X-Men comics going forward), the mutants have established communication with Krakoa and agreed to live on it in a symbiotic relationship, establishing the island as an independent mutant nation-state. The true aims of Krakoa have so far been left ambiguous.

==Fictional character biography==
Krakoa was originally depicted as a very small island in the Pacific Ocean that was located close to where some nuclear bombing tests were done. The radiation somehow mutated the island's ecosystem into a hive-mind entity.<ref name="GSXM1">''[[Giant-Size X-Men]]'' #1 (1975). Marvel Comics.</ref> [[Nick Fury|Sergeant Fury]] and his [[Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos|commando team]] were accidental witnesses to the bomb drop which created Krakoa in early 1945, and soon afterwards crashed on and encountered the island's collective intelligence, with whom they arranged a peaceful parting in exchange for keeping its existence a secret.<ref>''Journey into Mystery: The Birth of Krakoa'' (2018). Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>[https://www.newsarama.com/40449-journey-into-mystery-returns-with-the-birth-of-krakoa.html George Marston: ''JOURNEY INTO MYSTERY Returns Original NICK FURY Investigating Deep X-MEN Lore'']. Newsarama, June 19, 2018.</ref>

However, Krakoa later became hungry for the unique life energy created by [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]]. It was responsible for the deaths of a team of young mutants, composed of [[Petra (comics)|Petra]], [[Sway (comics)|Sway]], [[Darwin (comics)|Darwin]] and [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Kid Vulcan]] (the latter two were able to survive, but became trapped inside Krakoa), from a parallel X-Men team led by [[Moira MacTaggert|Moira McTaggart]].<ref>''[[X-Men: Deadly Genesis]]'' (2005/2006). Marvel Comics.</ref> It was later able to capture the original [[X-Men]] (then consisting of [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]], [[Havok (comics)|Havok]], [[Iceman (Marvel Comics)|Iceman]], [[Jean Grey]] and [[Polaris (Marvel Comics)|Polaris]]), which led to the subsequent formation of the new team of X-Men (namely [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]], [[Thunderbird (John Proudstar)|Thunderbird]], [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]] and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]). The new X-Men team found the original X-Men and by using her powers, Polaris was able to launch Krakoa into outer space.<ref name="GSXM1" />

Krakoa was later apparently found and captured for study by the cosmic entity known as [[Stranger (comics)|The Stranger]], as seen when [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]] visited one of his 'laboratory worlds'.<ref>''Quasar'' #15. Marvel Comics.</ref> Krakoa was eventually freed along with many other specimens<ref>''Quasar'' #16. Marvel Comics.</ref> and was last seen orbiting around Earth until the energy wave from M-Day and the Collective awakened Vulcan.<ref>''X-Men: Deadly Genesis'' #1-6. Marvel Comics.</ref> It is also revealed that before it was shot into outer space, Krakoa released several spores from itself, which later plagued the X-Men.<ref name="Excalibur #31">''Excalibur'' #31. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Becoming a sovereign nation for mutants===
During the "[[House of X and Powers of X]]" stories, [[Professor X]] reveals to Cypher that he had approached Krakoa and took his time and efforts to bring forth the true entity of the island and eventually made a telepathic connection with Krakoa to the point that the relationship of mutant island and mutant man has only grown. More so, when Cypher communed with Krakoa at Xavier's urging, Krakoa related its past. According to Doug Ramsey, long ago, in ancient times, there was a single larger landmass called Okkara, which was attacked by an enemy that came from its core wielding a mystical blade known as the Twilight Sword. During the attack, Okkara was broken up and its conscious divided into two islands, Krakoa and [[List of Marvel Comics characters: A|Arakko]] (Arakko is Okkara in reverse and Krakoa an anagram), that seemingly acted as a yin and a yang which created some sort of a portal to a Hellish dimension known as Amenth, and demons poured out into the world. Fortunately, Apocalypse arrived with his First Horsemen and were able to thwart the attack by sealing of the chasm and isolating Arakko from Krakoa. The horsemen were sealed alongside Arakko on the other side of the chasm, to the sorrow of both Krakoa and Apocalypse.<ref>''Powers of X'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> As time passed, a mournful and lonely Krakoa eventually became inert until being reawakened in early 1945 due to testing from the Americans nuclear bomb drop.<ref>''Journey into Mystery: Birth of Krakoa'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Years later, Krakoa would be later transformed into a sovereign nation state for the entire mutant race. Led by Professor X, hero and villain alike are welcome on the shores of Krakoa, where the mutants are setting aside their old differences to build a new civilization with Krakoa producing flowers with the ability to grow in mere hours, full "Habitat" structures which are self-sustaining environments that are a part of the interconnected consciousness of Krakoa, that served as embassies around several countries on Earth, the [[Blue Area of the Moon]], the Green Area on [[Mars]] and beyond the solar system, all the while remaining connected to its hive mind via Gateways, which provided ways to instantly travel from one part of Krakoa to another. The gateways can only be access by mutants but if a mutant brings a human with them voluntarily, that human must ask for permission from Krakoa to use the gateway. The flowers also create No-Place, a habitat that exists outside the collective consciousness of Krakoa and where Moira MacTaggert has been hiding herself. Even Krakoa does not know this place exists. Krakoa is also the only place in the world to have special pills that extend human life by five years, a "universal" antibiotic and a cure for "disease of the mind, in humans".

Additionally, while Krakoa's main body lies in the Pacific Ocean not far from Australia, other small landmass parts of Krakoa are located off the coast of Africa in the mid-Atlantic Ocean, south of the [[Azores]] and west of the [[Canary Island]]. This island chain includes the Pointe, Transit and Danger Island which are connected in the same way as the "habitats" to the main body.
 
The government of Krakoa is headed by the [[Quiet Council of Krakoa|Quiet Council]]; and an organization called the Great Captains led by [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and consisting of [[Magik (Illyana Rasputin)|Magik]], [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] and [[Gorgon (comics)|Gorgon]]. Thanks to telepathic manipulation by Emma Frost, the vast majority of the world recognized Krakoa and established diplomatic/trade ties, with the exceptions of [[Wakanda]], Atlantis, Azania, Canaan, [[Kenya]], [[Honduras]], [[Brazil]], Santo Marco, Terra Verde, [[Venezuela]], [[Iran]], [[Madripoor]], [[North Korea]], [[Latveria]], and [[Russia]], for political and ideological reasons and/or because they belong in the Wakandan Economic Protectorate.<ref>''House of X'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>
 
More so, Emma Frost was allowed to carve out a piece of Krakoa so she could be given a private kingdom for herself outside the coast of the bay-area. Likewise, Bar Sinister, though not part of Krakoa, was added to its landmass with Flowers of Krakoa that modify the former secret base of Mister Sinister into a Krakoan Habitat, a diplomatic biome interconnected with the island nation's collective consciousness.

[[Cypher (comics)|Cypher]] also developed their own mutant language – Krakoan – which is psychically implanted when mutants come to the island and created an entire system to manage the traffic of the Krakoan network which is overseen by Sage. Since the island itself is sentient, Black Tom's plant-manipulating abilities gave him a unique bond that connected him to the island and all of its surrounding plant life. The subsequent connection meant an expansion of his field of awareness to include the plankton and kelp in the surrounding sea and the bacteria and spores floating in the air itself. In total, Black Tom's plant-based awareness gives him a 25-mile radius of acute sensitivity to all that enters and exits the island nation.

However, Krakoa's current achievements come at a steep price. To sustain itself, Krakoa must consume two mutants a year or take in other forms of mutant energy through a more sustainable workaround. Since Krakoa became home base for an ever-growing number of mutants, the island can sustain itself by taking a minimal, theoretically harmless amount of psychic energy from every mutant on its shores. That process is tightly monitored by two mutant "psychic vampires", [[Selene (comics)|Selene]] and [[Emplate]].

However, even with the island's considerable defenses, it seems Krakoa is still vulnerable. The first major attack on Krakoan soil is made by a shadowy anti-mutant group who were able to easily bypass Krakoa's defenses by capturing Domino and faking her bio signature, and while Black Tom's connection to Krakoa and its defense systems proves to be so advanced that Tom becomes alerted to the invasion before even the resident psychics Jean Grey and Charles Xavier himself, the attack nevertheless causes the death of several mutants.<ref>''X-Force'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Another attack was made by a small band of eco-terrorists known as Hordeculture, who proved capable of disrupting Krakoa's ecosystem by hacking Krakoa's biology and access its gates, which started taking a toll on the island's residents. Beyond some unusually aggressive wildlife and a minuscule decrease in landmass, Jean Grey, Emma Frost and the other telepaths on the island have already noticed that Krakoa is taking more psychic energy than normal.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 5 #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Later, another strange and mysterious island with a large volcano suddenly appeared off the coast of Krakoa making the island to change course and head towards it. With Doug Ramsey off-world, communication with Krakoa is difficult, if not impossible, so Cyclops enlisted Cable and Prestige, to investigate the new landmass. On arrival, they discover the large volcano contains glowing rainbow tentacles popping out of it and encounter thick jungle akin to the Savage Land and populated with otherworldly creatures and an equally other-worldy white, childlike being who identifies himself as a "High Summoner of Arakko", nameless beings that are capable of drawing forth extra-dimensional beings between the dimension where the lost land of Arakko is located and the land beyond the wild borders of Otherworld. After a misunderstanding with Cable, Prestige is able to give the High Summoner knowledge of Krakoan, enabling communication. The Summoner explains that Krakoa and this island are in love, implying that the mysterious landmass appears to be a sliver of Arakko. As Krakoa approaches the strange island, the two islands reach out their floral tendrils and merged into a single much larger island which is now divided between the lush of Krakoa and the forbidden alien terrain of the mysterious island which is named Arak Coral. The Volcano of Arak Coral is revealed to contain a portal to the dimension where Arakko is, which is not currently open.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 5 #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===[[X of Swords]]===
After creating the External Gate to reach the dimension where Arakko is located, Apocalypse sent Summoner with Banshee and Unus the Untouchable to herald his arrival. When Summoner reemerged with a wounded and dying Banshee, he pleaded for help and the issue of the External Gate was brought before the Quiet Council. Although the majority of the Quiet Council voted to destroy the External Gate due to its security risk, they were overruled by Krakoa who demanded that the Gate remain open.

After the Krakoan mutants defeated the Swordbearers of Arakko, Krakoa was final able to reunite with Arakko. However, as it turns out, they have no interest in unification because they have evolved from what they originally were, with their personalities becoming radically different over the incredibly long period of time that they have been apart, even needing Doug to translate for both of them.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 5 #16. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Inferno===
It was eventually discovered that the true motive for the creation of Krakoa as a nation was not to preserve mutantkind, but instead, was to eliminate it, since Moira had lost faith in the mutant dream after too many failed lives, and because her powers gave her an immense ability to inflict her will on mutant history, she hatched a plan to spend her final life avoiding Destiny and slowly boxing mutants in until she could use the mutant cure she had created in one of her past lives which works before mutant powers even manifest. However Moira's plan backfired when Doug Ramsey and his allies (the technological being Warlock, the Arakkoan warrior Bei the Blood Moon and the island of Krakoa itself) made a surprise appearance at No-Place, revealing that he had always been aware of Moira's presence, and knows she was conspiring with Professor X and Magneto. Moira's role in the founding of their country was eventually revealed, thanks to Emma Frost, to the entire ruling council of Krakoa, and they've all been sworn to secrecy about it.<ref>''Inferno'' #4</ref>

==The spawns of Krakoa==
There have been several spawns of Krakoa:

===Vega Superior===
The first known spore was Vega Superior, who took control of an island, later christened Wagner's isle, whose inhabitants began to worship him. When Nightcrawler crashed his plane there, he found Vega-Superior in the caves under the island, who had inherited his father's memories of the X-Men's genetic code, including that of Nightcrawler. He tries to choke Nightcrawler, but the latter manages to escape. He makes versions of the X-Men which Vega-Superior dubs the Vega-Men, out of natural materials, such as a Colossus made of stone, a Wolverine of ice, an Angel made of leaves and vines, a Nightcrawler made of mud and a Cyclops that shoots lava. However, they are much weaker than the original X-Men, and Nightcrawler easily defeats them all. Vega-Superior then chases him into the ocean before realizing he cannot swim.<ref name="Excalibur #31"/>

===Krakoa II===
Another spore of Krakoa took control of a construction site on a tropical island, and was discovered and defeated by the Young X-Men when they were investigating the disappearance of 56 construction workers.<ref>''Young X-Men'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Krakoa/Brood Hybrid===
Another spawn of Krakoa would be fabricated by the anti-mutant tech genius Kaga, creating his own hybrid out of [[Brood (comics)|Brood]] DNA to attack the X-Men at a later date. Eventually, the creature was cut down in the dawn of its conception by Cyclops in one shot.<ref>''Astonishing X-Men'' vol. 3 #33. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Krakoa III/X-Men's Krakoa===
Later when Wolverine and some of the X-Men splintered away from Cyclops' group, it is discovered that Beast has built the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning on top of a "male" spawn of Krakoa.<ref>''Wolverine and the X-Men'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> After [[Quentin Quire]] manages to reason with him, the Krakoa spawn contacts [[Rachel Summers]] who ends up translating for him when Rachel tells Wolverine that the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] made Krakoa attack them and that he is a mutant like the X-Men. Rachel discovered that this Krakoa was grown by Hellfire Club member Maximillian von Katzenelnbogen (a descendant of [[Victor Frankenstein]]) in his artificial supergarden.
