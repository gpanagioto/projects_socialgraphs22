Oh, really?!  Dude, this is gay! You shut up! Your girlfriend is not joining our band! 
"Conscientious." May I have the definition, please? "Conscientious." Could you use it in a sentence, please? "Conscientious." C O N S C I E N T I O U S. It was nice competing against you boys. We will have to do it again sometime. No. I live right over there.  I've lived there all my life. Because I'm home-schooled. My parent teach me. So I stay at home instead of going to school. Right.  Oh my goodness, are you two enemies? Strange, friends would call each other names and fight. Papa? Why can't I go to school with the other boys? But I want to play with the other children. O, how they laugh and play, Papá. I just feel like I should go to public school, if only for a little while. To see what other little boys are like. Please, Papá. Just let me try it for a few days. Hooray! Hey, guys. What's up? The answer is 1492. However, the Americas had already been discovered by many before him, including the Vikings and the Native Americans. And therefore, your question is a charade.  Oh. I promised my father I wouldn't. You mean you would actually duct-tape my entire body to a bench? For what purpose? Oh, dear. Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.  Well, they duct-taped me to a bench. I don't know, mother. It didn't make any sense at all. But I want to go back tomorrow, papá. Please, just give me one more day.   Can I sit here with you? Why do you call Kyle names and laugh at him? Is he not your friend? I see. It's like, you have to mark your territory as a boy. You have to socially find your place.  Ah! Stick and stones may break my bones, but words will never harm me. Huh? Oh, papá. Can I at least go to the dance tomorrow? Alright.  She's upstairs playing Doctor with that Kyle boy.  You're out of control. ''[turns to Kyle] You'' did this to my sister! You made my sister into a slut! I'll kill you!   ...I'm not through with you, bitch!   I know letting your kids out into the world is scary. I know you wish nothing bad would ever happen to us. But bad things will happen, and we have to start learning now how to deal with those things.  Thanks, gaywad.  See ya, papá!  
Hey, you guys, you'd better stop fighting. Who is that? Skyler, Timmy is what made our band famous. Yeah.   Hn they want us back.  
Wow. That is about the nicest Trapper Keeper ''I've'' ever seen.  Well that does it. I'm gonna have to report this.  
Relax, Linda, everything's fine.  No, uh, it's lemon juice. No, it just really, really, really hurts!  Where are your parents?!  ...Okay, I'm scared now, too. That freaked me out. Get off me!  What the hell is gong on here?! Alright, kid! We demand to see an adult this instant! The mayor! Good! Finally! No parents in the entire town? What happened to them? No phones, either? How do you communicate? Alright, we've had just about enough here! That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen! I don't care what little games you kids wanna play, we just want outta here, alright?  I have the job interview of my life in Breckenridge! Just tell me how to get to a phone or a car! Look! If getting the stupid book will get me a cell phone, I don't care!  Well, I ''told'' you I can't deal with kids, Linda! That's why I don't want to have children! Oh, let's not go through this again, Linda. D-  it makes no sense. It's a boy.  They... killed him. Oh no!    Why are you doing this? Who? Look, ''I'' have the job interview of my life in less than-  -12 hours! I just need a phone, and he said he'd help me if I took your book so you couldn't... kill them anymore. I'll do anything to get to a phone! Ah-ah-ah-ah,let me get this straight: if I go get the fat kid's book on the other side of the white line, you'll show me where a cell phone is? No, uh, it's it's it's right out here. Come on.  Linda, I want you to just go back to the car and wait for me, alright? I'll go get that fat kid's book so I can use their phone. I know, but this will all be over soon. Alright, I got the book for you.  Now, can I please have the cell phone? Give him the book back. Enough of this! You kids are all in big trouble!  Stop right there! Nobody's killing anybody tonight! What?  Is that what happened to the adults here?! You lied to the police and said they molested you?! My God, they were your parents! The birth-givers! Your birth-givers.  He won't take care of you. Your parents... your... providers... will.  Ten days?? It's only been ten days since they left?? Yeah, I guess you're right. Maybe we ''should'' have some. Yeah. I got the job. You're looking at the new manager of Denny's in Breckenridge.  Well, what are you kids gonna do now? 
But... they're... children! I just think that all this sex ed and condom talk in elementary school is wrong! I don't think we have any that'll even fit them! 
Hi! All right! Let's play!  All right! Go Dave! Where be your gibes now? Your gambols? Your songs?  That's a great story, Sarah. All right! Woohoo! OOWW! Only the most important person in the world. I'm a lion.  We'd miss you too, Gary. Heh. Let's go.   Wow, what a great house! Well, Stan, it's all a matter of faith. 
Yeah, I agree with the last caller. I was in a restaurant and ordered the gluten-free quinoa salad, and a guy right next to me was eating a sandwich. It's like "Get your second-hand gluten away from me!" 
 I am the founder and chairman of Facebook. But I also have a shtoile that is completely unblockable. Thank you, right?  Alright, everyone here wants to see my shtoile. But first, what I'll need is a volunteer. Yes, you sir. You say these things like they are my fault, and yet they are not. Ha ha ha ha ha! Now I see you're trying to use your shtoile over mine. Now, you try to block me.  Yes, what is your question? I was invited here by people.  Ha ha ha, this puny refrigerator could not block me. What makes you think you can? So, where are we headed? Perhaps we should get some food. You call this a car? It wasn't even remotely able to block me. What is this car's shtoile? Ha ha ha ha. You say I am a penis and yet I am not a penis.  So, you are trying to block me, huh? That's fine. What's your shtoile? I was invited here. I am only making use of a bed for sleeping, yehhhs?  You should have worked with me when you had the chance. Now you lie over there, dead. Bwaaaaaa! So, this is the Coon and Friends that you have told me about.  I warn you, my fighting shtoile is unsurpassed. You want to get to Butters, riiight? You're gonna have to get through me, huuuh?! Simple. He paid me $17.23. Come on! What's your shtoile? So, you think you can block me. Ha ha ha! You cannot block me!   Ha ha ha, you saw me walk right through the police barricade and yet you think you can block me, riiight? Go ahead and try.  Ha ha ha ha ha!  Oh...  Hagh. Ow. I have never witness this shtoile before.  Rwaaaar! Ha ha ha, you tried to match my shtoile and failed! What what what what are you talking about? But, but hold on, that, that's not true. Noooooooo!
