Okay. What if you don't have any rhythm? Well, like my friend Kyle. He's Jewish, so he doesn't have any rhythm. Oh, that's good. We need some more toilet paper. <i>[the other kids laugh]</i> Hey, don't flip me off, you son of a bitch! <i>[drops down and pleads]</i> Please, Mr. Mackey, we'll be good. Don't send us to that ole kids' choir. Have mercy, Mr. Mackey. <i>[as he enters the bus]</i> Aw, man, this is gonna suck donkey balls. Whoopee. Yeah, pretty much. <i>[hushed]</i> The nightmare begins. Oh my God! Dude, look at how dirty and crappy everything is! Well, why the hell don't they get jobs?! <i>[Throws open his window and yells]</i> Ey! Why don't you people quit slacking off, and get a job! What's wrong with you?! Go to college! <i>[sits]</i> Look, you've gotta be firm with these people or they just slack off and be poor forever. Right, Kenny? <i>[Kenny looks at him angrily]</i> Hey, maybe that's it, Kenny. Maybe you're Costa Rican; that's why your family's so poor. Whoa, dude, look over there! <i>[The bus stops. There are three women in front of a shop. A man has just dropped them off, pays them and drives away, and they wave at him.]</i> Wow! Costa Rican prostitutes! Hey, look at the prostitutes, you guys! Okay. <i>[pretends]</i> Cleek! <i>[grins]</i> <i>[rushing out]</i> Oh my God,  it smells like ass out here. <i>[covers his nose again]</i> I wasn't saying anything about their culture, I was just saying their city smells like ass. I don't think it's funny! This place is overcrowded, smelly, and poor! That's not funny, that sucks! Why? Eh-heheh! I told you Jewish people don't have rhythm! <i>[impatient]</i> Yeah yeah yeah, take steps to protect it, blah blah blah.  We hear this a million times back up in the States. <i>[takes a branch and starts beating the monkey]</i> Bad! Bad monkey! <i>[it screams in pain]</i> <i>[stops]</i> I'm asserting myself. It's tough love. Just like my Mr. Kitty. When he's bad I say, “Uh that a bad Mr. Kitty!” and I smack him on the head! <i>[takes the branch and starts beating the sloth]</i> It's bad! It's a bad three-toed sloth! <i>[throws the branch at the sloth]</i> Re’spect my authoritah! <i>[fed up, buries his face in his mitts]</i> Aagh Ghyod, here she goes again!! He's a little wuss, what's it look like? <i>[Stan is hiding behind some foliage]</i> Yeah, that snake is really scared of us all right! <i>[beats the snake, which turns and comes at him]</i> Bad! That's a bad snay-ah! <i>[hurries away, and the snake gives chase]</i> <i>[moves forward]</i> Let me try, let me try. We are from America. A-me-ri-ca. <i>[the soldier listens]</i> We are lost and verry hungry. Necesito burri-tos. <i>[rubs his belly]</i> Y taco. Two tostadas and mih-um enchilito.  This is bullcrap! I am not following this stupid hippie around anymore. I'm going this way!  Nononono! You ''nyah'', me ''nyah''!  Screw you guys, I'ma going home. <i>[walks away]</i> God-damned stupid hippie activist! I should be home nestled in the couch with my Mr. Kitty right now watching Fat Abbot cartoons and eat-   Mister! You've gotta help me! I'm ''starving'' to death! I was with my class, and we got all lost in the rainforest, and I need some food. I'm fading fast! Food! I have to have food!     Who'd you expect? Merv Griffin?
