==Fictional character biography==
Shalla-Bal is the Empress of her [[utopian]] [[planet]], [[Zenn-La]] (in the Deneb System, Milky Way Galaxy), and was the lover of Norrin Radd. When the planet-eating [[Galactus]] came to their planet, Norrin Radd volunteered to become the herald of Galactus in exchange for sparing Zenn-La. Norrin Radd was given the Power Cosmic and became the [[Silver Surfer]], thus separating him from Shalla-Bal for a long time.<ref>recounted in ''Silver Surfer'' Vol. 1 #1</ref>

Eventually, the Surfer rebelled against Galactus, who trapped him on the planet [[Earth]] as a [[punishment]].  The demon [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] who desires to defeat the Surfer and steal his noble soul, sensed the anguish of this separation within him, and used Shalla-Bal as a pawn in his conflict with the Surfer.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' Vol. 1 #3</ref> As part of a conspiracy Mephisto replaced the consciousness of Shalla-Bal so that she believed herself to be a regular citizen of [[Latveria]] named '''Helena''', and [[Doctor Doom]] organized a false marriage celebration with her in order to make the Surfer fight the [[Fantastic Four]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #155-157</ref>

Meanwhile, Galactus consumed the life energies and ecosphere of Zenn-La because of Silver Surfer's betrayal, but spared the lives of its people by warning them of his coming beforehand, allowing them to return to the lifeless husk afterwards. When [[Mister Fantastic]] freed the Surfer from his imprisonment, he returned to Zenn-La to find it in this state and learned that Shalla-Bal had been abducted by Mephisto. Finally understanding the conspiracy Surfer returned to Latveria to find Shalla-Bal meanwhile imprisoning himself once again on the [[Earth]].  The Surfer bestowed a portion of his [[Power Cosmic]] to Shalla-Bal while Mephisto was sending her back to her planet, and she was able to use this power to restore the life on Zenn-La.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' Vol. 2 #1</ref> She was thus accepted as an Empress by her people.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' Vol. 3 #2</ref>  However the responsibilities of her office made Shalla-Bal refuse marriage with the Surfer when he eventually broke free from Earth for good, and he told her that their romance was over.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' Vol. 3 #7</ref> However, she was then held hostage by the [[Elders of the Universe|Elders]], but was rescued by the Silver Surfer.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' Vol. 3 #8-9</ref>

Shalla-Bal later met the [[Kree]] leader, Nenora.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' Vol. 3 #20</ref> Shalla asked the Surfer to protect Zenn-La from the [[Obliterator (comics)|Obliterator]].<ref>''Silver Surfer'' Vol. 3 #21</ref> Shalla made an alliance with the [[Skrull]] Empress [[S'byll]] against the Kree Empire. She was informed by the [[Cotati (comics)|Cotati]] that Nenora was actually a disguised Skrull. Shalla was captured by Nenora's Kree [[Sentry (Kree)|Sentry]], but freed by the Cotati. She told S'byll and the Surfer about Nenora's true nature, and was returned to Zenn-La by the Surfer.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' Vol. 3 #25-31</ref>

Shalla was later taken captive by the Enslavers, and was then reunited with the Surfer.<ref>''Silver Surfer: The Enslavers''</ref> Shalla was seen in flashback telling Norrin Radd about his father's suicide.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' Vol. 3 #50</ref> She was seen in flashback again at her first meeting with Norrin Radd when they were children.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' Vol. 3 #57</ref> Shalla-Bal was later abducted with the planet Zenn-La by the Great One. Shalla was briefly reunited with the Silver Surfer, but disintegrated along with the Great One's pocket universe.<ref>''Silver Surfer: Homecoming''</ref> The Surfer later returned her to life after her soul had been imprisoned by Mephisto.<ref>''Silver Surfer/Warlock: Resurrection'' #1-4</ref>

After years of rejection, Shalla-Bal once became romantically involved with Fennan Radd, a man who claimed to be the Silver Surfer's half-brother by his father. Fennan claimed to have been born after Norrin's mother Elmar committed suicide.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' Vol. 3 #101</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
As a member of the race of aliens known as Zenn-Lavians, Shalla-Bal has an extraordinarily long life span. Hence, Shalla-Bal has lived for centuries although she is still physically a young woman.

Shalla-Bal was once able to restore life to Zenn-La's ecosphere due to a fragment of the Silver Surfer's [[Power Cosmic|power cosmic]] that he placed within her. Apparently she can still cause plant life to grow wherever she walks.

Shalla-Bal is accomplished in administering government.
