Welcome, everyone, to the 10 and under pony dressage finals. We want to thank everyone for coming out today to support these little riders. It all comes down to this. Number 8-2-3, Davey Solokov and his Russian Etruscan. If he completes this last rail, he will be the winner. Rider...please demonstrate your trot. And here is the rail. Wait a minuteâ€”we have another pony in the ring!
