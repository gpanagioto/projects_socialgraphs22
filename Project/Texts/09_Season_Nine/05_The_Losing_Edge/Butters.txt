''I see a ladybug''- Hello lady ladybug.  Well yeah, but... we usually win. Yeah. My dad always said "It's Okay to lose, but if you don't try, wuh you're grounded, Mister." We'd better hope they never know, or else there's gonna be heck to pay. Heck, I tell ya! Oh no! Aw hamburgers.   Son of a biscuit!
