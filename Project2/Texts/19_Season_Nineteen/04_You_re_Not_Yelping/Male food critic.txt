 Hi, two of us for lunch, please. Oh, and uh, I just wanted to mention that my wife and I are Yelp reviewers, so uh, your best table, please. Hm, this place seems, nice. D'I guess we'll see, won't we? Look here, my good man, we've been waiting over 15 minutes for you to sing Happy Birthday to our son! You're gonna regret this, Whistlin' Willy. You can't treat Yelpers this way. AH!  And so we said "to hell with it!" And we took the challenge to go from the town's food critics to the town's spiritual leaders! What do we want?
