<poem><i>I am going to tear down your safe space! Brick by brick, I shall smash it with glee!</i></poem> <poem><i>You cannot stop me from getting inside! I am cold and I am hard, and my name... is Reality.</i></poem> <poem><i>Drat!</i></poem> <poem><i>Nooooo... </i></poem> HaHAA! So you're the one trying to destroy me, eh?? You little shit! Keep me out, will you? You can't stop me!   I shit on all of you!  Look at you, Vin Dipshit. You think fat-shaming is wrong, so in response you show off your abs. You're the one fat-shaming, idiot! What's the matter with you people?! You're saaad that people are meeean? Well I'm sorry, the world isn't one big liberal arts college campus! We eat too much; we take our spoiled lives for granted, feel a little bad about it sometimes! No, you wanna put up all your shit on the Internet and have every single person say "Hooray for you!" Fuck you. You're all pricks. And I've got news for you! While you've all been sitting here trying to feel good, the little boy who sucked all your shit is about to die from it!
