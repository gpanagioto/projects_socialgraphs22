Doctor, doctor! Will our daughter be okay? Oh no! NO! My poor little Helen. She can't see or hear us, John. I know! How about, instead of a dog, Helen Keller has a pet turkey. Do you think we could make up a good Thanksgiving play in four days? Oh, no! She can't see hear, John. Watch. Helen! Oh no! Oh no!!!  There is nothing we can do for our poor daughter. We cannot reach her.
