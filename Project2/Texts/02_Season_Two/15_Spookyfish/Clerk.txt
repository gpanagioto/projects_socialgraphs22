Can I help you boys?  Damn it! That's the ninth return I've had this week! What's wrong with it?  Ap! Let me guess. It killed a bunch of people, right? Damn it!  Well, there was an Indian burial ground here before I bought it. Oh, hell no! First I dug up all the bodies, pissed on 'em, then buried them again upside down. Why? I don't know. I was drunk. Well, that certainly would explain a lot. Well, like this.  I've been wondering what the hell this was. I can't give you your money back. No! I won't take it back! All right, you win.  Who are you? I don't know who you mean? No! Stop! You don't know what you're doing! Those pets are evil!
