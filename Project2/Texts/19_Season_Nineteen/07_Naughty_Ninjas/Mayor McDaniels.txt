This town is outraged, Officer Barbrady! People are tired of the police not being held accountable for their actions! You shot an unarmed six year old Latino child! You're fired. You're from another time, Barbrady. And the last thing that needs to go. Your gun and your badge.  And your sunglasses. Latino-American. You should go away. You don't belong anywhere in a town as progressive as this one. Why are they all suddenly coming here? When a town like ours has a homeless problem it must look at the root of what's causing it. What if they won't help us with the homeless? The town is in danger, alright? We don't know what these kids are capable of. Sh, look, look look, Barbrady, Barbrady! We were wrong about you. I... was wrong about you. You... protected this town back before anybody else ever did. You used to do it all on your own. We need you to do that again.  What were you thinking?! Boys innocently playing ninja and you pull your gun on them? We thought they were. But if it turns out they aren't, as a policeman, you have to figure that out! I'm sorry, but we just can't cover your ass on this one. There's going to be an investigation and ... you just don't have what it takes to be a policeman in today's times. Yes.
