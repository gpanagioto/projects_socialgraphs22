FELLAS! Fellas! You'll never guess what happened. Butters just beat up Scott Malkinson! It was crazy! Scott was just talking about how he needed to take his insulin shot, and out of nowhere Butters said he's sick of people with diabetes feeling sorry for themselves. Scott told Butters to shut up and Butters just started whaling on him! Dude, I'm telling you! Butters beat the crap out of Scott, and then he locked himself in the bathroom!  Well. Apparently Kenny is Butters' best friend. You guys gonna make out, Kenny?  ...Wow. Holy shit balls! Holy shit balls! Guess what, you guys? Holy shit balls.  Butters just got on a bus with his backpack and said he's going to Hawaii. He said he had to go back to his homeland, and then told me it was none of my business and to keep my fat mouth shut. Yeah, Mr. Perfect, go rescue Butters so he can lick your balls some more.
