Well, not any more than any other student. I don't know! I can't be around every second! All right, all right, I killed him. I hit him over the head and I cut up the body. I tried to burn him, but it wouldn't burn! Oh, the smell of it! I put the legs in garbage bags and hid the torso under a bridge. I HAD TO DO IT!!  OH GOD!!!   Oh, dear God! We're ruined! Oh..!
