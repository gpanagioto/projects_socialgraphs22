Good morning, girls.  How did I get such a beautiful wife? I love you too, Princess. I love both of you, equally.  Nobody. L-let's just get you girls to school. Is it bigger than a bread box?  Oh my God.  AAAAAH! Let's bail!  WAAH! Tolkien. No, Tolkien, we had nothing to do with this. I know you're pissed off, but but be reasonable! No! Nonono!  We're safe, girls! Daddy did it!
