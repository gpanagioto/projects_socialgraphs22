I'm gonna pick you boys up right here at 4:00, you got it? What's going on? Sir, please, my son is in there! What's happened? Oh my God. I've gotta help him!  You can't just leave my son in there with all that pee! It's the pee! It's all pee, and nobody can go in or out! Sharon, the water park had a pee meltdown! They think a lot of people have died. I don't know! The whole water park has been quarantined! They're worried anyone left alive could be... sssome kind of raging, hate-filled mutants. Calm down, Sharon, all right?!  Calm down! They're trying to find an antidote. Once they believe they can neutralize the enraging effects of the pee, they'll, they'll go in to look for survivors. I'll do it.  Give me the banana.  Aww, ooogh, Aaaaaaaah. Aaaaaahhh. Aw, awww. No, wait, wait! Ugh. Eugh. I... I'm okay.
