Hey guys! Sup, Jason?  Oh! Tha-oh, yeah, the the startup company thing didn't really work out. We were- trying to be funny. Doesn't anyone understand the significance of "I'm sorry" anymore? Well, I guess let's just be thankful we're not Butters. They won't even let him come back to school. I don't know what we're going to do? It's been like four hours and people still won't talk to us. Dude, that would have to be like, the best party ever.  Hey, that might work. But it can't be a party for us. No no, he's right! We've gotta make it for someone in need so that people have to go. A band! Holy shit, Stan! Didn't you say your dad knows somebody who knows Lorde? Yeah, it's going to be this weekend. Nope! We're gonna have all the pizza you can eat, twenty different cakes, and Lorde is going to play live! Hey Cartman. Dude, calm down. Who took all the pizza and the cake?  What the hell? Cartman? Come on, dude. You have to get up. That's right, we've still got Lorde. You talked to your dad, right Stan? Cartman, we can't do this alone. You have to get up. We're not bailing on the party, we're just think there's... more important things right now! Jesus Christ, dude. Cartman? Hey, we'd do anything for our bros, man. We're good, Scott. Stop bugging us.
