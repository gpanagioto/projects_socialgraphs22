Mr. President, people are starting to question your oath to the office. How are we supposed to put a positive spin on it? I don't know anything, I'm just a turtle. And then we don't have to get killed! We can't let the President know about this. just let him-  No, nope! Cha cha cha. Cha cha cha. Looks like many more years of the same are to come.
