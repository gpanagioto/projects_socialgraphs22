 Listen everybody, I uh... I owe Kyle a big apology and I... I wanna do it in fromt of everyone because... ugh... I was wrong, Kyle. I'm afraid that... Kyle and I got into a little disagreement yesterday. Yeah, yeah it's... pretty nasty. And um, I was totally wrong and you were right, Kyle. I thought only humans could be gingers. Is Davin here? Davin Miller?  Oh yeah, there you are. I own an apology to you too, Davin. When Kyle said that humans weren't the only species that can have light skin and freckles I totally laughed in his face. But it turns out Kyle was right: there are other animals that can be ginger as well I didn't believe it. I guess I didn't ''want'' to believe it, but this morning I saw a red-haired light-skinned cow and I owe you, Kyle, and you, Davin, my sincerest apology.  Oh would you- Would you guys like to see it? There! There it is right there, see? A red-headed cow.   You were right, Kyle. A ginger cow. I shall never question your keen intellect again! Yes! Yeah, be sure to get some pictures of it!  What? What joke? This is real! No,  no, you were right, Kyle. I was wrong. Thank you, Butters!  Yeah, be sure to show everyone, guys. It's really amazing. Heheh, too good, too too good. Yes, you're right, Kyle. I'm sure that ''that''... is going to have earth-shattering consequences. Heheheheh.   Well I just ran to the school and told everyone, "Hey, there's a redheaded cow outside; you should all see it." I'm pretty sure that this cow could make ginger cheese, which is like a Swiss cheese, except instead of holes, it has freckles.  Hey Kyle. Y-you got a minute? I've gotta tell you something, Kyle. The red-headed cow... isn't real. I made him up. I totally lied, Kyle. And when you asked me if I had lied, I looked you right in the eye and said "No." I owe you an apology and, I mean it.  No! No, Kyle, you said that it's ''never'' for the best. Remember that? And you're right. You're right, Kyle! But it's not true. Kyle, I'm being serious. I really think I have to tell the truth! I I don't know how I can live with this. I don't think I can unless eh, unless I don't know mm-maybe you c-called your mom a fat skank?  Maybe if you'd said that to your mom and... told her that her tits belonged in a morgue, then, maybe somehow I could live with this lie. You're right. You're right, Kyle. I should just tell the truth and be done with it!   Kyle! Oh my gosh, what did you just say?? Ohh my God!  Ms. Broflovski, are you okay? Does he always talk to you like that?   Oh, looks like most everyone's here. Um, wasn't there something you wanted to say, Kyle? Remember about the...? You what??  Let's see what I can muster up here. Let's see. Oh! Oh!   Oh, Mr. Mackey, could I-Oh, uhhh. Hey, sorry, am I interrupting?  Kyle, are you sure? Well alright.  Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. What sounds better in your mouth tomorrow? Thai or Greek? I care, Kyle. You should have a say in this; they're your yummy farts. Should we go with Thai? You're gonna... come with me... to Israel, Kyle?  Huh? You comin'?  Okay. I want the whole world to see how much you love my farts. Plane leaves tomorrow.  Thank you everyone. It's my honor to have been a part of this... miracle. Isn't that right, Fartboy? Are you sure, Fartboy? I've had a lot of strange food on this trip. Small penis?! No, Kyle, you were right. I see now that little lies can cause huge problems. No, it's not, Kyle. I have a huge dick. Cheer up, Kyle. I'm sure this isn't the first time someone who thought they were suffering for humanity was actually just sucking farts. Hey. How about we get a little dessert, help cheer you up?
