How's it going, everybody? Hey dude. Sup?  What do you mean? We're just... going to school. Ogh! Noo, noo, you guys, guys, what what we said was- Dude, people are pissed off at us. Yeah! Well said, Kyle! Good point! What, what happened to the significance? You know what we gotta do, guys?  We've gotta throw a big fuckin' party Yeah! How do you make everyone like you? You have a big party and invite everyone and then everyone thinks you're cool! Well I'm down. Between the four of us we can throw the sweetest party ever, and these assholes won't even remember us being dicks to them. Right, it's gotta be an awesome party for... What? We lure people in with a cause and then hit 'em over the head with the best party ever. We're gonna have pizza and cake and a sweet band! Oh my God, we've got Lorde to play live. So who do we throw the party for? You know, we just wanted to give back to the community and show everyone a good time. You, you know diabetes affects us all, but it mostly affects Scott Malkinson. "I actually have plans this weekend. I'm Scott Malkinson. I've got diabetes." Believe it, dude. What the hell is gluten? KYLE! IT'S ALL GONE! THEY'VE TAKEN IT ALL! WHY ARE THEY DOING THIS?! KYLE! KYLE! THERE'S NO SNACKS LEFT, KYLE! THEY TOOK ALL THE SNACKS AND THE PIZZA AND THE CAKE AND WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE A PARTY! KYYYLE! What's the point? Everyone hates us at school and our party's gonna suck. What kind of epic party can you have without pizza and cake? Now all we've got is Lorde. You know what I'mm gonna miss most? Pancakes. I keep having dreams of Aunt Jemima. She's trying to tell me something. But then she just fades away.  There's nothing left, you guys! The world is upside down. Things aren't gonna get better, they're gonna get worse. Aunt Jemima.  I don't know the way, Aunt Jemima. I don't even know what that means. Are you going to eat those pancakes? Oooo, trippy... They've got what backward?   Oh! Ohhh, oh. Hoooh. Fuck, I want pancakes. KYYYLE! KYYYLE, WHAT DOES USDA STAND FOR?! AUNT JEMINA SAID USDA HAS TO LOOK AT THE PYRAMID! My name isn't important. What matters is that... the answer is in the pyramid. What, what is it? What is it for? It's upside down. Sir, the pyramid is upside down. Yeah well, I'm glad people aren't mad at you anymore. I know what that feels like. Yeah yeah, enjoy the party.
