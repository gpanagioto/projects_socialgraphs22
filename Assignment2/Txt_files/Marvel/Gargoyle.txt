'''Gargoyle''' is a name shared by two [[fictional character]]s appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
The first Gargoyle, '''Yuri Topolov''', appears in ''[[Hulk|The Incredible Hulk]]'' #1 (May 1962), and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=145}}</ref>

The appearance of Gargoyle in ''Rampaging Hulk'' #1 is merely part of one of [[Bereet]]'s fictional techno-art films.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} The first Gargoyle received an entry in ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition]]'' #17, where his real name was revealed.

The second Gargoyle, '''Isaac Christians''', is a human/demon hybrid and a member of the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]. He was created by writer [[J. M. DeMatteis]] and artist [[Don Perlin]]. Perlin's design was inspired by a sequence in ''[[Prince Valiant]]'' in which the titular hero disguises himself as a gargoyle.<ref name="back65">{{cite journal |last=DeAngelo|first=Daniel|date=July 2013|title=The Not-Ready-For-Super-Team Players: A History of the Defenders |journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=#65|page=12 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref> During his long run on ''The Defenders'', Gargoyle also was the co-star of ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #119, written by his co-creator DeMatteis, who later described the issue as "one of my favorite ''favorite'' stories".<ref name="DAK39"/>

In 1985 Marvel published a four-issue ''Gargoyle'' [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]], written by DeMatteis and drawn by [[Mark Badger]]. DeMatteis said of the series, "It was a psychological fantasy. You take the interior life and make it concrete... give it substance... and play with it".<ref>{{cite news | first1 = Jim | last1 = Salicrup | first2 = Mike | last2 = Higgins | authorlink1 = Jim Salicrup | date = September 1986 | title = J.

We'd had him in ''Defenders'' for years and Don Perlin and I were... We came to like him so much, ''as a person''... this was a classic case of the character coming alive for us. We came to like Isaac Christians, this little old man inside the Gargoyle's body, so much that it began to mellow out the way we portrayed the outer shell, the gargoyle aspect. And, before you know it, he's this cute little funny animal. Which he was never intended to be.<ref name="DAK39">{{cite news | first1 = Jim | last1 = Salicrup | first2 = Mike | last2 = Higgins | date = October 1986 | title = J.

In a 2013 interview DeMatteis said that Gargoyle "is a character I still have tremendous fondness for".<ref name="back65"/>

'''Yuri Topolov''', was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] scientist and the [[Hulk]]'s first foe. An atomic accident caused by working with [[radiation]] mutated him into a grotesque, but large-headed [[Dwarfism|dwarf]]. The Gargoyle is informed about the Hulk by an imprisoned spy using a miniature [[Transistor|transmitter]]. By firing a gun with will-weakening pellets, he succeeded in capturing both him and [[Rick Jones (character)|Rick Jones]]. Bruce Banner cured him of his [[mutation]] via [[gamma rays]]. He gratefully used his rocket to send them back into the United States. Topolov managed to destroy several Soviet generals and 'die like a man' in an explosion he set off.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' #1</ref> However, he passed this deformity onto his son, the [[Gremlin (comics)|Gremlin]].<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' Vol 2 #163 (May 1973)</ref>

Topolov later turned up alive, because his own death is a deliberate fake. He was frozen by the USSR in a [[Cryostasis (clathrate hydrates)|cryogenic sleep]] near the [[Cold War]]'s end, along with some other agents. They were accidentally awakened in this modern day and fought [[The Order (comics)|the Order]].<ref>''The Order'' Vol 2 #1-2 (September-October 2007)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
As the first Gargoyle, Yuri Topolov was a superhuman genius. Even with or without his powers, he still knows numerous sciences and is well-versed in mechanical theory.

'''Isaac Christians''' was an elderly man who sold his soul to an alliance of minor demons styling themselves as "The Six-Fingered Hand" in exchange for prosperity for the dying hometown that his ancestors had founded (the fictional town of Christiansboro, Virginia). Christians made a pact with the demon Avarrish to inhabit the body of a legendary gargoyle and act as an agent of the Six-Fingered Hand. The demons of the Six-Fingered Hand transferred Christians' life force into the Gargoyle body and sent him on a mission to capture [[Patsy Walker]], at that time operating as [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] member Hellcat. Christians battled the Defenders, but rebelled against the Six-Fingered Hand. He was trapped in the gargoyle's body, but joined the Defenders.<ref>''The Defenders'' #94. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> The Defenders then helped him defeat the Six-Fingered Hand.<ref>''The Defenders'' #99-100. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

As a member of the Defenders, Gargoyle helped the [[Squadron Supreme]] defeat the [[Overmind (comics)|Overmind]] and Null the Living Darkness.<ref>''The Defenders'' #112-114. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> The Gargoyle briefly fell under the control of an Afghan wizard, and he was forced to battle the Defenders.<ref>''The Defenders'' #136-13. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

Christians later returned to Christianboro, and was later released from the Gargoyle body and the original demon spirit re-inhabited it. Christians, to prevent the chaos being wreaked by the gargoyle, re-assumed the body with the help of a druid and killed his original human body to prevent the demon from returning.<ref>''Gargoyle'' #1-4. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

[[Moondragon]], under the influence of the [[Dragon of the Moon]], later separated Christians' life force from the gargoyle body. The body was to be used as a vessel for the Dragon of the Moon, and it became larger and more grotesque. The gargoyle body was carbonized and transformed into a statue of ash, when the Defenders defeated Moondragon and the Dragon of the Moon.<ref>''The Defenders'' #152. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

Christians' life force came to reside in a crystal talisman. He reconciled with the spirit of Moondragon, and journeyed with [[Sundragon|Pamela Douglas]] to [[Titan (Marvel Comics location)|Titan]], where he witnessed the rebirth of Moondragon. The former Defender known as Cloud created a new body for Christians, with the ability to switch between his gargoyle and human forms at will.<ref>''Solo Avengers'' #16, 18, 20. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

Alongside the [[Presence (Marvel Comics)|Presence]], [[Starlight (Marvel Comics)|Starlight]], [[Jack of Hearts (Marvel Comics)|Jack of Hearts]], and others, he returned to Earth from the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]]'s laboratory world.<ref>''Quasar'' #19-20. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

When the final confrontation between [[Gabriel, Devil Hunter]], and [[Daimon Hellstrom|Hellstrom]] left Gabriel irretrievably insane, only capable of babbling incoherently, Hellstrom left him in the care of the Gargoyle.<ref>''[[Daimon Hellstrom|Hellstorm]]'' #21. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

Following the "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]" storyline, Christians was one of the registered superhumans seen in ''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' #1. He was shown flying in an attack against [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]];<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #2 (July 2007). Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> this helped save the President from an assassination attempt. He is shown in battle against [[KIA (comics)|KIA]].<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #8-11</ref> Gargoyle was also seen aiding [[Patsy Walker|Hellcat]].<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' vol. 2 #3-4</ref> He ignored Nighthawk's offer to join the Last Defenders<ref>''The Last Defenders'' #1</ref> and remained at [[Camp Hammond (comics)|Camp Hammond]] to serve as an instructor training the Initiative cadets<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #12.</ref> before retiring.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #21 (2007). Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> He returns to assist in defeating a deranged copy of Thor called 'Ragnarok'.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #22 (2007). Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

[[Kraven the Hunter (Alyosha Kravinoff)|Alyosha Kravinoff]] later captured Gargoyle and placed him in his zoo for animal-themed superhumans which also consisted of [[Bushmaster (Marvel Comics)|Bushmaster]], [[Tiger Shark (Marvel Comics)|Tiger Shark]], [[Kangaroo (comics)|Kangaroo]], [[Aragorn (comics)|Aragorn]] (the version that was owned by the Vatican Black Knight), [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]], [[Mongoose (comics)|Mongoose]], [[Man-Bull]], [[Dragon Man (comics)|Dragon Man]], [[Swarm (comics)|Swarm]], [[Mandrill (comics)|Mandrill]], [[Grizzly (comics)|Grizzly]], [[Frog-Man]], and [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]].<ref>''The Punisher War Journal'' vol. 2 #13–15. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

Isaac Christians later opened up a restaurant called Isaac's Oysters in [[Greenwich (village), New York|Greenwich]] with [[Frog-Man|Eugene Patilio]] as his busboy. Both of them were approached by Iron Man for help in rescuing James Rhodes from [[Korvac]].<ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 6 #5. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The second Gargoyle is the result due to a magical transfer of Isaac Christians' spirit into an ancient gargoyle body. In this form, Gargoyle possesses supernatural strength and durability, as well as a thick leathery hide. He has the ability to manipulate "biomystical" [[Energy (esotericism)|energy]] for numerous effects, such as shapeshifting, concussive blasts, and fear inducement. He could siphon life-forces from other people, causing temporary debilitating weakness onto them. Surrounding himself in a biomystical field granted Gargoyle immunity to certain spells. Gargoyle is able to fly via levitation; his wings were incapable of producing sufficient lift, but useful for [[navigation]]. Christians can regenerate lost or damaged limbs, although they would differ wildly in appearance from the original limb. Overexpenditure of these energies in a short time might weaken or even kill him. Not only that, he could also be commanded to act against his will by an evil [[Wizard (fantasy)|wizard]] who spoke a particular obscure spell. Isaac Christians was a student of the [[occult]] with minor [[Mysticism|mystical]] capabilities. Prior to his transformation, he had considerable knowledge of magic, including rudimentary [[Incantation|spellcasting]] and summoning demons.<ref>''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe'' Vol 2 #5 (April 1986)</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
* The Yuri Topolov version of Gargoyle appeared in the Hulk segment of ''[[The Marvel Super Heroes]]'', but he was called the Gorgon and not the Gargoyle in the TV version of the comic.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}
* The Yuri Topolov version of Gargoyle appeared in the 1996 ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1996 TV series)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Mark Hamill]]. Gargoyle is always trying to find a cure for his mutation even allying himself with [[Leader (comics)|Leader]]. In the episode "Mortal Bounds", he accidentally released a gamma virus (infecting amongst others [[Betty Ross]]) in his search for a cure where he was restored to a near normal state yet also infected. When Betty Ross was dying from the virus, Gargoyle gave Bruce Banner the antidote as Gargoyle is also cured. Before leaving, Gargoyle warns Banner that the next time they met he would not be so favorable. His position with Leader was one of grudging subservience, although he did become the dominant member when Leader temporarily lost his powers at the beginning of season two. From then on like [[MODOK]] in the ''[[Iron Man (TV series)|Iron Man]]'' animated series, he became the bumbling [[comic relief]] with a crush on [[She-Hulk]].

===Video games===
The Yuri Topolov version of Gargoyle appears in ''[[Lego Marvel's Avengers]]''.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}
