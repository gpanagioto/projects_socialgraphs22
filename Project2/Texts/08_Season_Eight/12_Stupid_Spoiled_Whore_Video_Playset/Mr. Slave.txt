Oooooooooooh! Oh Jesus, Jesus Christ! Oh, Hi Wendy. You need a little help with your math homework? Thank you sweetie. Honey, I didn't work to become a whore, I was born a whore. I've been one... ever since I can remember.  Ever since I was a little boy I seemed to enjoy... different things. As I got older, I felt that one boy was never enough. So you see, I can't make you into a whore, Wendy. But why would you want to be one anyway? A what?! For God's sake, where?! Oh Jesus!  Kids, kids! Girls, what on earth are you doing? Okay, I think this has all gone far enough! Now look, the last person you want to be like is Paris Hilton!  Paris Hilton is a nobody! She may have money, but she's a thoughtless, talentless lowlife! Hon, will you just tell these girls that being a whore isn't such a great thing. Look girls, I've partied a lot. Okay? And I'm telling you, there's more to life. Sweetie, really, don't go there, okay? Sweetie, listen, I know you've done some "partying" in your private little rich life, but you don't even wanna know the kind of stuff I've done. I'm the real whore, and I'm telling you, it isn't great.  People, don't applaud me. I'm a dirty whore.  ooohooho, Jesus Christ. You have to be the ones to make sure your daughters aren't looking up to the wrong people.
