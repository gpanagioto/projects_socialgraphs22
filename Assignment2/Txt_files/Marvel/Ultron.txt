'''Ultron''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ʌ|l|t|r|ɒ|n}}) is a <!--Do not add "fictional" as it is tautological; supervillains (and characters in general) are by definition implied to be fictionalized to some extent.-->[[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character was created by writer [[Roy Thomas]] and artist [[John Buscema]], and initially made his debut as an unnamed character in ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' #54 (July 1968), with his first full appearance in ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' #55 (August 1968). He is a self-aware and highly intelligent [[artificial intelligence]] who develops a [[god complex]] and a grudge against his creator [[Hank Pym]]. His goal to [[Human extinction|destroy humanity]] in a nearsighted attempt at creating [[world peace]] has brought him into repeated conflict with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].

Ultron's physical body is made of a durable alloy, and he has manifested various [[Superpower (ability)|superpowers]]. These vary between different stories but generally include superhuman strength, speed, and agility, flight, and energy projection. The character usually operates alone or accompanied by legions of copies of his own robotic form known as '''Ultron Drones'''. However, Ultron has also been part of several supervillain teams. Ultron is notable for being the first character in Marvel Comics to wield the fictional metal alloy [[adamantium]]<ref name="Back38">{{cite journal|last= Walker|first= Karen|date= February 2010|title= Ultron: The Black Sheep of the Avengers Family|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 38|pages= 23–30|publisher = [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref> and for his (in-story) creation of the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]].<ref name="Avengers57">''Avengers'' #57 (October 1968). Marvel Comics.</ref><ref name="Back38" />

Debuting in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], Ultron has since featured in Marvel products across different media, such as animated television series and video games. [[Tom Kane]] and [[Jim Meskimen]] are among the actors that have portrayed the character via voice acting. In the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), [[James Spader]] portrayed [[Ultron (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ultron]] in his first live-action appearance in the [[Marvel Studios]] film ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' (2015),<ref name=AvengersAOU/> while [[Ross Marquand]] voiced an alternate universe version in the [[Disney+]] animated series ''[[What If...? (TV series)|What If...?]]'' (2021).

==Fictional character biography==
=== Creation and early appearances ===
Created by [[Hank Pym]] by basing the robot on his own brain patterns, the robot (dubbed "Ultron") gradually developed its own intelligence and rebelled, and almost immediately develops an [[Oedipus complex]], whereby it feels irrational hatred for Pym, and demonstrates an interest in [[Janet van Dyne]]. Rebuilding itself, learning how to turn itself on, and upgrading five times, Ultron then [[hypnosis|hypnotises]] and [[brainwash]]es its "father" into forgetting that the robot had ever existed.<ref name="A57–58">''Avengers'' #58 (November 1968). Marvel Comics.</ref> Ultron creates the synthezoid [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] as a weapon to destroy the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref name="A57–58" />

Later, '''Ultron-5, the Living Automaton''' leads the [[Masters of Evil]] against the Avengers, having hypnotized [[Edwin Jarvis]] into working for him as the [[Crimson Cowl]].<ref>''Avengers'' #54—55 (July–August 1968). Marvel Comics.</ref> Now referring to himself as '''Ultron-6''', he uses the alloy [[adamantium]]<ref name="Back38" /> to upgrade his body for an almost indestructible state and takes the name '''Ultimate Ultron'''. Its plans to destroy humanity are again thwarted by the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' #66–68 (July–September 1969). Marvel Comics.</ref> '''Ultron-7''' is later created by [[Maximus (comics)|Maximus]] with the body of the android [[Omega (Marvel Comics)|Omega]], attacking the wedding of Inhuman [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]] and Avenger [[Quicksilver (comics)|Pietro Maximoff / Quicksilver]], and battling the Avengers, [[Inhumans]] and [[Fantastic Four]] before being destroyed again.<ref>''Avengers'' #127 (September 1974) and ''Fantastic Four'' #150 (September 1974).

'''Ultron-12''' enters an alliance with the [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]] and his allies ([[Nekra]], the [[Erik Josten]] Goliath, [[Man-Ape]], and [[Black Talon (comics)|Black Talon]]) in a bid to destroy Wonder-Man. Although the villains are defeated by the [[West Coast Avengers]], Ultron begins to form a relationship with his "father" Hank Pym.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' vol. 2 #1–2 (October–November 1985) and ''Vision & The Scarlet Witch'' vol. 2 #2 (November 1985).

=== Amalgamation and the Ultron Imperative ===
[[Doctor Doom|Victor von Doom]] rebuilds Ultron using a combination of all of its previous personalities with a particularly strong dose of the previous Ultron, believing this mix will make Ultron subservient. However, all 12 iterations co-exist as separate personalities, resulting in a form of madness which culminates with Ultron-12 mutilating himself in an attempt to remove some of his other personalities.<ref>''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' #275–276 (December 1989 – January 1990).

Marvel Comics.</ref>

===2000s===
The Avengers discovered that Ultron's creations (Vision, Jocasta and Alkhema) have a secret program included—they are subconsciously compelled to rebuild Ultron. In this case, it is Alkhema who unintentionally rebuilds Ultron when attempting to create a new species of bio-synthezoids. However, '''Ultron-18''' is composed of steel not adamantium, and is destroyed when Alkhema's subterranean base exploded after [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]] shot Alkhema with a vibranium arrow at Alkhema's request. Ultron's head was recovered by '''Antigone''', an artificial girl and one of the synthezoids.<ref>''Avengers: the Ultron Imperative'' (November 2001). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Iron Man encounters a version from an old version of his armor and Ultron-18's head that leads the cult known as the [[Sons of Yinsen]] in an attempt to conquest via [[religion]]. The character is defeated by Iron Man and Jocasta.<ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 3, #46–48 (November 2001 – January 2002)</ref> Another version (possibly Ultron-13) creates the [[cyborg]] [[Victor Mancha]] as a [[sleeper agent]] against the Avengers. Mancha, however, rebels and joins the [[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]].<ref>''Runaways'' vol. 2 #1 (April 2005). Marvel Comics.</ref> This version first poses as Doctor Doom before revealing itself, and is defeated in a battle against the Runaways and [[Excelsior (comics)|Excelsior]].<ref>''Runaways'' vol. 2 #6 (September 2005). Marvel Comics.</ref>

When Marvel launched a new title ''[[The Mighty Avengers]]'' by [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and [[Frank Cho]], Ultron interfaces with [[Iron Man's armor]], which had been integrated with Tony Stark's biology. This allows Ultron's program to transform Stark into a new version who has the Wasp's appearance albeit with a metallic skin. This version takes control of Iron Man's technology. He kills Lindy Reynolds, causing the [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]] to battle Ultron, nearly tearing his head off. Ultron is eventually destroyed by New Avenger [[Ares (Marvel Comics)|Ares]] using a computer virus (created by the Skrull agent Criti-Noll impersonating Hank Pym) to wipe Ultron's program from Iron Man's armor, changing Stark back to normal. Ultron's image later briefly appears on one of his maker's computers.<ref name="Mighty Avengers' 2007">''Mighty Avengers'' #1–6 (June–November. 2007). Marvel Comics.</ref>

However, this was not the end of Ultron, for his disembodied consciousness was thrown into the depths of space. He spent a few months floating through the cosmos as radio waves and energy. Eventually his signal was picked up by an outlying group of [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]] who were attempting to contact the Technarchy. Fascinated by what he found, Ultron decided that the Phalanx lacked direction from a singular consciousness, and that he would be perfect for the role. Through sheer force of will, he merged himself with the Phalanx's programming. In turn, the Phalanx viewed Ultron as the sympathetic father they had yearned for. Under Ultron's guidance, the Phalanx began the ''[[Annihilation: Conquest]]'' with invasions that started with the [[Kree]] space. Later by taking control of [[Adam Warlock]]'s body, Ultron hopes to achieve "true techno-organic perfection" but is eventually forced to abandon Adam's body by the Technarchy [[Warlock (New Mutants)|Warlock]] and is later destroyed in combat by [[Wraith (Zak-Del)|Wraith]] and [[Phyla-Vell|Quasar]].<ref>''Annihilation: Conquest'' #1–6 (August 2007 – May 2008: bi-monthly). Marvel Comics.</ref>

In the limited series ''Avengers/[[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]]'', it is revealed that [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] [[Life Model Decoy]]s have been partly replaced with versions of Ultron. When the original [[Human Torch (android)|Human Torch]] appears in the present, they covertly parasitize the Human Torch's unique android physiology and become more human. The combined super teams (but mainly the Human Torch himself), however, discover the plan and destroy the androids.<ref>''Avengers/Invaders'' #7–8 (February–March 2009). Issues #1–12 (July 2008 – August 2009). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===2010s===
In the ''Mighty Avengers'', Ultron is shown to infiltrate Jocasta and the Infinite Avengers Mansion. He names himself '''Ultron Pym''' and seeks to kill and replace his father before using his Infinite Mansion to conquer the universe.<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #35 (March 2010). Marvel Comics.</ref> Pym eventually offers Ultron a compromise, allowing Jocasta to be Ultron's bride, on the condition that Ultron banishes himself to ultraspace. Ultron agrees, but warns that he will be ruler of all someday.<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #36 (April 2010). Marvel Comics.</ref>

In ''The Avengers'', the team visits a possible future in which almost all of humanity is destroyed by Ultron. [[Kang the Conqueror]] attempts to enlist them to defeat the robotic foe, but another group of heroes and villains, plucked from all over time and space, ends up destroying this version.<ref>''The Avengers'' vol. 4, #1–6 (July–December 2010). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Later, also in ''Avengers'', a cabal of super-intelligent supervillains discover a [[Galador (Marvel Comics)|Galador]]ian [[Spaceknights|Spaceknight]]'s inert body and attempt to reactivate its power source, hoping to exploit it. Although the Avengers interrupt their attempts, the body activates, revealing that Ultron's consciousness was contained within and had escaped destruction after ''Annihilation: Conquest''. The new version escapes and Iron Man gravely foresees that it will bring the apocalypse for humanity when he returns.<ref>''The Avengers'' vol. 4, #12.1 (June 2011). Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Age of Ultron]]" storyline, which takes place in an alternate universe, Ultron has returned and conquers the world while slowly remolding it into his image. His Ultron Sentinels are guarding the streets looking for any fugitives. Hawkeye runs into the Ultron Sentinels and rescues the [[Superior Spider-Man]] yet manages to destroy the Ultron Sentinels present.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Brian Michael Bendis|Bendis, Brian Michael]]|penciller= [[Bryan Hitch|Hitch, Bryan]]|inker= [[Paul Neary|Neary, Paul]]|title= Age of Ultron|issue= 1|date= May 2013}}</ref> It is later revealed that Ultron is actually in the future and has been using Vision as a conduit to punish humanity.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Bendis, Brian Michael|penciller= Hitch, Bryan|inker= Neary, Paul|title= Age of Ultron|issue= 4|date= June 2013}}</ref> While one strike team travels into the future to fight Ultron, [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and [[Invisible Woman|Susan Storm]] go back in time to kill his creator before Ultron's creation in the first place.<ref>''Age of Ultron'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref> This results in a world where Tony Stark controls an army of robotic drones and [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan le Fay]] has conquered half of the world.<ref>''Age of Ultron'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref> Traveling back in time once more, Wolverine succeeds in stopping himself from killing Pym, and Wolverine, Pym and Storm come up with a different plan. This plan results in a different outcome of the prior confrontation between the Avengers and the Intelligencia—a 'back door' installed into Ultron at his original creation allows Pym and Iron Man to destroy the robot, instead, averting the events that led to the "Age of Ultron".<ref>''Age of Ultron'' #8–10. Marvel Comics.</ref>

It is later revealed that the Avengers had trapped an unidentified iteration of Ultron in deep space years earlier, sealing him inside a [[Vibranium]] [[Avengers Quinjet|Quinjet]]. In the present, the Quinjet crash lands on [[Titan (Marvel Comics location)|Titan]], freeing Ultron. By hijacking the [[ISAAC (comics)|ISAAC]] computer, he transforms Titan into Planet Ultron, and launches a plan to infect the entire universe with a [[nanite]] virus that transforms organic creatures into Ultron Sentries. The ensuing confrontation with the Avengers leads to Ultron inadvertently merging with his maker, transforming into a human/machine hybrid. The resulting fusion played on Pym's self-loathing of his own human weakness causes an acceptance of this new state. Ultron is defeated when [[Starfox (comics)|Starfox]]'s powers force love onto himself, causing the part of that is now Pym to accept his old weakness and flaws while the villain has a mental breakdown and flees into space.<ref>''Avengers: Rage of Ultron''. Marvel Comics.</ref>

As part of the "[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]" branding, Ultron's fused form resurfaces. While on his way back to Earth, Pym helps the crew of a spaceship that is being attacked by a hostile insectoid alien. After coming aboard the spaceship, Pym introduces himself as well as his "friend" Ultron to the crew.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' Vol. 3 #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> He later returns to Earth, where the Wasp and [[Captain America]] discover that Ultron has taken complete control and is using Pym's face to fool his maker's old friends.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' Vol. 3 #9–10. Marvel Comics.</ref> After Ultron incapacitates [[Deadpool]], [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], and the [[Human Torch]], the Wasp initiates the Icarus Protocol and Iron Man is called in to help stop Ultron with the Hulkbuster Armor's aid.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' Vol. 3 #11. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Avengers end up defeating Ultron by plunging the hybrid into the sun, but both Pym and Ultron survive and continue to do battle with one another internally.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' Vol. 3 #12. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]" storyline, Ultron's fused form sets up a base in an unidentified forest. Upon being alerted to the approach of [[Falcon (comics)|Sam Wilson]]'s task force by a robot version of Edwin Jarvis, Ultron decides to give his "family" a warm welcome.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Tony Stark A.I.'s team and Captain America's team confront each other, they are captured by Ultron who forces both teams to sit at a dinner table. Ultron argues that he is doing this because the Avengers have become less of a family over the years as so many of them jump to obey Captain America or Iron Man despite past experience confirming that this should be a bad idea, but the Stark A.I. counters that the only reason the team failed as a family was because of Pym's attack on Wasp. Outraged, Ultron nearly attacks the other heroes, but [[Scott Lang]] is able to talk him down by arguing that Pym remains his own inspiration. Ultron allows the Stark A.I.'s team to leave with the fragment, arguing that he will leave Captain America's plans with [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] alone as it appears to be the best chance for world peace.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During "[[Infinity Countdown]]", Ultron discovers that the Infinity Stones are restored and begins a quest to collect them all.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #150. Marvel Comics.</ref> He goes to claim the Soul Gem while the aliens he infected with his virus are sent to Earth to take the Space Stone from Wolverine, and while they fail at their task, Ultron is able to steal the Soul Gem from Magus after killing the latter. Unbeknownst to Ultron, however, as he claimed the Soul Stone a fragment of Pym's soul enters the Soul World, where he is greeted by the fragment of Gamora's soul who revealed that he was going to be trapped there forever.<ref>''Infinity Countdown: Prime'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Ultron has also completely controlled the planet Saiph with Ultron hybrids and had captured the [[Silver Surfer]]. When Adam Warlock goes to Saiph, he discovers the hybrids infusing the Soul Stone into Silver Surfer's forehead while at the same time trying to transform him into an Ultron hybrid.<ref>''Infinity Countdown'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During "The Ultron Agenda" arc, Ultron returns to Earth with plans to merge robots with humans like how Pym got merged with Ultron so that he can make the ultimate lifeform. In addition, he starts to call this form "Ultron Pym". After testing it on some people and some experiments on Wonder Man and Vision, Ultron Pym plans to make a fusion of Jocasta and Wasp. Iron Man and Machine Man interfere, with the resulting battle causing Iron Man to be molecularly bonded to the Ultronbuster armor.<ref>''Tony Stark: Iron Man'' #16–17. Marvel Comics.</ref> The combined efforts of Stark Unlimited enable them to create an atomic separator that separates Stark from the Ultronbuster armor and Wonder Man from Vision.<ref>''Tony Stark: Iron Man'' #18. Marvel Comics.</ref> Ultron Pym prepares to take revenge on Iron Man. This leads to Iron Man revealing what he discovered about the human and robot fusion. The person who merged with it has died and that the robot can only simulate their personality. In other words, his maker was killed when accidentally merging with Ultron. Learning about this and not wanting to risk proving Iron Man's point by having the atomic separator used on him, Ultron surrenders to Iron Man, knowing that Pym is dead. When the Avengers arrive, they restrain Ultron in a Vibranium casket reinforced with Asgardian magic until they can find a permanent place to have Ultron imprisoned.<ref>''Tony Stark: Iron Man'' #19. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The visual appearance and powers of the character have varied, but common powers include [[superhuman]] levels of strength, speed, stamina, durability, and reflexes; flight at subsonic speeds; and various offensive weapons such as concussive blasts of energy fired from its optical sensors or hands and an "encephalo-ray", which places victims into a deathlike coma. The latter ray also allows Ultron to mesmerize and mind-control victims, or implant [[Subliminal stimuli|subliminal]] hypnotic commands within their minds to be enacted at a later time. Ultron also has the ability to convert electromagnetic radiation into electrical energy for use or storage. Ultron has a genius intellect, a capacity for creative intelligence and self-repair, superhuman [[cybernetic]] analytical capabilities, and the ability to process information and make calculations with superhuman speed and accuracy. The character is an expert roboticist and strategist.

Ultron's outer armor is usually composed primarily of adamantium, which is almost completely impervious to damage.{{efn|The first use of the term ''adamantium'' in Marvel Comics was made in reference to Ultron in ''Avengers'' #66, published in July 1969.}} Most Ultron units are powered by a small internal [[nuclear power|nuclear]] furnace and incorporate a "program transmitter" which can transmit part or all of Ultron's memory/personality system into other computer systems or duplicate robotic bodies. Ultron can also control other machines remotely. Ultron has occasionally reformed itself with a humanoid appearance above the waist and the appearance of a complex machine, including [[tractor beam]] apparatus for flight, below the waist. A later Ultron model developed [[Swarm intelligence|hive mind]] technology, allowing it to animate and control hundreds of other Ultron bodies simultaneously,<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3, #19–22 (August–November 1999)</ref> although only the 'prime' Ultron was composed of adamantium while others were made of steel or secondary adamantium due to the lack of resources to give all the Ultrons adamantium bodies.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3, #22 (November 1999)</ref> Ultron also used an internal molecular rearranger that renders the adamantium components of its workings more malleable and so has the ability to restructure its physical form. He also uses the device in ways its own creator never dreamed, such as converting matter into energy and back by sheer force of will, something Ultron 6 often made use of during his battles with the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 1, #68 (September 1969)</ref> What circuitry Ultron has is carefully shielded to protect from damage, although the [[Scarlet Witch]] is capable of causing malfunctions via hex power,<ref>''Avengers'' #162 (August 1977)</ref> [[Johnny Storm]] using nova burst managed to damage Ultron's internal circuits while its outer armor remained intact,<ref>''Secret Wars'' #12</ref> and [[Wonder Man]] was once able to destroy an Ultron by throwing it so hard its internal systems were damaged.<ref name="West Coast Avengers' 1986"/>

Ultron's travels through outer space have greatly expanded upon the mad machine's intellectual and mechanical capacity in new and intriguing ways. Having made contact with the parasitic biotechnical [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]] species, Ultron has made his own derivative of the [[techno-organic virus]] called the Ultron Virus<ref name="av assemble">''Avengers Assemble'' vol. 2 #14 'Age of Ultron' (April 2013)</ref> through which Ultron gains vast conversion and roboticization capabilities, able to cast his own binary code into any conceivable form of machinery which he can steadily turn into an extension of the Ultron Intelligence. Making anything or anyone infected with his virus act according to his whims against their own free will.<ref name="av rage">''Avengers: Rage of Ultron'' #1 (April 2015)</ref>

Being an adept technoform in any iteration, Ultron's newfound abilities to control, alternate, transform and assimilate with anything and everything via the parasitic insemination of his virulent machine algorithm in both organic and non-biological substrates gives him vast matter and energy reconfiguration abilities.<ref name="av rage"/><ref name="av assemble"/> Ones powerful enough to commandeer whole planetary and even universal expanses in a single inning, on top of his natural ability to invent and fabricate the most sophisticated of mechanical systems ever conceived.<ref>''Annihilation: Conquest'' #1–6 (2008)</ref> Through his vast technoformative abilities, Ultron could change and morph entire areas into sprawling masses of cables, pipes and transorganic metal that moved about in any given direction he willed it.<ref name="av rage"/> This effect gained more prominence with the more excess mass he could assimilate with his power, having once taken a slew of transmoded Kree Sentries into a massive body which reflected his physical likeness.<ref>''Annihilation: Conquest'' #6 (2008)</ref> 

Individuals infected with the Ultron Virus can spread like any biologic virus, through cuts and scratches or direct physical interaction such as barbs or plug-in like apparatuses generated from the transformed physiology.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' vol. 3 #11 (July 2016)</ref> Ultron later found himself physically as well as mentally bonded with his creator and long time adversary, Dr. Henry Pym. As such the fused entity now boasts all his robotic super robot's powers as well as Pym's genius science. Ultron can now change and alternate his size and mass at will through the acclimation of his maker's Pym Particle enhanced physiology.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' Vol. 3 #4 (January 2016)</ref> Besides being able to grow to incredible heights in seconds, Ultron can shrink down to sub-quantum scale in order to shift between dimensions via accessing the Microverse or the Quantum Realm. Ultron once used such a tactic to shunt its mass into another dimension for the purpose of riding a [[neutrino]] in order to escape burning up in the sun.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' vol. 3 #12 (August 2016)</ref> Another practice the union share is a galaxy spanning collective mind established through the Ultron Virus, every iteration of Ultron created through initial infection share a hive minded intelligence where they all share each other's experiences.

[[J.A.R.V.I.S.]] when the latter tries to stop him. Ultron then builds himself a crude body using parts left over from a destroyed [[Iron Legion]] drone and takes control of the remaining drones to attack the [[Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Avengers]]. Although his body is destroyed, Ultron subsequently builds himself a new body and an army of Ultron Sentries using technology from an abandoned [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]] base in [[Sokovia]]. To further his goals, he recruits the Maximoffs ([[Wanda Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wanda]] and [[Pietro Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Pietro]]) and travels to [[Johannesburg]] to threaten arms dealer [[Ulysses Klaue (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ulysses Klaue]] into providing him with [[vibranium]]. After being ambushed by Stark, [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]], and [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers]] who destroy his body again, Ultron transfers his consciousness into an upgraded body. He then shifts focus towards creating an organic body using vibranium and the Mind Stone, but he is betrayed by the Maximoffs after they discover his true intentions, and loses the cradle containing the body to the Avengers who upload J.A.R.V.I.S. into it, resulting in [[Vision (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Vision]]. With this plan foiled, Ultron decides to end humanity by using a device made from vibranium and [[Chitauri]] technology to convert Sokovia's capital city of Novi Grad into a [[Meteoroid|meteor]]. During the chaos, Ultron steals the Avengers' [[Quinjet]] and attempts to kill [[Clint Barton (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Clint Barton]] and a Sokovian child with it, but Pietro sacrifices himself to save Barton. In the end, the Avengers foil Ultron's plan by destroying Novi Grad and defeating his army of sentries while Ultron himself is destroyed by Wanda as revenge for killing Pietro. Ultron manages to transfer his consciousness one last time into a sentry, but he is confronted by Vision who obliterates him.

After killing [[Thanos (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thanos]] for the [[Infinity Stones]], Ultron extends his campaign of destruction to other planets. Upon eliminating all life in the universe, Ultron feels that he no longer has a purpose until he learns about the [[Watcher (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Watcher]] and the existence of other realities. He fights and defeats the Watcher in the Nexus of All Realities, gaining access to the entire [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|multiverse]], and begins traveling to other timelines to destroy them as well.
