Whoa, boy, did you hear about that fire downtown, Sharon? It's just ridiculous to me that they didn't build fire escapes on those upper floors! Ridiculous! I mean, hello! Why yes, Stan. Captain Hindsight is our protector and guardian. We're just thankful he was there for that fire. And now we can all eat in peace.  What the hell is that?  Who put that there? I don't know. I can't. I don't know what happened to all my tools.
