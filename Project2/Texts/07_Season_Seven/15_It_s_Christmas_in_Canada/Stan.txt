Dude, I'm gonna tell my parents to get me that John Elway doll with the karate-chop action. Sure dude. Yeah, dude. What if we miss out on some great Christmas adventure? Dude, Cartman. Dude, we just can't up and go to Canada. Look, they're about to light the Christmas tree. Maybe you can get your brother back some other way.   Dad, don't get carried away. Whoa whoa, Cartman. Cartman, calm down! It's true, dude. Christmas is ruined. Oh all right, but we'd better not miss out on great Christmas adventures. No, you're both coming. Do you care about Christmas or not? What's going on?? Do something, Kyle!  You guys, I don't think we're in America anymore.  All right dude, let's get the hell out of here! I thought mounties were supposed to ride horses. Ah, we're just passing through to see the new Prime Minister. What? What?? But I thought there was one road in Canada.  Oh no! And... I'm not gonna have a Christmas adventure.  Oh my God, they've killed Kenny! What is that?
