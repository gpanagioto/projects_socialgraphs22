 Excuse me. Have you boys seen a leprechaun anywhere lately? Ooooo, then you did see him.  That's splendiferous! I want you to tell me everything he said. Where was he? What was he doing? Well of course they are. But just because they're imaginary doesn't mean they're not real. Haven't you boys ever used your imagination?  imagination. Still not convinced, eh? I tell you what, boys. What say we all take a ride on my... Imagination Flying Machine?  Hop aboard, kids. I have something to show you.  Ubeuh... uh... n... no? Oh- Ohhh. But my boy, we're already here. This... is Imaginationland.  Now, good news, everyone! These boys did see the leprechaun!   No! It's just a Care Bear!  They're going something to Rockety Rocket. The only reason they would-  Oh my God. They're gonna blow up the Barrier! The wall! The wall which separates the evil side of Imaginationland from the good side!  Don't you get it?! If the terrorists blow that barrier, all the most evil things ever imagined are gonna pour out and take over Imaginationland for good! YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING!! That was your plan to stop them?? That's fucking stupid!
