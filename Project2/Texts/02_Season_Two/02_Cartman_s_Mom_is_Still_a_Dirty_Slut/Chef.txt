Is everybody okay? That sounded like a gunshot! Is he ...dead?  He's still breathin'! He's not dead.  We've got to get him to the hospital. Come on, children! Don't let him bleed on my Meredith Baxter-Birney memorial towel. I actually was ''with'' Meredith Baxter-Birney in this very car. And afterwards we used that towel to...  Wait a minute. Why am I telling you this? ''What?'' We have to get to the hospital. Sorry, Stan. We just gotta drop Mephesto off and then we can get outta there, alright? Come on, children! We've gotta find a doctor!  Doctor! Doctor! We've got a shot cracker outside! Whoa! Wait a second. They've closed the pass?? What do you want me to do? I used to watch ''Quincy''. So how do we get to it? The power! You're at the hospital, Mr. Mephesto. You were shot. Now, we don't know who tried to shoot you, but-- Ooohhh. He went off looking for Mr. Kenny. What??? You mean, at the Drunken Barn Dance, when we all got together with her, ''she'' was a ''he''?!
