Hank Henshaw was an astronaut at [[NASA]] until a solar flare hit his space shuttle during an experiment in space, damaging the ship and the crew. Henshaw and the crew, including Henshaw's wife, found that their bodies had begun to mutate and, after returning to Earth, Henshaw's entire crew either perished or eventually committed suicide. After learning that [[Superman]] had thrown [[Eradicator (comics)|the Eradicator]] into the sun in a battle during the space shuttle experiment, Henshaw blamed Superman for the solar flare and the accident. Before his body completely disintegrated due to the radiation exposure, Henshaw was able to save his consciousness. Using NASA communications equipment, Henshaw beamed his mind into the birthing matrix which had carried Superman from [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]] to Earth as an infant. He created a small exploration craft from the birthing matrix and departed into outer space alone. Becoming increasingly mentally unstable, Henshaw used Superman's birthing matrix to create a body identical to Superman's, albeit with cybernetic parts.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |last2=Pasko |first2=Martin |title=The Essential Superman Encyclopedia |date=2010 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=978-0-345-50108-0 |pages=64–65}}</ref> He returned to Earth to kill Superman, only to discover that [[The Death of Superman|Superman had already died]] during Henshaw's absence. Following Superman's eventual resurrection, Henshaw would not only become a recurring adversary of Superman but of [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]] as well. Hank Henshaw became a member of the [[Sinestro Corps]] during the [[Sinestro Corps War]].

When the "Death of Superman" story arc happened in the comics, Maggs presented a very faithful, though much pared down, version of the tale which featured [[Stuart Milligan]] as Clark Kent/Superman, [[Lorelei King]] as Lois Lane, and [[William Hootkins]] as Lex Luthor. Versatile American actor [[Kerry Shale]] was cast both as the villainous Hank Henshaw and as [[Superboy]].

In conversation with [[Invisible Woman|Susan Richards]], Henshaw points out the "ironic" similarity between his origin and the FF's. The story concludes with Galactus blasting Henshaw with a ray that turns him into a simple metal rod in response to his pleas for perfection, after the discovery that Henshaw was responsible for Superman coming to the Marvel Universe after he planted faked evidence that Galactus was involved in Krypton's destruction (having previously encountered the [[Silver Surfer]] in ''Green Lantern/Silver Surfer: Unholy Alliances'', Henshaw had learned of Galactus and sought the enhanced power of becoming his herald).
* Hank Henshaw appeared in issue #19 of the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold (comics)|Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' comics. Batman had to work with the Green Lantern Corps to keep Hank Henshaw from killing Hal Jordan.<ref>''Batman: The Brave and the Bold'' #19</ref>
