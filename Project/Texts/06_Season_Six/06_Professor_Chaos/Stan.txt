 Butters, you just don't really fit in with us here. We think it's best for all of us if you look for friendship opportunities elsewhere. All right, so let's get started on who's gonna be the ''new'' person to take Kenny's place.  It was a really fun time. We rode all the rides and everyone got along great.  One thing for sure: picking our new friend isn't gonna be easy. All right, congratulations to those of you selected to stay. In the end, one of you will be the new Kenny.  Good luck. Okay, next?  Yeah, it's not bad. Next?  Shut up, fatass!  I like it.  Okay, let's try this.  Okay, so how do we all feel about Towelie as our new friend?   Oh, this is giving me a headache.  He's quiet and he takes direction well. Really the perfect friend. How about Token?  That's great. Suckup.
