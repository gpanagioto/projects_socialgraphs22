Sure thing, Phillip. Ah ha ha ha, you got me again!  Phillip, I've got good news, and bad news. The good news is, you have a clean bill of health. The bad news is, you have cancer. Yes. I'm afraid your ass is collapsing. Yes. See this X-ray?  That's your ass collapsing. ''Your ass'' is collapsing. No, it means that you won't be able to live anymore. We're doing an anal transplant. It's our only hope. ''I'' am, Phillip. ''I'' am. Just half my ass. Can you believe it, Phillip? Best friends, and now we're going to share the same ass. Oh, Phillip, I'm so glad everything turned out for the better.
