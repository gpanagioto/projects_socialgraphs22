Well, Stan, it's a very fragile issue. Sometimes, yes, but senior citizens have to be dealt with very gingerly, Stan. We can't just take their licenses away. Yes Dad. Yes I know.  Sharon, have you seen Dad? Oh.  Wait a minute. If all the seniors in town are at a meeting, that means that when the meeting gets out...  Oh My God! Get inside! Get inside!  Get off the streets! Get off the streets! Old people are driving!  Gerald! Where are the boys?! The boys, Gerald! Where are they?!    GET OFF... THE STREETS! GET OFF THE STREETS!  GET OFF... GET OFF THE STREET! -STREETS!! OFF- GAAAAAH!!  Get over there! Stay low!  Shhhh!  AWWWW!! RUN!  Get up the stairs! Up the stairs! Come on! Come on!!  In here!  Quiet! Keep quiet!  Just, keep your voices down. We'll stay the night in here. We'll stay the whole winter if we have to.  Awgh. Stan, it's not that simple! Just relax while I find the lights. Here we go.  Oh brother. Well, good job, dad! Look at you now! You just had to be so damn stubborn, didn't you?! We're not treating you like children, Dad. All right? Now I think you owe Mr. Police Officer an apology. Who needs to apologize, hm?  Who's the sorry-sorry? Well fine. I was gonna bail you out, but maybe you can just sit here for a bit and think about what you did! What the hell is going on?! Dad, what are you doing?? This is insane, Dad! You all need to stop right now before more people get hurt!  Stan! Boys! You're safe! They've tried to stop them, son, but... the seniors get up so early in the morning they... get everything done before everyone else is even awake!  Yes. And now seeing how early they get up, I don't see how anyone can stop them. Wait a minute. You boys! You get up almost as early as they do! You can fight them! No, son. We... like to sleep in. They're coming!! Get out of here before they see you! Run to the hills and find a way to fight them! Go!!  Boys, avenger me! AVENGE ME!! Whoa-ho-ho-ooh, what happened? Is it over? Well, I think he learned his lesson. Huh? Don't you feel silly now, Dad? I think somebody owes us all an apology. Yes he does. Huh? Well, I think this has been a real learning experience for the Marsh family. People died, but we all grew a little. Let's just go home.
