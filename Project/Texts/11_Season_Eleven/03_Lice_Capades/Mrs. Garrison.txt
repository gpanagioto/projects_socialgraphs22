All right, students, let's take our seats. Apparently we have a little problem here at the school which we need to talk about. No, I mean the problem of head lice.  There's been a lice breakout at a school in Denver, and we need to make sure nobody spreads it here. So today you're all going to the gymnasium to have your scalps examined. I'm sure this class is clean, but we're gonna be examined so that if anyone ''has'' the lice, we can stop it before it spreads.  Okay, kids, today we're going to review some Civil War history. Who can tell me what year the war started? With what? Y-yes, some lice was discovered and the proper action has been taken. Uh, yes. That doesn't matter, it's over. It's being kept confidential! There's a policy in the schools not to single out a kid who has lice, because of the embarrassment it can cause, okay?! The case is closed! Whoever had the lice, they're dead now! We're moving on to Civil War history.  Ulysses S. Grant- Yello? What? Who's going to get attacked? Who is this?!  Every single person in the class! The boys aaand the girls! Lice spreads fast, you dumb-asses!
