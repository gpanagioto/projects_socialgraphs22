Well, you boys must be pretty excited: Your first night of Scouts. Yeah. Both Kenny's dad and I were in Scouts for years. Alright, boys, we're gonna head to the bar. We'll be back to pick you up at nine. You're the new scout leader? He got to where he is by being a good scout; maybe we should just leave him alone. So he's a homosexual. So what? Aw, that's ridiculous. Come on, Stanley.  Come on, Stan.  What did you say?! You do not say "Big silly goose"! You call him an asshole like a normal kid! Stanley, you call your friend an asshole this instant! That's better. Nice to meet you.  Well, I guess we're off to the bar until nine, then. Wow, you sure whipped those kids into shape. You bet. See ya, Mr. Grazier.   Oh, no. Oh, God, they're actually pulling it off. Oh my God. Well, we've all learned an important lesson. That just because somebody's gay doesn't mean they're gonna molest children. Straight people do that too.
