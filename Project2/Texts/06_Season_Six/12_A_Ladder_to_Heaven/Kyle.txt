It was such a long time ago! Which one of us took it?! It was so long ago, I c- I can't remember. We ''know'' he's dead. We mean, where is his body?? Yeah. Closure. There's not gonna be any robot guards, retard! Just get Kenny!  Alright, we made it! Let him out, Cartman!  Is he in there? I ''knew'' Kenny couldn't fit in that tea pot!  Why would they play such a cruel joke on us? Goddamnit! There has to be a way!  A ladder to heaven.  We build it, climb up, and get our winning ticket back from that asshole Kenny. Oh good! Cartman's back from the junkyard. Cartman? Cartman?! Dude, what the hell's wrong with you?! Maybe you got brain cancer.  Man, I can't believe how much people want us to get our winning ticket back. Do you see anything? Grandma?? Huh?  What does me being a Jew have to do with anything?! Yes we do! Just not the Christian heaven!  Hey Kenny. You're too fat to be Kenny. What?? For God's sake, why?? Are you gonna burn me? Jesus Christ! You did, dude! You drank his whole body! Yeah. Good job, fatass!  What do you mean, fatass? Do you see anything? Kenny didn't have the ticket stub. It was in his room. So we got all our candy, and you can all go home. Yeah, but now we think maybe heaven isn't a place you can get to, maybe heaven is just an idea. A frame of mind or, or something gay like that. Maybe heaven... is this moment, right now. Well, I'm sure glad this is all over with. Let's go count our candy. Whoa.  Kenny, you in there? Stop him, Kenny!
