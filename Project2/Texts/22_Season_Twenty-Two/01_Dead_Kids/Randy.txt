 What happened at school today? Who shot up the schoo-  was it you? Did you get shot? Oh...  Well, what's this about failing a math quiz? I'm sorry, Sharon. I...  Hey, Sharon, ya... doin' okay? Uh huh, and... what else is goin' on?  I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Sharon. ...Hun, uh...  When was your last...? I mean, you know how sometimes things can seem like a little bigger deal 'cause you know, your... down there? I mean, I'm just, I'm just pointing out that it is around that time. Okay. Okay, love you, honey. I'll leave you alone.  I agree with my wife. ...Anybody need a drink?  Everything's going fine, and then at a certain time of the month I have to start walking on eggshells. It's just. it's just once I'd like her to acknowledge it, you know? Just once say "You know, maybe I was overreacting a little bit 'cause of my hormones."  Okay, Sharon. Cool. Nuh-nothing. I love you, sweetheart. I don't know. I don't know how much more of this I can take. It's like, I turn on the TV and dread they'll say something about a school shooting because it's gonna set my wife off.  What... what do you mean? Menopause? I don't even know what that is. Uh huh. But... if a woman isn't having periods anymore, then why would she still overreact and be bitchy? Well wait, you're saying this could actually get worse?  Oh my God! How long does it last? You... you got your period? You just got your period this morning? Soooo the past few days, maybe you have been just a liiittle- Aw guys, uh she didn't mean it! She just... get, give her a...  Sure, honey. I know, sweetheart, I know.  Aaaaah? Aaah? Aaaaah? Aaaah. Aaaaaah.  What is it? Shuh-should we get down there?
