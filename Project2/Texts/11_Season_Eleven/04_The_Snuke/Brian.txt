Ms. Clinton, we just received word of a possible terrorist attack on your rally today. We aren't sure, but... perhaps it's best we call it off.  Otis Green, anything on that bomb threat?  What?!  Oh my God! Where?! Where could they have stashed it?! My God, they hid it under the stage?! Security measure, Mrs. Clinton. Probably nothing.  Yes. A what?! No, I mean what kind of nuclear device?! Ms. Clinton, it appears that terrorists have snuck a snuke up your snizz. What do we do? Can we disable the timer? But then that means... You're doing great, Ms. Clinton. They'll find the detonator, Hildog.  I'll do it! I'll check out Ms. Clinton's snizz.  All right. I'm nearing her snizz now. It's dark... cold... Uh, uh, all right, I'm looking. Yes, I see... I see the device!  There's um, metal housing... some kind of three-pronged triggering mechanism that... Wait there's... there's something else here! There's something...   There's something perched on the snuke's coil... Oh God, it's looking at me! Wha... what are you?! I have no qualm with you! Stay back! Stay back I- agh! Aaagh! It's... eating my head! It's eating my head!
