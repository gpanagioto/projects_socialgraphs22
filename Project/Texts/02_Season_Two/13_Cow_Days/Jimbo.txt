This year is a very special Cow Days because we are revealing our all-new Cow Memorial! Which will live forever in South Park from this day forward. Release the curtain!  Okay, everybody! It's time for the Running of the Cows! Okay, everybody, okay. Settle down. Now I know you're all anxious to get to the Running of the Cows, BUT, let me remind you: those brave souls who have decided to run against the cows through town do so at their own risk. I don't think I have to remind you that three people died in last year's Running of the Cows. With that said, let's rock and roll! Everybody ready to run? Release the cows! They're loose!  Yeehaw! All right, damn it! We're not going to stand for this! Now, whoever stole our golden cow memorial, we're gonna find you and kill you! Aall right, uhow about this? Whoever took the sacred cow, just please return 'im, and there'll be no questions asked. Wait a minute. You folks from out of town. You're the only ones with a reason to take our beloved cow memorial! Okay, that's enough-a that! You cows need to dis-perse! All right, bad cows! Do you hear me? Bad cows! All right, Ned. You're gonna have to bust out the whip! Holy crow! Play dead, Ned! You hear that, cows? You're surrounded! There's no way out! Hey. Where's she going? That's the wrong way, you stupid cow! Nnoo! They're killing themselves! Stop! Please! Can't we do anything?! Oh, God, the humanity, Ned! The humanity! Yeah. They're dead, mayor. They're all dead.  Oho, it was awful!  Cow after cow taking its own life, and we could do nothing to stop them! Oh, God!  I hope so, Mayor. I hope so. God I need a cold beer and a burger. What's all the ruckus over there? Oh, hell, I have to run home and get my broom! Hey, aren't those the people we at first thought took the wooden cow? Aw, I forgot all about 'em.
