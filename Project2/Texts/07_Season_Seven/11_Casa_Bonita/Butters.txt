But what about everyone else? I have to tell my parents so they can come here, too. Are you sure? But I'm the only one down here. What am I supposed to repopulate with?  Oh God, oh God!  Hello??  Hwaaaah!! Wuh, wait, well, what happened?? What about my parents. Did you see them?  Oh my God, let me see!  How many survivors are there? You should all come down here. Wow...

Eh,<br>Oo-oo-ooooo-oo girl. [the shelter lid opens again]'' Eric?  Eric, is that you? Who's coming this way? Oh God! I hate cannibals! Noooo! But I can't see nothin'. Are we out in the destruction?

[hums a bit; the worker arrives to see him sweeping] Woo-oo-ooooo-oo-oo, I just had to find my say to you tan...''  HAAAAGH! Who are you? Are you infected? You're not a cannibal, are you? Oh.  Oh good. You're a survivor, like me. Look, Mr. Dog, another survivor. And it's a lady, too. That means we ''can'' repopulate the earth. Yippee! I'm rebuilding society. Here, take a look.  I'm ready whenever you are. Hey, that's not very nice! This is my first society! I'm doin' my best!  Ma'am, can I use your phone?
