'''Ultra-Man''' ('''Gary Concord''') is the name of two fictional [[comic-book]] [[superheroes]], father and son, that [[first appeared]] during the 1940s, the period fans and historians call the [[Golden Age of comic books]]. Both were characters of [[All-American Publications]], which merged, in 1946, with [[DC Comics]]-predecessor [[National Periodical Publications]].

They are separate from the [[DC Universe]] character [[Ultraman (DC Comics)|Ultraman]].

==Fictional character biographies==
Gary Concord Sr., a 20th-century scientist, had devoted his life to finding the means to end war. In 1950, an accident put him into suspended animation.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Nevins |first1=Jess |title=Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes |date=2013 |publisher=High Rock Press |isbn=978-1-61318-023-5 |page=62}}</ref> He awoke as a chemically altered superhuman in the year 2174.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Markstein |first1=Don |website=Don Markstein's Toonopedia |access-date=2 April 2020  |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/ultraman.htm |title=Gary Concord, the Ultra-Man}}</ref> His son, Gary Concord Jr., is born in 2214 to the lifespan-lengthened Gary Sr. and wife Leandra – daughter of the tyrant Rebborizon, whom Gary Sr. defeated. Rebborizon eventually returned to kill his own daughter, however, prompting Gary Sr. to kill Rebborizon in return.

After Gary Sr. dies of natural causes in 2239, Gary Jr. succeeds him as both Ultra-Man and as High Moderator of the United States of North America, the country's chief executive.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Thomas |first1=Roy |title=The All-Star Companion: Vol 1 |date=2004 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=9781893905054 |page=15}}</ref> He battles the warlord Tor and other menaces, and is later put into suspended animation until the 100th century. An encounter with the superheroine [[XS (comics)|XS]] (Jenni Ognats) of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] inspires Ultra-Man to form his own such team with fellow heroes Avatar, Behemoth, and Metallica on the planet Almeer-5.

Years later, Gary Jr. would appear in [[Grant Morrison]]'s ''[[Multiversity]]'' series.  He is seen to currently inhabit an unnamed version of Earth, alongside other characters with variants of the word "ultra" in their names, including [[Ultra the Multi-Alien]] and [[Ultraa]].
