'''Doctor Mid-Nite''' or '''Doctor Midnight''' is the name of multiple fictional [[superhero]]es in [[DC Comics]].<ref name=Guide>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide pto the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=92}}</ref> The figure has been represented in the comics by three different individuals, [[Charles McNider]], [[Beth Chapel]], and [[Doctor Mid-Nite (Pieter Cross)|Pieter Anton Cross]]. Dr. Mid-Nite was originally created by writer Charles Reizenstein and artist Stanley Josephs Aschmeier in 1941. The hero, represented first by Charles McNider, appeared for the first time in ''[[All-American Comics]]'' #25 (April 1941).<ref name="dc-ency">{{Citation | last = Greenberger | first = Robert | author-link = Robert Greenberger | contribution = Doctor Mid-Nite I & II | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | page = 104  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = New York  | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-7566-4119-1 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref> He continued in ''All-American Comics'' until issue #102 (Oct 1948).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Benton |first1=Mike |title=Superhero Comics of the Golden Age: The Illustrated History |date=1992 |publisher=Taylor Publishing Company |location=Dallas |isbn=0-87833-808-X |url=https://archive.org/details/superherocomicso0000bent/page/146 |access-date=8 April 2020 |page=147}}</ref>

Like many [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] heroic characters, the original Doctor Mid-Nite appeared as a member of DC's [[Justice Society of America]]. His two successors were also represented as members of the group or an offshoot. Doctor Mid-Nite has never appeared as the solo [[protagonist]] of a regular title magazine, but the figure has been the subject of an [[anthology]] and a mini-series.

All three versions of Doctor Mid-Nite have exhibited the same basic features: a cowled costume featuring a crescent moon symbol, keen ability to see in the darkness at the cost of near or total blindness in sunlight, the use of special visors and “blackout” smoke bombs to gain tactical advantage in combat, a high degree of skill in martial arts, and jobs as physicians serving both normal human beings and "[[metahuman]]" superheroes. Additionally, two of the doctors have been accompanied by sidekick owls.

As a blind character, Doctor Mid-Nite is widely regarded as the first superhero in comics to exhibit a physical impairment, pre-dating the creation of [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] of Marvel Comics by more than twenty years.

Charles McNider made his live-action debut in the [[Legends of Tomorrow (season 2)|second]] season of ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'' played by Kwesi Ameyaw. Charles McNider also appears in ''[[Stargirl (TV series)|Stargirl]]'', portrayed by [[Henry Thomas]] in season one and Alex Collins in season two, alongside Beth Chapel, portrayed by [[Anjelika Washington]].

==Fictional character biographies==
===Charles McNider===
{{Main|Charles McNider}}
'''Charles McNider''' is the original Doctor Mid-Nite appearing in ''[[All American Comics]]'' #25 (April 1941) in the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]] and is a common member of the [[Justice Society of America]].<ref name=Guide/> McNider, a young surgeon, was blinded when a grenade went off in front of him caused by gangster "Killer" Maroni, but he found that he could see in the dark. He made special goggles that allowed him to see in the daylight, and decided to use his special power to fight crime. In his civilian identity, he pretends to be a helpless blind man.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mitchell |first1=Kurt |last2=Thomas |first2=Roy |title=American Comic Book Chronicles: 1940-1944 |date=2019 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1605490892 |page=75}}</ref>

===Beth Chapel===
{{Main|Beth Chapel}}
As the aging McNider spent less time in action, '''Beth Chapel''', a medical doctor, stepped into the role of '''Doctor Midnight'''. She was an occasionally a member of [[Infinity, Inc]].<ref>''Infinity Inc.'' #21. DC Comics.</ref>

===Pieter Cross===
{{Main|Doctor Mid-Nite (Pieter Cross)}}
'''Pieter Cross''' first appeared in ''Doctor Mid-Nite'' #1. He is a doctor who develops the same abilities as Charles McNider after being drugged by enforcers from Praeda Industries and being in a car accident.

==Owls of Doctor Mid-Nite==
Both Charles McNider and Pieter Anton Cross train [[owl]]s as [[sidekick]]s.

McNider trains the same owl which crashes through his window, an event that leads to the discovery of his powers. This owl named "Hooty" (sometimes "Hootie") shares many adventures during the Golden Age.

Cross keeps company with an owl named "Charlie". The bird is named after the original Doctor Mid-Nite Charles McNider. Charlie keeps a mini-camera around his neck that can feed video directly to a display in Cross's goggles.

In 1965, DC Comics had no plans to revive Doctor Mid-Nite.

The story written by Norwood and illustrated by [[Steve Sabo (comics)|Steve Sabo]] features a doctor named Tom Benson who is blinded in battle. He discovers that his other senses are super-sensitive and dons the Doctor Midnite costume to fight crime.<ref>''Five'' #5</ref>{{Citation needed|date=May 2021}}

Another version of the character was shown in Dan Jolley and Tony Harris' ''[[JSA: The Liberty File]]'' as a World War II United States intelligence agent code-named '''the Owl'''. This character, though a playboy, resembles other Doctor Mid-Nite representations. Though derided for his dalliances with the ladies, McNider was trusted as a valued field operative.

In the ''[[Tangent Comics|Tangent]]: Superman's Reign'' series, a version of Doctor Mid-Nite his body completely covered by a black cloak is briefly seen.

In the new [[Earth-Two|Earth-2]] created in the wake of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' and [[52 (comics)|52]], a version of Beth Chapel is shown to be a member of the [[Justice Society|Justice Society Infinity]].<ref>''Justice Society of America Annual'' #1</ref>
