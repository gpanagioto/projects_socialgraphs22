 I wish I was doing better. Please Mayor, have a seat. We had a deal, Mayor. You told me this town would be the perfect place for one of our fulfillment centers.  It makes YOU look very bad. Perhaps... you should no longer be a Prime member. Then we have an understanding.  See how the worker begins to question his determination? Without his Amazon Prime Status, he fluctuates between being and non-being. Now... torn between memberships, the consumer-worker will reason that the strike is pointless. Prepare a bus. We must make sure that boxers who wish to box have a safe way into the fulfillment center. It is... not as I expected. Only one consumer worker broke through the picket lines. Your townspeople are more stubborn than I thought. Perhaps I should give up. How I long to return to Bezos and touch butts with my wife.  Amazon Fulfillment Center.  Yes, yes, the workers are striking. We're fucking working on it!  Is that so? Now those fools will pay!  Uh no, sorry, um... you say you have worker-consumers? willing to box? Very well. Stay right where you are.  You didn't tell me there was a bike parade. Everything is relevant when it comes to customers.
