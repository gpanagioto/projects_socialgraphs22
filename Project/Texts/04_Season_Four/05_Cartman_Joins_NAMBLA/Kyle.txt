Alright, Cartman. I'm gonna give you... a jail-time card.  You lose a turn. What? AIDS?!  What? You don't know what you're talking about, fatass! See? I ''told'' you, dude. Those are dialysis machines.  Old people have to hook themselves into it with a tube, and it sucks all their body fluids out. I know, hunh? Put your mouth against the glass like this.   Bleuh-leuh-leuh-leuh-leuh. We don't know what you're talking about, lardbutt. Wow. Your mom's pregnant, Kenny. What are you talking about, fatass? They are? We don't ''wanna'' go! We don't WANNA go! Yeah. I guess we gotta try to get into that club, too. Yeah.  HEY, WHEN ARE WE GONNA GET TO SOME ACTION, HUH? Dude. Being mature is ''boring''! I know, dude! Let's get the hell out of here!   Dude! We're surrounded by perverts. How? Dude. You have sex with children.  Dude. You have sex with children. Seriously. Well, Cartman? Don't you think you owe everyone an apology for bringing NAMBLA here?
