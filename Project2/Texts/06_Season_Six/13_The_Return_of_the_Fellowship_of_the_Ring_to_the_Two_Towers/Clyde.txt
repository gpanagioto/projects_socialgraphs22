What do you guys want? Oh. Okay, hang on a second.  What troubles you? So? I have three copies. And the DVD with twelve hours of extra footage. Very well, I shall call the council together. Meet me in the Woods of Gathering behind Talangar the Black's house. And don't let my mom see you, 'cause I'll get in trouble. Faragon, asshole!  And so that is the situation. The video may or may not have evil power. Kyle, would you bring it up here, please?  Look, until we see this tape's power for ourselves, we cannot risk giving it to anybody. That is true. Only a Paladin with a high constitution should watch the tape. Therefore, I think it is a job for you, Talangar the Black. What vice did you see on the videotape, Talangar? Is it the work of Sauron's magic?  One thing for sure, this tape cannot be trusted with anybody. It must be returned to the video store from whence it came. It is too far and too dangerous to go alone. Take with you the wizard . Very well. You shall be the Fellowship of ''The Lord of the Rings''. Good luck. I have to go home now before I get in trouble.
