==Publication history==
{{expand-section|date=December 2020}}
Vertigo first appeared in ''[[Marvel Fanfare]]'' #1 (March [[1982 in comics|1982]]), created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[Michael Golden (comics)|Michael Golden]].

==Fictional character biography==
In her first appearance, she was depicted as a member of the [[Savage Land Mutates]], empowered by [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]], with whom she first battled the [[X-Men]] and [[Spider-Man]].<ref>''Marvel Fanfare'' #1</ref>

===Marauders===
Later, although not a mutant, she joined the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]], a group of mutants working as assassins for the enigmatic [[geneticist]] known as [[Mister Sinister]].<ref>revealed in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #211</ref> Sinister wanted his assassins to destroy a large community of mutants, known as the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]], who lived under [[New York City]], as he had deemed them genetically useless. The Marauders did succeed in annihilating a large number of the underground mutants. While the Marauders were accomplishing this, they also clashed with the X-Men,<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #210–213 (Oct. 1986–Jan. 1987)</ref> [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]],<ref>''X-Factor'' #10 (Nov. 1986)</ref> [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]],<ref>''Thor'' #374 (Dec. 1986)</ref> and [[Power Pack]].<ref>''Power Pack'' #27 (Dec. 1986)</ref> With the Marauders, she also attempted to kill [[Madelyne Pryor]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #221 (Sept. 1987)</ref>

Sinister later sent Vertigo along with the other Marauders to fight the X-Men in New York City just before the extra-dimensional incursion known as the "[[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]]".<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #240 (Jan. 1989)</ref> She was apparently killed in battle with the X-Men.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #241 (Feb. 1989)</ref> Her alliance with Sinister was short-lived at that time, as she soon rejoined her Savage Land Mutate allies.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}

Said allies join with the more peaceful of the Land's inhabitants to resist a territorial grab by humanoid saurians. Her powers are central in defeating the enemy army. Various X-Men broker a peace agreement leaving the Mutates to their own devices again.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #457-459 (May–July 2005)</ref>

Vertigo and [[Sauron (comics)|Sauron]] encountered the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] in the Savage Land. Vertigo used her powers to render them all unconscious and they were all taken captive briefly, until S.H.I.E.L.D. comes to the rescue.<ref>''New Avengers'' Vol. 1 #5</ref>

===Marauders/Cloned===
Vertigo is a member of Mister Sinister's Marauders as well as living in the Savage Land.{{issue|date=November 2011}} As a Marauder, she has been killed and cloned various times.{{issue|date=November 2011}} It is unclear whether the Vertigo that appears in the Savage Land is another clone or indeed the original Vertigo, though it appears that the original Vertigo never left the Savage Land and does not have any ties with the Marauders.{{issue|date=November 2011}}

===Messiah Complex and Death===
Vertigo later reappears as a member of the reformed Marauders.<ref>''X-Men'' #200</ref>

During [[X-Men: Messiah Complex|Messiah Complex]], she aids the Marauders in search of the new mutant baby.<ref>''New X-Men'' vol. 2, #44 (Jan. 2008).</ref> During the Marauders' and the Acolytes' first battle with the X-Men in Alaska, she and Scrambler are taken out by Storm.{{Issue|date=February 2011}} After coming into a confrontation with [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] and finally getting her hands on the baby, she joins the others in the final fight between the X-Men and X-Factor and the Marauders and the Acolytes, only to be killed and eaten by [[Predator X (comics)|Predator X]], who was teleported in by the mutant [[Pixie (X-Men)|Pixie]].<ref>''New X-Men'' vol. 2, #46 (Mar. 2008).</ref>

A Vertigo clone appears in ''[[X-Force]]'' #9.<ref>''X-Force'' vol. 2, #9 (Jan. 2009).</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Vertigo is an artificially enhanced [[Savage Land Mutates|mutate]] possessing the ability to project waves of psionic energy into her environment which affect the nervous systems of other living beings, distorting their physical perceptions and sense of balance. This power induces effects ranging from mild disorientation and vertigo to unconsciousness. Vertigo can focus her power on one or more individuals, or project it outward from herself in all directions, affecting everyone within her range of influence.

Vertigo is not immune to her own powers, as she was thrown off balance when [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] reflected her psychic waves back at her with [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]].
