How do you know she's not? I mean, think about it: this is a guy who visits all our houses during the day, who ''clearly'' has a kind of... insatiable lust... I mean, somebody who would have sex with Kyle's mom would have sex with just about anything! Damn you, it's not just our wives anymore!  This morning, he came for me. I opened the door. It was the UPS man. He had a box from Amazon. I looked inside and found an adapter for an iPhone and then I remembered: ''I'' had ordered it! I ordered it the day before and I had barely any recollection. The UPS man is using his powers to try to have sex with ''me'' now. I know that what I feel for you is just some kind of spell. Just let me sign.  All right, he's coming to you. You should have never come to our town!  What?! How? Son of a bitch, it's him all right! He's stopping at another house.  Yes, we found that in his pocket.
