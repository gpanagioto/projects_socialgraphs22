===Joe Wade===
'''Joseph "Joe" Wade''' is the only character to operate as a villain under the Scarlet Spider alias. An undercover FBI agent, he's assigned to investigate the second [[Lady Octopus|Doctor Octopus]].<ref>''The Spectacular Scarlet Spider'' #1</ref> However, Doctor Octopus discovers Joe and traps his body in a virtual reality chamber before using his thoughts to power a hard-light holographic duplicate of the Scarlet Spider to tarnish the Scarlet Spider name.<ref>''Scarlet Spider'' #2</ref> Despite this, Joe is unable to stop himself from committing acts of violence. The true Scarlet Spider (Ben Reilly) attacks Doctor Octopus' lair, damaging the machine while Joe is still inside.<ref>''The Spectacular Scarlet Spider'' #2</ref> This turned Joe into a mechanized version of the Scarlet Spider with superhuman strength and speed, claws on his fingertips, the ability to fire webbing from his wrists, crawl up walls, and fire laser "stingers" from his eyes. After the imposter goes on a rampage, the second Spider-Man (Ben Reilly) joins forces with the [[New Warriors]] to stop the cybernetic Scarlet Spider before the FBI put him in custody so Joe can undergo medical treatment to remove the technology.<ref>''Web of Scarlet Spider'' #3</ref><ref>''The New Warriors'' #67</ref><ref>''Web of Scarlet Spider'' #4</ref>
