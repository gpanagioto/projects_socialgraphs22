Uh no, that-that's okay, Mr. Mackey. Uhhh, just uh ahh not right this second, Mr. Mackey. Uh...  Hey fellas. Oh I sure have. I've been working on my ruh... ruh... routine all year long. Well fellas, entertainment is my life. I love being in front of everyone.  Aaah! I gotta guh, I gotta go! See ya fellas.  Yeah. Yeah, I'm real excited. REAL excited... for some reason... Oh, Jesus! What's wrong with me? Fine, Mom.  What? Uh who told you that? Aw J-j-j-j...j-Jesus! Dz-n-Doctor Pal? Uh, sure? Well, a little, yes. But I have to make it stop! The talent show is this F-Friday. Ke...c-come again? N-no, I do NOT want to take off my shirt and kiss! Wow, what a what a great audience. So apparently Martha Stewart is out of jail. Have you have you heard about this, have you seen this? She's very excited to get started on her new show, "Martha Stewart Living, with an electronic ankle bracelet."  What a fantastic audience. Nuh uh! Wuh. Huh. Waaagh! Ungh!  Butters! Butters, ah I really need to talk to somebody, and I think maybe you're the only person who won't make f-f-fun of me. Butters, do you know what you're supposed to do when your penis gets hard? Really?? So, when your penis becomes hard, you're supposed to put it in a lady's vagina. And then it stops being hard? But where am I going to find a lady to stick my penis in? The talent show is this Friday. Hey Bertha. Well Bertha, I was wondering if I could stick my penis in your vagina? But the talent show is tomorrow!  Ooo! I'm trying to get laid. What's it look like? Wow, seems like you know a lot about this stuff, Eric. Have you gotten laid before? Well, wha-what do I do? Eric, I can't tell you why, but it's ''very'' important that I score to-night! Can you come on the date and help me? You're like a white... Hitch. Wow! Thanks, Eric. Hey Shauna. Wow, Shauna, you look f-fantastic. We're going to an authentic Italian restaurant, Buca de Fagghecini Uh, I think we're gonna try your authentic pizzareli casserona poppers. Wow, that is very interesting. Please tell me more. Wow, I've never thought of it that way before, but you're right. "If you're gonna be that way, I don't need to be your friend." Wow, how insightful. Really? Oh, I'm so glad you think so, Shauna, because I really wanna stick my penis in your vagina. But the talent show is tomorrow night!  Oh... Hi, Officer B b-b-buh b-b-buh b-Barbrady. I'm... not gonna perform in the talent show.  I just c-can't risk getting up in front of everyone. All right! I I keep getting an erection for no reason! Okay! But I can't get any of the girls here to let me... do it to them. Then why does God make it so that my penis gets hard if girls don't wanna have it in their vaginas? It's like a cruel joke. ...Colfax Point? Really? M-maybe I can catch the bus ...and get down there before the talent show ends. Th-thanks, Officer Barbrady!   Excuse me, ma'am. What's your name? Well, Nut Gobbler, I need to get laid. I have a raging hard-on that just won't quit, and the talent show has already started. No. Actually, I'm a stand-up comic. Sure do. Sure. I know the p-perfect place.  Hey, can it, jackass! I don't want her to know I was just here with a different girl. This is authentic Italian food straight from S-Sicily. You should try the Lotsa Mozzarella Pizza Roll. Oh, uh, wow, that is very interesting. Please tell me more. Wow. You know, I've never thought of it that way before, but you're right. If you're pissing blood, you can shove a tampon up your peehole. You are very insightful. Please tell me more. Well of course I wanna get laid. That's why I'm taking you to this ...fancy place and pretending to be interested in what you have to say. What? Fo-for real? Well jumpin' Jesus, what are we wasting our time here for then? The talent show is happening right now! Let's get to r-r-rammin'!  I beg to differ with you, sir. I paid for her and took her out to dinner. She's ''my'' ho! Yes, I do have a problem, as a matter of fact! I've spent all my money on this ho, and she's now my only shot at getting laid, and the talent show is only a couple of hours from being over. Sir, sir, that is ''my'' ho!  Sir, sir! Son of a ...b-bitch!  Sir! I paid for that lady, and by taking her, you are no better than a common th-thief! Nut Gobbler, grab onto my crutch!  I got you, Nut Gobbler!  Come on, ho!  Eugh! Stay on him! I'm not giving up!   How much do I owe you?  C-can I just get two back, please? Thank you.    I'm sorry I resorted to calling you jackass just now, but I'm very upset! What do I have? The weapon of comedy. So apparently the Chinese and the Japanese aren't getting along lately. Have you seen this? Have you heard about this? I'll tell you one thing: their food hasn't been getting along with my stomach for years. Martha Stewart is out of jail. Have you seen this? Have you heard about this? She's apparently gotten real good with baking cakes with keys in them.  Nice teamwork, Nut Gobbler. Not really. You're just a hooker, and I need to get laid. The talent show could be over any minute. Hold everything!  Mrs. Garrison, if you don't mind, I'll be taking that microphone.. Wow, what a terrific audience. So apparently it's been exactly two years since the fall of Baghdad. Have you seen this? Have you heard about this? Just as B-Bush predicted, Baghdad fell, Iraq fell, Saddam fell. The only thing that didn't fall was ...the price of gas.  You've gotta be kidding me.
