Doctor, we-uuuh purposefully sent our son to stay with a friend who had chickenpox so that he would get it early. Yeah, it's-it's true, he is. We're going down to-uhh Happy Burger for some milkshakes. See ya, son.  Doctor? Wh-where's Stan? Stan, our son? Will he be okay out of the hospital? Okay, well well, let's go look-- I'm-I'm sure he couldn't have gone far. Stan? Stan? Stanley, where the hell have you been?  Come on, we're taking you back to the hospital. What? Yeah. Isn't that great, Stanley? I can't believe you gave us herpes. You little rascals!
