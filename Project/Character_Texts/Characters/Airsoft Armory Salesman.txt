Uh, yes, sir. You see, you load these soft BBs into the guns and they just kinda sting. And you can put the soft BBs into grenades, rocket launchers, all kinds of stuff. Well, I wouldn't particularly say that…I mean – all the stuff is safe, the guns and grenades and things… but – but not necessarily the people who mostly play Airsoft… Teenagers.  How can I, uh… help you gentlemen? Uh… I think that's a somewhat foolhardy plan. Have you seen the kind of weaponry the teenagers buy? It's some of the biggest, nastiest weapons we sell. Yes, sir!
