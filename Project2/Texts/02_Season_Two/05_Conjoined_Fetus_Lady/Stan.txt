Yeah. Look, Pip, the rules are simple. A kid from that team is gonna try to bean a kid on our team in the head with a big red ball. If the ball hits you, you're out, but if you catch the ball, he's out, and the last team to still have anybody standing wins. Jordan, Swanson, pull forward! We need backup. We're losing men fast out here!  No, Cartman. Nobody ever has. Wa-was it wearing clothes? Oh, yeah. Eeww. AGGGGGGHHHHHH! No! I have to get it out! ARRRGGGGGGGHHHHHH!  Dude, I don't get it. Why are we playing dodgeball again? Aw, do we have to? Aren't we supposed to have won something in order to go to State Finals? Whoa, dude, this is a school?  Okay, what have you got? Sweet! A jelly roll is perfect! Places! Chef, we're hungry. But Chef, we don't wanna play the Chinese! Dude, Chef has lost it. Hey, isn't that kid Kevin Chinese? Tell us how the Chinese play dodgeball! You don't? Damn, dude. China's fucked up. Oh my God, they killed Kenny! Yeah, shut up, Pip.  Can we go home now? Dude, it's the freak nurse! Yeah, maybe that dead fetus makes her smarter.
