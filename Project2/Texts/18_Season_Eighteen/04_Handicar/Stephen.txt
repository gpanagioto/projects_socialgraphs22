 Well that was a lot of fun. Thanks for inviting us, guys. Oh nonono, we took a Handicar. It was easier that way. No, see, you just get the Handicar app. It uses GPS to locate where you are, and the Handicar comes and picks you up. Yeah, and it's cheaper than a taxi. I'm telling you, it's the future of transportation. Oh, here it comes.  Honey, our Handicar is here. Have fun drivin' home. I'll be relaxing on my iPad.  Download the app! It works great!  Timmy! Oh hi, Gerald, Sheila. You didn't know? Anyone can be a Handicar driver now. All you have to do is get your own wheelchair and you can earn a Handicap. I've had my Handicap for about three days now. Get on in.  Timmy! The world of transportation is really changing, Gerald. Don't you see what they're doing? This is just another example of corporations trying to keep down people with handicaps! Look, the point is that this is your opportunity to make Handicar- oops, sorry.
