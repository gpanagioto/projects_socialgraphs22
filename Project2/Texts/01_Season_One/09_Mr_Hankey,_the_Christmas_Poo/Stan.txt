Lights, please. Why are you Jewish on Christmas, Kyle? ''Christmas'' Poo? Whoa, Christmas snow! That was sick, dude! ...Nnnaw I think it's against the law, dude. Hey come on guys. We have to go to the mall and tell Santa Claus what we want for Christmas. We'll catch up with you later, Kyle. Wha-what is this about Christmas Poo, dude? See you around, dude. The whole town's pissed off at each other. It's really sweet. Yeah. You guys! I'm getting that John Elway football helmet for Christmas! 'Cause I looked in my parents' closet last night. What's that? What's in the box, dude?  Dude, sick!!! Kyle, I think you'd better get home and get some sleep. Hullo, we need to commit our friend, Kyle please. I wish Kyle was here. It just doesn't seem right without him. This sucks, dude. This is like the worst Christmas I have ever seen. We committed him. Huh?! O-oh. This is horrible! Everybody's fighting and my best friend is in an institution, all because we didn't believe in Mr. Hankey! I believe. Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here. You know, I learned something today. I learned that Jewish people are okay. And that...Hanukkah can be cool, too. Wh-what could it be?
