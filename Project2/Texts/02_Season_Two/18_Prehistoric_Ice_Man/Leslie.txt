Husband? You're not my husband.  Oh. It's my former husband, who I had forgotten all about. Yes, Lorry. Uh, larry. Larry-y, you disap-peared. I waited for you to come home for over three days! I. I remember how cold and lonely the nights got. By the fourth day I knew: I had to move on. We did, Larry. We looked all afternoon. But we found nothing, no trace. Leslie, I'm with Buck now.  Right. I'm with Buck now. We have children together.  Calvin is eight, and little Buck is 13. I just can't up and leave them. I'm sorry.
