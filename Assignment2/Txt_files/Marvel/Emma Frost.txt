'''Emma Grace Frost''' is a [[fiction]]al [[Character (arts)|character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]], most commonly in association with the [[X-Men]]. The character first appeared in ''[[The Uncanny X-Men]]'' #129 (Jan. 1980), and was created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist/co-writer [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=140}}</ref> Emma Frost, also known as the '''White Queen''', has evolved from a [[supervillain]] and foe of the X-Men, to becoming a [[superhero]], one of the X-Men's most central members and leaders. Following her introduction in 1980, Emma Frost has been described as one of Marvel's most notable and powerful female heroes.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Essential Emma Frost |url=https://www.marvel.com/articles/comics/the-essential-emma-frost |access-date=2022-08-21 |website=Marvel Entertainment |language=en}}</ref><ref name=":5">{{Cite web |last=Wheeler |first=rew |title=Mutant & Proud: Understanding The Queerness Of The X-Men |url=https://comicsalliance.com/mutant-proud-xmen-lgbt-rights-identity-queerness-transformation/ |access-date=2022-09-03 |website=ComicsAlliance |language=en}}</ref><ref name="Sheridan">{{Cite web |last=Sheridan |first=Brian |date=2021-02-06 |title=Emma Frost's 10 Greatest Displays Of Power, Ranked |url=https://www.cbr.com/emma-frost-greatest-power-displays-xmen/ |access-date=2022-09-03 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=":8" />

Frost belongs to a subspecies of humanity called [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]]s, born with superhuman abilities. She is an urbane [[Telepathy|telepath]] with a well-noted [[Deadpan|dry]] [[wit]].

The character appears in many adaptations of the X-Men properties, such as video games, animated programs, and she is portrayed by [[Tahyna Tozzi]] in the [[X-Men (film series)|live-action film]] ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]'' (as '''Emma Frost Silverfox'''), and by [[January Jones]] in ''[[X-Men: First Class]]''.

==Publication history==
From her initial appearance as the White Queen of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]], Frost appeared as an X-Men villain over the years. Emma Frost first appeared in the famous storyline "[[The Dark Phoenix Saga]]", in ''[[The Uncanny X-Men]]'' #129 (Jan. 1980). The character was created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist/co-writer [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]. Claremont was inspired to create the Hellfire Club after seeing the episode "[[A Touch of Brimstone]]" from the television show ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'',<ref name=xcompanion2>''X-Men Companion II''. 1982. Fantagraphics Books.</ref> where spy duo [[John Steed]] and [[Emma Peel]] infiltrate a criminal, hedonistic, underground society. Emma Frost was specifically inspired by Emma Peel, played by actress [[Diana Rigg]], who famously dons a provocative corset, collar, and boots and becomes the "Queen of Sin".<ref name="Knight2010">{{cite book|last=Knight|first=Gladys L.|title=Female Action Heroes: A Guide to Women in Comics, Video Games, Film, and Television|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0PKSFHwhTGYC&pg=PA119|access-date=13 April 2012|date=8 June 2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-37612-2|page=119}}</ref>

After The Dark Phoenix saga, Emma Frost frequently appeared in other storylines in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' and the original volume of the ''[[New Mutants]]'' alongside her [[Hellions (Marvel Comics)|Hellions]].

In March 1986, [[Tom DeFalco]], [[Mary Wilshire]], and [[Steve Leialoha]] were the creative team for the four issue ''[[Firestar (limited series)|Firestar]]'' miniseries, where Emma predominantly appeared alongside her Hellions. This series showcased Frost as the main villain as she attempted to turn [[Firestar (Marvel Comics)|Angelica Jones]] into her own personal weapon.

After recovering from a coma and aiming to redeem herself upon the knowledge that her Hellions had been slaughtered, Frost played a pivotal role in the [[Phalanx Covenant]], which saw her team up with [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]], and [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] in an attempt to save the next generation of mutants. This led to her becoming a main character of the spin-off series ''[[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]]'' which began in November 1994 under the creative eyes of [[Scott Lobdell]], [[Chris Bachalo]], and [[Mark Buckingham (comic book artist)|Mark Buckingham]]. The series ended after over 75 issues (and several one-shots and miniseries) with [[Brian Wood (illustrator)|Brian Wood]], [[Ron Lim]], Sandu Florea, and Randy Elliott ending the series. The series offered glimpses into her past before her days in the Hellfire Club, as well as introducing her sisters [[Adrienne Frost|Adrienne]] and Cordelia.

After the series ended and all the X-Titles were revamped, in 2001 Frost appeared in ''New X-Men'' as a teacher for the mutant population of [[Genosha]], which was then controlled by [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]]. After a [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] strike leveled the island nation, the X-Men found Frost amidst the rubble with a "[[secondary mutation]]" which hardened her skin to a [[diamond]]-like density. Using Frost as a character was suggested to writer Grant Morrison on his website by a fan. While Morrison initially had no plans to use her, the death of the character Colossus left Morrison with an opening.<ref>{{cite web | first=Brian | last=Cronin | url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2008/01/31/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-140/ | title=Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #140 | work=[[Comic Book Resources]] | date=January 31, 2008 | access-date=2008-05-28}}</ref> He created Emma's secondary mutation – a super strong diamond form – as a replacement for Colossus' powers and added her to the cast.<ref>{{cite web | first=Brian | last=Cronin | url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2008/01/17/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-138/ | title=Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #138 | work=Comic Book Resources | date=January 17, 2008 | access-date=2008-05-28}}</ref> Subsequently, Frost joined the X-Men. This would lead to her instigating an affair with fellow X-Man [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], who was having marital difficulties with [[Jean Grey]]. This series also provided further glimpses into her past, introducing her father Winston Frost and her brother Christian.

In August 2003, writer Karl Bollers penned an [[ongoing series]] showcasing her origins titled ''Emma Frost''. The series, which lasted for 18 issues, began during her days as a private school student and ended before her days as a Hellfire Club member. It expanded on the role of her father Winston and her brother Christian, also exploring the early days of her two sisters. Later Marvel issues would expand Emma's character history by depicting her as having past romantic histories with prominent Marvel characters, such as [[Iron Man]] and Prince [[Namor]].<ref name="CW3">''Civil War'' #3</ref><ref name="UXM AN DR">''Uncanny X-Men'' Annual – Dark Reign #2 (March 2009)</ref>

Under [[Joss Whedon]] and [[John Cassaday]], Emma was featured in the third volume of ''[[Astonishing X-Men]]''. She was a major character in the ongoing series, specifically during its third arc, "Torn," in which the authenticity of her allegiance to the X-Men was explored. She also frequently made guest appearances in other Marvel titles, ''[[New X-Men (2001 series)|New X-Men]]'' in particular.

===Background explored===
In a flashback story told by Frost in ''[[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]] #24'', Frost details a time she spent in a mental institution after being sent there by her parents. However, the short-lived ''Emma Frost'' series depicted Frost's early years differently, having her leave home and attend college. The series was supposed to cover Frost's life from high school until her first appearance as the White Queen, however, it was canceled at issue #18. ''Generation X #-1'' showed the first meeting of Emma Frost, Banshee, and the [[Dark Beast]], taking place after the events depicted in the ''Emma Frost'' series.

In ''[[X-Men: Deadly Genesis]]'', Frost is shown after the events of ''Generation X #-1'' working as a [[stripper]] at the Hellfire Club before rising to the rank of White Queen. Frost is approached by Professor X and [[Moira MacTaggert]] to join a new team of X-Men along with other characters introduced in the series. The task proves harder than first anticipated and Xavier is met with great resistance from Frost. The event is then mentally erased from everyone's minds by Xavier.

==Fictional character biography==

===Early life===
Emma Frost was born in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], to the wealthy Winston and Hazel Frost. She is the third of four children: her siblings are named Christian, [[Adrienne Frost|Adrienne]], and Cordelia. Winston is cold, ruthless, and domineering, often imposing impossibly high standards on his children, while Hazel abuses prescription drugs to cope with the tensions of her household. Emma obtains no emotional support from her parents or her sisters, but gets along with her brother Christian.

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:whitequeenbolton.png|thumb|180px|Frost in her original look as the White Queen of the Hellfire Club. Art by John Bolton.]] -->

===White Queen of the Hellfire Club===
As White Queen of the Hellfire Club, Frost held many titles, one of which was chairman of the board and CEO of Frost International, which helps to fund the activities of the Lords Cardinal. Frost also becomes the chairman of the board of trustees and headmistress of the [[Massachusetts Academy (comics)|Massachusetts Academy]], a school for mutants which serves as a counterpoint to Charles Xavier's [[X-Mansion|School for Gifted Youngsters]]. Frost and the club's agents later attempted to recruit [[Kitty Pryde]] for the Massachusetts Academy, and capture (and personally torture) several members of the [[X-Men]], including [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], and [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]]. Frost engages Phoenix in a psychic battle in which she is overpowered and on the verge of being killed. Frost launches a last-minute attack that led the X-Men to believe she had committed suicide,<ref name="UXM 129-131">''The Uncanny X-Men'' #129–131 (January – March 1980)</ref> though in truth, she was comatose and recovering from Phoenix's attack under the care of Sebastian Shaw.<ref name="NXM 131">''New X-Men'' #131</ref> In another encounter with the Hellfire Club, Frost telepathically forces [[Kitty Pryde]]'s parents to transfer her from Xavier's to the Massachusetts Academy.

Frost attempts to recruit several gifted youngsters to her cause: [[Firestar (Marvel Comics)|Firestar]],<ref>''Firestar'' #1–4</ref> [[Cypher (comics)|Doug Ramsey]] and again Kitty Pryde, all of which result in altercations.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #180</ref> Alongside the Hellions, Frost encounters the Hellions' rival team, Xavier's [[New Mutants]], several times.<ref>''The New Mutants'' #15–17</ref> When the New Mutants are later killed and resurrected by the [[Beyonder]], they are left traumatized and withdrawn. Frost offers her assistance in telepathically restoring them to their former selves. She then coerces their headmaster Magneto into allowing them to join the Massachusetts Academy.<ref>''The New Mutants'' #38–40</ref> With Shaw and [[Selene (comics)|Selene]], Frost invites Magneto to join the Hellfire Club{{nbsp}}...<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #210</ref> Alongside the Hellfire Club, Frost battles the [[High Evolutionary]]'s forces to rescue Magma,<ref>''The New Mutants'' Annual #4</ref> helps Magneto search for the New Mutants when they had gone missing, encounters the effects of the [[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]], and eventually forms an alliance with Selene and Magneto to oust Shaw from the inner circle.<ref>''The New Mutants'' #75</ref>

===Losing the Hellions===
When the time traveling mutant [[Trevor Fitzroy]] unleashes the mutant-hunting robots called the [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] on Frost and her Hellions, Frost places herself in a psychic coma in order to survive the ordeal. Her students however, are not as lucky and are killed by Fitzroy to fuel his time portals.<ref name="UXM 281">''The Uncanny X-Men'' #281 (October 1991)</ref><ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #282–284</ref> Frost later awakens in the Xavier Academy. Disoriented, she switches minds with [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] and, refusing to believe the X-Men when they tell her that the Hellions are dead, escapes. She is overcome with grief and guilt when she discovers that her students are indeed dead, and briefly becomes suicidal. Professor Xavier consoles Frost and is able to coax her to switch back.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #311–314</ref>

===Generation X===
Frost later teams up with the X-Men to defeat the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]], and in the process, rescue a select group of teenage mutants who become a superhero team known as [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]],<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #316–318. Marvel Comics.</ref> to whom Frost and Banshee become mentors at the reopened Massachusetts Academy. After Frost's business ventures take a bad turn, she seeks help from her estranged sister [[Adrienne Frost|Adrienne]], who is a [[Psychometry (paranormal)|psychometrist]].

===Joining and leading the X-Men===
In dealing with the emotional fallout from the murder of her sister, Frost travels to the mutant haven island of [[Genosha]], where she teaches at a mutant school until a genocidal [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] [[E Is For Extinction|attack]] kills most of the island's inhabitants; Frost survives due to the sudden manifestation of her [[secondary mutation]]: the power to [[Shapeshifting|transform]] herself into a flexible, near-invulnerable, diamond-like substance. After being rescued Frost joins the X-Men and takes on a teaching position at Xavier Institute.<ref name="NXMN1">''New X-Men'' #115–116</ref> She mentors a group of telepathic quintuplets, the [[Stepford Cuckoos]], who quickly become her prized pupils. Frost and the Cuckoos prove themselves when they help fight and defeat Charles Xavier's evil twin sister [[Cassandra Nova]].

She quickly develops feelings for him but Cyclops initially rejects her advances.<ref>''New X-Men'' #128. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''New X-Men'' #136. Marvel Comics.</ref>

As Scott confides more in Emma, the two engage in a psychic affair. While quelling a [[Riot at Xavier's|riot at the school]], one of the [[Stepford Cuckoos]], Sophie, is killed and the others reject Frost's mentorship, blaming her for the death. They attempt to get revenge by telepathically contacting Jean about Frost's and Cyclops' psychic affair.<ref>''New X-Men'' #138. Marvel Comics.</ref> In the [[Murder at the Mansion|aftermath of the riot]], Jean catches Frost and Summers in bed together in their minds. In a rage, Jean unleashes her reignited Phoenix powers and psychically humiliates Frost. Afterward, Frost is found physically shattered in her diamond form.<ref name="New X-Men #139"/> As [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] and [[Sage (comics)|Sage]] investigate the crime, Jean uses her increasingly growing Phoenix powers to reassemble Frost's body, acknowledging that Frost has genuinely fallen in love with Scott. Scott confronts Jean and demands that she read his mind; Jean finally complies, only to discover that Scott and Emma never engaged in any physical contact, though Emma had offered it. Revived, Frost is able to name her attempted murderer – Esme of the Stepford Cuckoos, who had mind-controlled fellow student [[Angel Salvadore]] into shooting Frost in her single flaw with a diamond bullet, under the direction of [[Xorn]].<ref>''New X-Men'' #141. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Scott is devastated by Jean's death, and considers leaving the X-Men once more. It was revealed in the "[[Here Comes Tomorrow]]" storyline that, had he done so, it would have led to an apocalyptic alternate future. To prevent this, a resurrected, future-version of Jean uses her powers as the White Phoenix of the Crown and telepathically reached through time to tell Cyclops it was ok to move on, declaring all she ever did was "die" on him and he deserved a chance to "live." Scott begins a real relationship with Emma, kissing her physically for the first time by Jean's grave. The new relationship between Emma and Scott leads to problems between them and the rest of the X-Men, all of whom believe that the pair are doing Jean's memory a disservice.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 2 #8, 10.

===Diamond form===
At the moment of the destruction of Genosha, Frost manifested a secondary mutation giving her the ability to transform her body into organic diamond.<ref name="New X-Men #139"/><ref>{{Cite web |last=Wood |first=Robert |date=2022-06-12 |title=X-Men Needs to Bring Back Emma Frost's Forgotten (But Perfect) Codename |url=https://screenrant.com/x-men-emma-frost-powers-superhero-mutant-name/ |access-date=2022-08-25 |website=ScreenRant |language=en-US}}</ref> In this form, Frost is translucent and retains mobility while being nearly invulnerable, and able to support incredible amounts of weight.

Emma's diamond body is virtually tireless, as she does not produce fatigue poisons and has no need for water or food.<ref name="X #150 V2">''X-Men'' #150 (February 2004)</ref> She is also numbed from emotion, pain and empathy, impervious to cold,<ref name="XU #42 V1">''[[X-Men Unlimited]]'' #42 (April 2003)</ref> and resistant to heat in this form.<ref name="X-Men: Phoenix - Warsong #3">''[[X-Men: Phoenix - Warsong]]'' #3 (January 2007)</ref><ref name="XPW #4">''X-Men: Phoenix – Warsong'' #4 (February 2007)</ref><ref name="X #156 V2">''X-Men'' #156 (June 2004)</ref> Furthermore, in this form she has no need to breathe.<ref>''Wolverine'' – The best there is #12 (December 2011)</ref> Despite this high level of invulnerability, her diamond form has a single molecular flaw, which, if exploited – such as being shot with a diamond bullet – can cause her body to shatter.<ref name="New X-Men #139"/>

In this diamond state, Frost is unable to access her psychic powers due to suppression by her diamond form's [[Adamantine lustre|adamantine luster]].<ref name="OHOTMU #4 (2008)">''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe IV'' (August 2008)</ref> As a result, Emma is also granted total telepathic immunity while in diamond form.<ref name="X-Men: Phoenix - Warsong #3"/><ref name="NXM #123">''[[New X-Men (2001 series)|New X-Men]]'' #123 (April 2002)</ref> Her diamond form is also stated to emit low-level [[ultraviolet light]], causing it to glow in darkness.<ref name="OHOTMU #4 (2008)"/>

Frost's diamond form also grants her superhuman strength. She has been shown to manhandle [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]],<ref name="UXM 499">''The Uncanny X-Men'' 499</ref> and has sent [[Lady Mastermind]] flying through a wall with a single punch.<ref name="UXM 500">''The Uncanny X-Men'' 510</ref>

===Innate traits and expertise===
Frost has a gifted intellect with college degrees in multiple fields, including a Bachelor of Science in education with a minor in Business Administration from the prominent Marvel Universe's Empire State University. A superb businesswoman, Emma Frost for many years was founder and CEO of Frost Enterprises, a major multinational conglomerate headquartered in New York City that rivaled Stark Enterprises and Worthington Industries and specialized in shipping, aerospace engineering and new technology R&D.

Frost is also a highly capable planner, an [[electronics]] expert, and can invent machines that grant various psionic abilities, such as "Multivac", a mutant locater capable of monitoring the psionic levels of mutants; the "Hallucinator" used to induce hypnotic hallucinations to brainwash others; the gun-like device that enabled her to exchange minds and powers with Storm; and the Mindtap mechanism which enhanced and enabled her Hellfire cohort [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]] to project his illusions directly into the mind of the Phoenix.<ref name="UXM 129-131"/><ref name="OHOTMU #4 (2008)"/><ref name="X-Men' 2007">''X-Men'' #201 (September 2007)</ref><ref>''[[X-Men: Deadly Genesis]]'' #2 (February 2005)</ref><ref>''Astonishing X-Men'' #22 (August 2007)</ref>

Frost is well versed in medical disciplines such as neurology, biochemistry, pathophysiology and genetics. This has allowed her to medically cure [[Polaris (Marvel Comics)|Polaris]] from an array of infectious diseases and examine [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]]'s brain physiology.<ref>''X-Men'' #179 (February 2006)</ref><ref>''X-Men'' #187 (August 2006)</ref> Additionally, Frost has also been shown to bootstrap her own brain chemistry to counter a neurotoxin.<ref name="X-Men' 2007"/>

===Telekinetic potential===
On occasion, it has been hinted that Frost is also a latent [[Psychokinesis|telekinetic]]. Jean Grey's displaced psyche was able to use Frost's brain to generate a telekinetic [[force shield|force field]] and fly.<ref name="UXM 282">''The Uncanny X-Men'' #282</ref> During the Onslaught Saga, Frost unwittingly levitated several kitchen utensils while having a bad dream.<ref name="Gen X #19">''Generation X'' #19 (September 1996)</ref> When the mutant [[Synch (comics)|Synch]] "synched" with Frost's powers, he was able to use them to levitate several objects and individuals in the room. This phenomenon is then referred to as telekinesis and credited to Frost's psi powers.<ref name="Gen X #40">''Generation X'' #40 (July 1998)</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=July 20, 2018 |title=THE TOP 10 MARVEL MUTANT TELEPATHS |url=https://www.sideshow.com/geek/top-10-marvel-mutant-telepaths |website=[[Sideshow Collectibles]]}}</ref>

Frost possesses vast wealth as the owner of several multibillion-dollar conglomerates; Frost International, Frost Enterprises and Meridian Enterprises.<ref name="Gen X #49">''Generation X'' #49 (March 1999)</ref><ref name="Gen X #75">''Generation X'' #75 (June 2001)</ref> Additionally, Frost has also made investments in oil companies, Stark Industries, Wakandan Airways, Ben Nishmura's gamma research, Reed Richards' patent for unstable molecules and Cummings Aeronautics helicarrier project.<ref name="Gen X #75"/><ref name="Gen X #-1">''Generation X'' #-1 (July 1997)</ref> Furthermore, as CEO of Frost International, Frost has access to various technologies either designed by herself,<ref name="OHOTMU #4 (2008)"/> or made through acquisitions of corporations such as LaNeige Industries which specialises in trans-dimensional travel and weaponry.<ref name="Gen X #43">''Generation X'' #43 (October 1998)</ref>

Frost's wealth and legal resources (Brooke & Webster esq plc)<ref name="XX Annual #1">''X-Treme X-Men'' Annual #1 (February 2002)</ref> affords her a degree of anonymity over the digital medium. This has been shown to extend to databases owned by the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]],<ref name="NM #40">''The New Mutants'' #40 (June 1986)</ref> and the Sentinel [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]].<ref name="Gen X #23">''Generation X'' #23 (January 1997)</ref> Furthermore, several injunctions have been in place to prevent any discussion or referencing of Frost or her moniker the "White Queen" on any public networks.<ref name="XX Annual #1"/>

As a member of the Phoenix Five, Frost at one point telepathically scanned every single superhuman and human mind on the planet digging for the darkest of secrets and information.<ref name="AvX #9">''Avengers vs. X-Men'' #9 (August 2012)</ref>

===Attire and paraphernalia===
Frost regards her revealing attire as battle armour which may give her a psychological edge against any opponent.<ref>''Classic X-Men'' #36 (June 1989)</ref> Additionally, Frost considers [[high-heeled footwear]] as vital to her attire,<ref name="AvX:C #3">''AvX:Consequences'' #3 (October 2012)</ref> and has demonstrated balance and proficiency with them in hand-to-hand combat.<ref name="W:TBTI #12">''Wolverine: The Best There Is'' #12 (December 2011)</ref> Frost has to maintain a careful balance between her fashion sensibilities and being on the battlefield as this has on one occasion hindered her mobility on mountainous terrain.<ref name="UXM #521">''The Uncanny X-Men'' #521 (April 2010)</ref>

==Reception==

=== Critical reception ===
Brian Sheridan of ''[[Comic Book Resources|CBR.com]]'' referred to Emma Frost as "one of Marvel's most powerful characters," writing, "A frequent member but occasional adversary of The X-Men, Emma Frost is one of the most iconic mutants in comic book history. A gifted telepath, she also possesses the ability to shapeshift into her signature Diamond Form, which grants her near invulnerability and superhuman strength. Considered an Omega-Level Threat, Emma's power puts her on the same field as Jean Greyand Hulk, even though she often goes underestimated. With her extensive career as both a villain and hero, Emma's had more than enough opportunities to display just how powerful she really is."<ref name="Sheridan"/> Peyton Hinckle of ''[[ComicsVerse]]'' wrote, "Ice Princess. Royal Bitch. The White Queen. She’s gone by a lot of names but, after stripping away the aliases, who is Emma Frost? Is she really the cold diamond we like to think of her as or is there a breathing body underneath the hardened exterior? Recent issues of ''[[X-Men Blue]]'' and ''[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]'' show Emma as delusional and emotional, which has some critics questioning her characterization. While a lot of readers might wish for Emma to be portrayed solely as the emotionless White Queen, there’s more to her than an icy demeanor. A traumatic past full of abuse and loss has made a relatable and realistic character who deserves to be understood completely. [...] In the meantime, Emma Frost’s characterization should express her struggle with the effects of trauma. She might not admit it herself, but even she has to show emotion occasionally. Her current characterization is sad, but that doesn’t make it wrong. Her character needed to go through this. After all, a breakdown is the first step in the healing process."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Hinckle |first=Peyton |title=Cut Diamond: Who’s the Real Emma Frost? |url=https://comicsverse.com/cut-diamond-real-emma-frost/ |website=[[ComicsVerse]]}}</ref> Emily Stachelczyk of ''[[Screen Rant]]'' called Emma Frost "the best anti-hero in the pantheon of [[Marvel Comics]]," saying, "There are several different types of anti-heroes, but there are none more opposite than Emma Frost and Deadpool. Deadpool is a wise-cracking mercenary who commits various morally gray actions, but with the intent of bettering society for his select favorite people. He struggles with his internal darkness, but at the end of the day it's almost always a guarantee that he will end up being heroic. Public perception also tends to be in Deadpool's favor as fans can be assured that while the means could be contentious, his motivation is sound. Meanwhile when Emma Frost is faced with a moral dilemma there is a much greater possibility that she will abandon heroics for villainy. She has always looked after herself and carefully manipulated the environment around her to her advantage. This potential to switch sides is why she's the superior Marvel anti-hero. Deadpool, while a good anti-hero, is not the best because his alignment is less suspect than Emma Frost's. Her jumbled history of villainy and heroism not only keeps fans guessing, but also embodies that balance anti-hero characters strive for. Deadpool, while impressive, does not carry Emma Frost's Machiavellian anti-hero status. It is never a guarantee that she will choose to be a hero in a moral dilemma, especially when considering that Deadpool does not always lack conventional heroic attributes when it comes down to the wire. Overall Emma Frost's journey with the X-Men and lapses into villainy solidifies what it means to be a Marvel anti-hero."<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-06-13 |title=Move Over Deadpool, the X-Men's Emma Frost is the Best Marvel Anti-Hero |url=https://screenrant.com/emma-frost-xmen-villain-anti-hero-deadpool-marvel/ |access-date=2022-08-08 |website=ScreenRant |language=en-US}}</ref> Chase Magnett of ''[[Comicbook.com]]'' asserted, "Even when you set aside Emma Frost's extensive history and her impressive powerset, she's still a Marvel character in desperate need of a solo series. That's because she's one of the most complex and interesting characters at the publisher today. Even in her earliest days as a villainous member of the Hellfire Club and leader of the Hellions, her motives were far more complicated than world domination. She is someone who has understood the multi-faceted nature of power and how it is essential in defining one's place in the world. Every action she takes, even the misguided ones, stems from relatable fears and concerns and a heart that's far greater than her early appearances revealed. Emma Frost has always been a character looking to make an impact and she has across the past 30 years of X-Men comics. No matter which sort of role she has played within that team's many configurations, she has always been big enough to push them in new and surprising directions. Over that time she has emerged as one of Marvel's most interesting characters and someone with a devoted readership. It's time to let Emma Frost shine on her own again, as she's a diamond without peer among the X-Men."<ref>{{Cite web |title=Why Emma Frost Needs a Solo Series |url=https://comicbook.com/marvel/news/emma-frost-x-men-solo-comic/ |access-date=2022-09-03 |website=Marvel |language=en}}</ref>

Andrew Wheeler of ''[[ComicsAlliance]]'' wrote, "Women's issues and LGBT issues are intimately aligned, because both present opposition to the notion of straight cis male supremacy. Women represent a challenge to conformity, which is why female heroes and icons tend to be more important than male heroes in all corners of the LGBT community. The X-Men include many of the best female heroes in comics. Characters like Storm, Emma Frost, Rogue, Kitty Pryde, and Mystique, frequently shatter old-fashioned ideas about sex and gender through their strength, independence, leadership, and self-possession."<ref name=":5" /> Chelsea Steiner of ''[[The Mary Sue]]'' asserted, "Emma Frost is such a compelling character because of her complexity and her unique qualities as a female character. She doesn’t care about her likeability, and possesses powers beyond her mutations. Frost is highly intelligent, witty, resourceful and very wealthy. She is Bruce Wayne with telepathic abilities. She’s James Bond with diamond skin. And unlike many female mutants, she is not ashamed or afraid of her own powers. She is a self-possessed and confident leader. After all, not many mutants would be just as comfortable leading the Hellfire Club as the do the X-Men. Frost is also in control of her sexuality, displaying sex positivity before the term even entered the lexicon. She’s romanced Cyclops, Tony Stark, and Namor, to name a few. This characteristic is a natural extension of Frost’s confidence and strong sense of self. She knows who she is and will not apologize for it. Her rich character history and skill set show that she could star in countless different films. She could headline an Atomic Blonde-style retro spy film. She could star in a violent revenge film based on the fallout from Genosha. Hell, I would even watch her in a superpowered reboot of The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie starring her and the Stepford Cuckoos. There is so much to explore with Emma Frost, a character who deserves her own damn franchise."<ref>{{Cite web |date=2019-01-12 |title=It's About Time: Give Emma Frost Her Own Damn X-Men Movie |url=https://www.themarysue.com/give-emma-frost-her-own-damn-movie/ |access-date=2022-09-03 |website=The Mary Sue |language=en}}</ref> Claire Napier of ''[[WomenWriteAboutComics]]'' said, "Amongst the X-Men is a villain-turned-teacher (turned heroine, though never nice); her name is Emma Frost. For most of her history, she’s worn all-white, though recently she turned to all-black. But just as often as she’s been monochromatic, she’s been clothed in outfits that are overtly sex-suggestive. Emma Frost is remarkable because nobody—fan nor creator nor Marvel management—will ever say, “No, you are wrong for thinking that this character has been designed to imply eroticism.” She’s not a perfect construct, but she’s something of a relief. At least, at last, we can talk about it. That’s probably why Grant Morrison put her front and centre in his New X-Men. In superhero comics—which he loves to remind us are about muscular men and large-breasted ladies in spandex and latex punching each other through walls—Emma Frost is established as a mouthpiece for those who would sit at the back, whispering, “Isn’t this all a bit rude? Where are everybody’s sexy bits?” Here they are! They’re on Emma. She is our erotic scapegoat."<ref>{{Cite web |date=2015-07-31 |title=Sequential Sartorial: Fetishists, Unlike Emma Frost, Understand Occasion |url=https://womenwriteaboutcomics.com/2015/07/sequential-sartorial-fetishists-unlike-emma-frost-understand-occasion/ |access-date=2022-09-03 |website=WWAC |language=en-US}}</ref> Abdul R. Siddiqui of ''[[Mic (media company)|Mic]]'' stated, "The first criticism made against comic books, possibly because it is the most blatant, is the portrayal of women. It is commonly believed that females in comic books are all depicted as incredibly attractive, with clothing and form that only men dream up, and demonstrate a fixation on physical attractiveness. Even if we overlook the fact a woman should not be treated as a blemish on womankind simply because of how she dresses, there is generally at least one person in everyone’s social circle so materialistically obsessed with their looks that everything from their clothing to their makeup is absolutely on target.  A good example in comics is Emma Frost, best depicted in ''Astonishing X-Men''. However, consider Frost’s tale and it becomes clear that the men are not chasing physical attractiveness but idealistic beauty. In the first issue, when both Wolverine and Cyclops fight over the deceased Jean Grey, Frost states, “superpowers, a scintillating wit and the best body money can buy…and I still rate below a corpse.” If we were to go the traditional anti-feminist route, the men would not respect a woman after death and would instead follow the most voluptuous. Yet, both men chase after the woman they fell in love with, who has an incredible hold on them, and ignore the physically attractive. The fact that both Jean Grey and Emma Frost are psychics with the ability to make others conform to their wishes, powers they more commonly use on men than women, further asserts that this is work in which men submit to women that stand for ideals beyond physical beauty, as Petrarch wrote about in his sonnets."<ref>{{Cite web |title=Comics Books Are Not Sexist, But They Are Not Feminist Either |url=https://www.mic.com/articles/12032/comics-books-are-not-sexist-but-they-are-not-feminist-either |access-date=2022-09-03 |website=Mic |language=en}}</ref>

Darren Franich of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' described Emma Frost as one of "the most famous characters in comic book history," asserting, "A cruel beauty who became an occasionally-heroic cruel beauty, Emma Frost deserves a high spot on this list just for being the most interesting corner of the most realistic romantic triangle in X-history. Demerits because, like several other characters, she has a completely explicable superpower (telepathy) and then also a completely different superpower that has nothing to do with her other superpower (turns into…diamonds?)."<ref name=":6" /> Jo-Anne Rowney of ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' referred to Emma Frost as one of the "best female superheroes of all time," saying, "Step aside for this iconic lady, not only a complicated ice queen and staple of the ''X-Men'' comics, but she's also just a straight up badass. Her fashion is always over the top, and makes a statement, but it's all part of her image. She may have only been in less than half of the [[X-Men (film series)|X-Men movies]] (shame on you guys), but she's flying the flag for female superheroes everywhere."<ref name=":8"/> Sara Century of ''[[Syfy]]'' stated, "Emma has most of the Marvel universe waiting on her call. In the end, much of Emma’s sex appeal is based in her directness, her ability to compromise in impossible situations, and her deep understanding of establishing consent and boundaries with her partners. Her ability to put herself in the mind of her lovers and fulfill what they need shows deeply felt altruism. Though Scott seems to be the only man she has genuinely loved, with all her partners she laid the groundwork for mutually beneficial relationships. Emma Frost is a beautiful, intelligent woman who helped lead the X-Men with the ruthless mind of a true businesswoman, but it’s her hidden compassion that informs much of her sexuality. That surprising potential for open, messy, life-changing love is one of the reasons she continues to fascinate readers to this day."<ref>{{Cite web |date=2019-04-25 |title=Emma Frost and sexual healing |url=https://www.syfy.com/syfy-wire/emma-frost-and-sexual-healing |access-date=2022-08-09 |website=SYFY Official Site |language=en-US}}</ref> Matthew Perpetua of ''[[BuzzFeed]]'' stated, "Emma Frost started off as a member of the sinister Hellfire Club, but eventually joined the X-Men as the headmistress of the school. She's reformed a bit, but her elitist, cynical attitude has been a corrupting influence on her romantic partner Cyclops, and by extension, the rest of the X-Men. Emma is rarely portrayed as a purely negative character – she's just as invested in the good of mutantkind as anyone in the X-Men, and she's ultimately ashamed of her pettiness and vanity."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Perpetua |first=Matthew |title=95 X-Men Members Ranked From Worst To Best |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/perpetua/94-x-men-members-ranked-from-worst-to-best |access-date=2022-08-21 |website=BuzzFeed |language=en}}</ref> Jesse Schedeen of ''[[IGN]]'' called Emma Frost one of "Marvel's femme fatales," saying, "Emma Frost is a mutant who isn't afraid to use her psychic powers to their fullest advantage. From the moment Emma fled her rich, boring family life, she became used to taking what she wanted. This led Emma to join the Inner Circle of the Hellfire Club, automatically making her an enemy of the X-Men. These days, Emma is making a concerted attempt at reform. She now serves with the X-Men and has even become headmistress of the Xavier Institute. She works to train a new generation of mutants to harness their powers and carry on the fight for mutant rights. Even still, not all the X-Men are willing to trust Emma, and they may be right to doubt her motives. Emma has recently sided with Norman Osborn when the latter created the Dark X-Men. Though Emma appears to simply be working against the enemy from the inside, it can be difficult to judge just what her goals are. Even if Emma ultimately sides with the X-Men, there will always be those who refuse to trust her."<ref name=":7">{{Cite web |last=Schedeen |first=Jesse |date=2009-09-04 |title=Marvel's Femme Fatales |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2009/09/04/marvels-femme-fatales |access-date=2022-08-09 |website=IGN |language=en}}</ref>

Matt Lune of ''[[CBR.com]]'' found that ''X-Men Black: Emma Frost'' #1 "brings Emma Frost back into the spotlight, and raises her power level higher than ever," asserting, "From Genosha to Scott Summers, Emma Frost has lost a lot, but the biggest thing she has lost is perhaps herself. Here, in this issue, she finds herself again, and in doing so, fans have rediscovered a newly refreshed and re-energized version of a beloved X-Men mainstay. It’s hard not to spoil anything about the end of this issue, but Emma’s decision regarding her new title is so perfectly relevant for 2018 in a way that doesn’t scream at you but is still so provocative, so exciting and so very Emma Frost."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Lune |first=Matt |date=2018-11-06 |title=X-Men Black: Emma Frost Pulls Off the Ultimate Power Move |url=https://www.cbr.com/x-men-black-emma-frost-review/ |access-date=2022-08-31 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref> Jamie Lovett of ''[[Comicbook.com]]'' gave ''X-Men Black: Emma Frost'' #1 a grade of 4 out of 5, writing, "Of all of the issues of X-Men Black, this Emma Frost issue does the most to progress its title character in a new and interesting direction. That's no small feat considering the moral morass that Emma was dropped into thanks to an unearned villain turn way back during IvX. Other writers have been quick to try to redeem her, but arguably too quick considering how drastic and vile her actions were. Luckily, Leah Williams seem to have a total and complete understanding of Emma's personality and values and knows exactly which way her moral compass should be pointing. Rather than try to redeem Emma or reduce her to a simple villain, Williams has Emma walk her own path, making use of her gifts in intelligent and subtle ways to position herself a major player in the mutant world. She's joined by Chris Bachalo, one of the all-time great X-Men artists, for this story. While Bachalo's signature sense of design and unorthodox framing techniques are intact, he has a small army of inkers and colorists assisting him. As a result, this isn't Bachalo's sharpest-looking work, and there are some inconsistencies within, but it is still some stellar-looking comics. It can not be emphasized enough how essential this issue is for anyone with a soft spot for Emma, and its plenty enjoyable for everyone else as well."<ref>{{Cite web |title=Comic Book Reviews for This Week: 10/31/2018 |url=https://comicbook.com/comics/news/marvel-dc-image-comic-reviews-245359/ |access-date=2022-08-31 |website=Comics |language=en}}</ref>

Mike Fugere of ''[[CBR.com]]'' called ''Giant Size X-Men: Jean Grey and Emma Frost'' #1 "another arcane, beautiful chapter to the Dawn of X era," writing, "''Giant-Size X-Men: Jean Grey and Emma Frost'' #1 is an obvious tribute to an issue of Grant Morrison and Frank Quitely's iconic run on ''New X-Men,'' but its tone is far less psychedelic and far more ethereal. There is a sense of peace throughout Storm's mind, despite the horrific revelation that's discovered by the end of the issue. How the various emotional avatars within our Omega-Level mutant's mind interact with Jean and Emma are probably the most compelling part of this issue from a storytelling standpoint. It does a wonderful job at expressing emotions that are not always openly expressed between characters with conflicting ideologies with humor and a wonderful sense of whimsy."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Fugere |first=Mike |date=2020-03-01 |title=REVIEW: Giant-Size X-Men: Jean Grey and Emma Frost Is Gorgeous and Ethereal |url=https://www.cbr.com/review-giant-size-x-men-jean-grey-emma-frost/ |access-date=2022-08-26 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref> Matthew Aguilar of ''[[Comicbook.com]]'' stated, "This story is a joy from beginning to end, but it also subtly hints at larger ramifications for not only Storm but every other mutant on the planet.

The two women discover that the Breakworld has predicted Phoenix will destroy their planet. Under the deception of the psychic remnant of Cassandra Nova, Emma extracts hidden vestiges of the Phoenix Force from the remaining Stepford Cuckoos, killing them and granting her the powers of the Phoenix so she may free Cassandra from her prison, no longer requiring Shadowcat. Emma kills Ord, destroys the Breakworld, and confronts the X-Men, killing Beast. Emma reveals her fear that Jean will proceed to take everything—including Scott—away from her now that she has returned. S.W.O.R.D. intercedes and intends to kill Emma for the destruction of the Breakworld. Jean realizes that it is actually Cassandra Nova controlling Emma. Scott manages to reach Emma with his love and she gains enough control to allow the X-Men a chance to kill her and stop Cassandra. Shadowcat pulls out Emma's heart, but is also killed when the Phoenix Force explodes from Emma's body.<ref>{{Cite comic | writer=McCann, Jim | penciller=Roberson, Ibraim | copencillers=David Yardin | title=What If?
