Children, children! To honor this special time of year we'll be doing a canned food drive. Does anybody know what a canned food drive is? Yes, Eric? Noo, that's a Caesarian Section Eric, but that's okay, remember, there are no stupid questions, just stupid people. A canned food drive is when we collect canned food for poor people who can't afford to eat on Thanksgiving. Exactly.  I don't know Eric, they just do. Now children, I want each of you to bring in one can of food. And later, the mayor of South Park will divide it up amongst Kenny's family and other poor people. Okay kids, that's enough Dickens for one day. Let's get on with our lesson, right Mr. Hat? What the hell is going on?! Well, you don't see that everyday. Children, children! I'm a little disappointed in your Thanksgiving spirit. Only a few cans have been donated to our canned food drive. And can't we do a little better than ... Creamed Corn ... uh ... Creamed Corn ... and ... Creamed Corn? Please bring in more diverse food children or else Kenny's family is going to have a pretty corny Thanksgiving. Corny...Gravy...Corny Thanksgiving, ''hoo.'' Hahhaa. Anyway children, I understand a few of you have brought in something special for show-and-tell. All right boys, show us what you've brought. Boys, what the hell are you doing?! This is horribly, horribly wrong. How did you ''get'' this child? The sports watch from the commercial? Boys, you're too young to take care of a child! I'm afraid I'm going to have to call the Red Cross and have him returned.
