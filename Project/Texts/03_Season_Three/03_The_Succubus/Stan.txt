Yeah. Usually when he ditches school, he still shows up for lunch.   Why do you have to see an eye doctor? Where's Chef? Why did Chef quit?  Could you just hand us some food please? Yeah, we gotta talk to Chef after school and get him to come back. Chef, what the hell are you doing? We almost starved to death at lunch today. But why? Why would you quit? So you made sweet love to her down by the fire. Talked?!  That's nice. Look Chef, Cartman's got this eye doctor, see, and he- Girlfriend?! What the hell is going on?! She's stealing Chef from us. Wait you guys.  ...Yeah, screw that bitch. Let's find out where he's working and go see him there tomorrow. We wanna talk to Chef. And a chef hat. Huh? Chef, you have to dump the bitch! But we don't like her. I don't know-uh. No reason I guess.  Dude! He bailed on us! Come on! We're going to his house!   You forgot! Oh no! No nononononono! Normally we go to Chef with our problems, but wuh we can't this time. What's a succubus? Yeah! Wow, you ''are'' smart, Mr. Garrison! Yeah! He's gonna be so thankful we told him.  Who are you? Chef, we have to talk to you! You're Chef's parents? No, that's okay. He wanted money? Uh, could you just tell Chef we were here?  Cartman, what the hell are you doing?! Damn, your eyes must really suck, Cartman. Well, we couldn't even talk to him. She's so evil. She has him totally kept away from us. We know what you are, lady! A demon from Hell sent to suck the life out of men! I guess. Jesus dude!  Excuse me!  Yeah! She's evil and wants to suck Chef's life out of him Chef, but- No! I'm not willing to give up! Chef wouldn't give up on us! Oh man! There's tons of stuff on succubuses, but nothing on how to ''stop'' them. Dude! Chef's wedding is in three hours. We've got that much time to find out how to destroy a Succubus. What the hell does ''that'' mean? Right. Yeah? Oh-hoho! That's it! We gotta learn that song backwards. We can't fall asleep. We gotta nail that song.  God-damnit! You can't fall asleep. There she is!   Bitch. Bitch. Bitch.  All right. Kyle and I are gonna take our positions up front.  Here it goes. Now, Cartman!  Come on Cartman! Oh my God! She killed Kenny!  We're sorry Chef, we had to do it!  We'd love them!
