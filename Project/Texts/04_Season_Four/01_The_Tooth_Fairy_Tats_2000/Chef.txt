Hello there, children. Oh. Well, uh, I'm afraid that the school charges extra for that.  Oh my God! There has got to be at least fifteen dollars here! Well! Look at you cute little crackers! With your money and your fancy clothes and your cell phones, it's almost like you were-  Oh my God, children! What have I told you about drugs?! That's right. And the only thing worse than doin' drugs is dealin' drugs! I'm gonna tell you about when ''I'' was your age and got offered drugs.  Uh? You're not? Oh, uh weh-ell, children, whatever you're doin', just remember this: havin' money may seem fun, but...  Ooh, uh-oh, never mind. ''Damn'', that little Amanda was fine! I'm gonna look her up.
