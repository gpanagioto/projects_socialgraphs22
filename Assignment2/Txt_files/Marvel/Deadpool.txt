'''Deadpool''' is an [[antihero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by writer [[Fabian Nicieza]] and artist/writer [[Rob Liefeld]], the character first appeared in ''[[New Mutants]]'' #98 ([[cover-date]]d Feb. 1991). Initially, Deadpool was depicted as a [[supervillain]] when he made his first appearance in ''The New Mutants'' and later in issues of ''[[X-Force (comic book)|X-Force]]'', but later evolved into his more recognizable [[antiheroic]] persona. Deadpool, whose real name is '''Wade Winston Wilson''', is a disfigured [[mercenary]] with the superhuman ability of regeneration and physical prowess. The character is known as the "Merc with a Mouth" because of his tendency to talk and joke constantly, including breaking the [[fourth wall]] for humorous effect and running gags.

The character's popularity has seen him featured in numerous forms of other media. In the 2004 series ''[[Cable & Deadpool]]'', he refers to his own scarred appearance as "[[Ryan Reynolds|Ryan Renolds]] [''sic''] crossed with a [[Shar Pei|Shar-Pei]]".<ref>''Cable & Deadpool'' #2, p. 13.

Liefeld's favorite comic title before ''[[X-Men]]'' was ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'', which featured weapons like [[Captain America's shield]], [[Mjolnir (comics)|Thor's hammer]] and [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]]'s bow and arrow. Because of this, he decided to give weapons to his new characters as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ca.complex.com/pop-culture/2016/02/deadpool-creator-rob-liefeld|title=The Mouth Behind the Merc|website=Complex}}</ref> Liefeld, also a fan of the ''[[Teen Titans]]'' comics, showed his new character to then-writer Fabian Nicieza. Upon seeing the costume and noting his characteristics (killer with super agility), Nicieza contacted Liefeld, saying "this is [[Deathstroke]] from Teen Titans". Nicieza gave Deadpool the real name of "Wade Wilson" as an inside-joke to being "related" to "Slade Wilson", Deathstroke.<ref name="ReferenceA">"Classic Marvel Figurine Collection" #56.</ref>

Other inspirations were [[Spider-Man]], [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and [[Snake Eyes (G.I. Joe)|Snake Eyes]]. Liefeld states: "Wolverine and Spider-Man were the two properties I was competing with at all times. I didn't have those, I didn't have access to those. I had to make my own Spider-Man and Wolverine. That's what [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] and Deadpool were meant to be, my own Spider-Man and my own Wolverine."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/markhughes/2016/02/12/interview-rob-liefeld-talks-deadpool-comics-cable-and-more/3/#18cf32d4c3ac|title=Interview: Rob Liefeld Talks 'Deadpool', Comics, Cable, and More|first=Mark|last=Hughes|website=[[Forbes]]}}</ref> "''G.I. Joe'' was my first obsession. Those were the toys in the sandbox with me, kung fu grip, eagle eye, I had them all. ''G.I. Joe'' is a world of characters that I have always aspired to participate in. Snake Eyes was a profound influence on my creating Deadpool."<ref>{{cite web|title=First Look at Rob Liefeld's 'Snake Eyes: Deadgame'|url=http://www.previewsworld.com/Article/240381-First-Look-at-Rob-Liefelds-Snake-Eyes-Deadgame|access-date=2020-06-23|website=[[Previews World]]}}</ref>

Both Deadpool and Cable were also meant to be tied into Wolverine's history already from the start, as Liefeld describes: "Wolverine was my guy. If I could tie anything into Wolverine, I was winning." Like Wolverine, Deadpool is (or is thought to be) Canadian.<ref>''Marvel NOW Deadpool'' #3.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.marvel.com/characters/deadpool-wade-wilson|title=Deadpool (Wade Wilson) &#124; Characters &#124; Marvel|website=Marvel Entertainment|access-date=December 21, 2021}}</ref> The original story had him joining the [[Weapon X]] program after being kicked out of the U.S. Army Special Forces and given an artificial healing factor based on Wolverine's thanks to Dr. [[Emrys Killebrew]], one of the head scientists.<ref>''Cable and Deadpool'' #39.</ref>

In his first appearance, Deadpool is hired by [[Genesis (Marvel Comics)|Tolliver]] to attack Cable and the [[New Mutants]]. After subsequently appearing in ''[[X-Force]]'' as a recurring character, Deadpool began making guest appearances in a number of different Marvel Comics titles such as ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'', ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'', and ''[[Heroes for Hire]]''. In 1993, the character received his own [[Limited series (comics)|miniseries]], titled ''The Circle Chase'', written by [[Fabian Nicieza]] and pencilled by [[Joe Madureira]]. It was a relative success and Deadpool starred in a second, self-titled miniseries written in 1994 by [[Mark Waid]], pencilled by [[Ian Churchill]], and inked by [[Jason Temujin Minor]] and Bud LaRosa. Waid later commented, "Frankly, if I'd known Deadpool was such a creep when I agreed to write the mini-series, I wouldn't have done it. Someone who hasn't paid for their crimes presents a problem for me."<ref>{{cite news | last = Shutt | first= Craig | date = August 1997 | title = Bad is Good | work = [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]] | issue = #72 | page = 39}}</ref>

In 1997, Deadpool was given his own ongoing title, initially written by [[Joe Kelly (comics)|Joe Kelly]], with then-newcomer [[Ed McGuinness]] as an artist. ''Deadpool'' became an action comedy parody of the cosmic drama, antihero-heavy comics of the time. The series firmly established his supporting cast, including his prisoner/den mother [[Blind Al]] and his best friend [[Weasel (Marvel Comics)|Weasel]]. The ongoing series gained [[cult following|cult popularity]] for its unorthodox main character, its balance of angst and pop culture slapstick and the character became less of a villain, though the element of his moral ambiguity remained. The writer Joe Kelly noted, "With Deadpool, we could do anything we wanted because everybody just expected the book to be canceled every five seconds, so nobody was paying attention. And we could get away with it."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/090716-JoeKellyDeadpool.html|title=2 Great Tastes That Taste Great Together: Joe Kelly/Deadpool|last= Rogers|first=Vaneta|date=July 16, 2009|publisher=Newsarama.com|access-date=August 12, 2009}}</ref> Reportedly Kelly introduced the [[fourth wall]] breaking gimmick.<ref name=acrithit>{{cite web|url=http://www.acriticalhit.com/you-dont-know-merc-a-history-of-deadpool/|title=You don't know merc: a history of Deadpool|first=Kate|last=Willaert|publisher=A Critical Hit|website=acriticalhit.com|date=July 8, 2013}}</ref>

The series was taken over by [[Christopher Priest (comics)|Christopher Priest]] who noted that he found Kelly's issues to be "complex and a little hostile to new readers like me" and that by issue 37, he realized that "it was okay to make Deadpool look stupid."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digital-priest.com/comics/deadpool.htm|title=adventures in the funnybook game – Deadpool|last=Priest|first=Christopher |date=September 2000|publisher=Christopher Priest official site|access-date=August 15, 2009}}</ref> Kelly may have introduced Deadpool to breaking the fourth wall, but Priest "could be credited for establishing it as an essential part of the character's personality and worldview." Priest left the series after only one year at issue #45.<ref name=acrithit/>

===2000s===
For a time, writers who followed generally ignored the fourth wall entirely, until [[Gail Simone]] took over with issue #65. Her version is remembered for the frequent use of the "little yellow boxes."<ref name=acrithit/> ''Deadpool'' lasted until issue #69, at which point it was relaunched as a new title with a similar character called ''[[Agent X (Marvel Comics)|Agent X]]'' in 2002. This occurred during a line-wide revamp of X-Men related comics, with ''[[Cable (comics)|Cable]]'' becoming ''[[Cable (comics)#New Mutants and X-Force|Soldier X]]'' and ''[[X-Force]]'' becoming ''[[X-Statix]]''. Simone notes that "When I took the Deadpool job, the revamp hadn't been planned, so it was a complete surprise. Thankfully, we heard about it in time to make adjustments to the early scripts."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicsbulletin.com/ambi/104611396520415.htm|title=The Gail Simone Dialogues|last=Thomas|first=Brandon|publisher=Silver Bullet Comics|access-date=August 12, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090827112755/http://www.comicsbulletin.com/ambi/104611396520415.htm|archive-date=August 27, 2009}}</ref> It appeared that Deadpool was killed in an explosion fighting the supervillain [[Black Swan (comics)|Black Swan]]. Deadpool's manager [[Sandi Brandenberg]] later founded Agency X with a mysterious man called Alex Hayden, who took the name dubbed [[Agent X (Marvel Comics)|Agent X]]. Deadpool later returned to the series. Simone left the title after seven issues due to creative differences with the series editor, but then returned to conclude with issues 13–15.<ref>{{cite podcast|url=http://wordballoon.blogspot.com/2008_10_01_archive.html|title=Gail Simone Has All the Answers |work=Word Balloon with John Siuntres|date=October 30, 2008|access-date=August 21, 2009}}</ref>{{better source needed|date=February 2016}}

Deadpool's next starring appearance came in 2004 with the launch of ''[[Cable & Deadpool]]'' written by [[Fabian Nicieza]], where Deadpool became partnered with his former enemy, [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], teaming up in various adventures. This title was cancelled with issue #50 and replaced by a new ''[[Cable (comics)#2008 ongoing|Cable]]'' series in March 2008.<ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/marvelnew/xmen/disassembled/X-Who.html BALTIMORE '07 – MARVEL REVEALS X-WHO???

A new ''Deadpool'' [[ongoing series]] written by Daniel Way with artist Paco Medina began as a ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' tie-in. In the first arc, the character is seen working with Nick Fury to steal data on how to kill the [[Skrull]] queen [[Veranke]].<ref name="NEWDeadpool">{{cite web|url=http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.3253.NYCC_~apos~08~colon~_Deadpool_Goes_Solo |title=NYCC '08: Deadpool Goes Solo |access-date=May 4, 2008 |format=news }}</ref><ref name="SeptRelease">{{Cite comic | Writer = Daniel Way | Artist = Steve Dillon | Story = The Deep End | Title = [[Wolverine: Origins]] | Volume =  | Issue = #25 | date = May 2008 | Publisher = Marvel | Page = 24 | Panel = 1 }}</ref> [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] steals the information that Deadpool had stolen from the Skrulls, and subsequent stories deal with the fallout from that. Writer [[Daniel Way]] explained, "the first thing Osborn does to try and take care of the situation is to bring in a hired gun to take Deadpool down, which would be Tiger-Shark. That would be the standard thing to do, but of course everything about Deadpool is non-standard. So it goes completely awry and Norman has to get more serious about things." The story also sees the return of [[Bob, Agent of HYDRA]]; "I don't want the book to become 'Deadpool and Friends' so characters will drift in and out, but Bob was someone I definitely wanted to bring in. It just had to be at the perfect moment and when I was putting this storyline together that moment presented itself." This all led directly to a confrontation with the new [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] in "Magnum Opus" which crossed over between ''Deadpool'' vol. 2 #8–9 and ''Thunderbolts'' #130–131.<ref>Richards, Dave (December 16, 2008).[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=19197 "Way Talks Deadpool & Thunderbolts, Bob"].

It features stories written by several authors, with the main feature written by the original ''Deadpool'' series writer Joe Kelly and drawn by Deadpool's creator Rob Liefeld. A third Deadpool ongoing series, ''Deadpool Team-Up'', launched in November 2009 (with issue numbers counting in reverse starting with issue #899), written by [[Fred Van Lente]], with art by Dalibor Talajic. This series features Deadpool teaming up with different heroes from the Marvel Universe in each issue, such as [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Dave |last=Richards |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=22984 |title=Van Lente Talks "Deadpool Team-Up" |website=Comic Book Resources |date=September 18, 2009 |access-date=May 26, 2010 }}</ref> Deadpool also joined the cast of the new ''[[Uncanny X-Force]]'' team.<ref>{{cite web|first=Shaun |last=Manning |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=22472 |title=CCC09: X-Men Panel |website=Comic Book Resources |date=August 9, 2009 }}</ref>

Deadpool vol. 2 was written by [[Daniel Way]] and drawn by [[Alé Garza]]. In the story arc "DEAD", Wade is "cured" of his healing ability and becomes mortal. As a side effect, he also has his old, unscarred face once again. Although he spent the majority of the story arc looking forward to dying, he suppresses his desires in order to protect his friend and [[sidekick]] [[Bob, Agent of Hydra|Hydra Bob]].<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Daniel Way|Way, Daniel|penciller = Alé Garza|inker = Sean Parsons|colorist = Dono Sánchez-Almara

After he loses his healing factor, Wilson claims he felt "more alive than ever."{{issue|date=December 2012}} However, after a harsh beating from Intelligencia, Wade realized that he had let his ability to heal compensate for skill so he decided to ask for help from [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]] in training.{{issue|date=December 2012}} Taskmaster asked Wilson to help him steal Pym Particles from S.H.I.E.L.D., but actually, he allowed Black Box to study Wade in order to prepare his vengeance against Wilson, even letting him know Deadpool lost his healing factor.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Wade managed to defeat Black Box, Black Tom and Black Swan, but in the process, his face was burned and disfigured again.{{issue|date=December 2012}} Former FBI agent Allison Kemp wanted to get revenge on Deadpool because of his involvement in an accident which left her in a wheelchair, and she called other enemies of Deadpool such as T-Ray and [[Slayback (comic strip character)|Slayback]] and trained them to kill Deadpool.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Daniel Way|penciller = Ale Garza|inker = Sean Parsons|colorist = Guru eFX|letterer = VC's Joe Sabino|editor = Jordan D.

As part of Marvel's [[Marvel NOW!]] initiative, a new ''Deadpool'' ongoing series was launched, written by [[Brian Posehn]] and Gerry Duggan and illustrated by [[Tony Moore (artist)|Tony Moore]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/story/19199/marvel_now_qa_deadpool|title=Marvel NOW!

Initially a secret, his bride was revealed in the webcomic ''Deadpool: The Gauntlet'' to be [[Shiklah|Shiklah, Queen of the Undead]]. Deadpool also discovers that he has a daughter by the name of Eleanor from a former flame of Deadpool named Carmelita.<ref name="Deadpool #19">''Deadpool'' #19. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the events of "[[Original Sin (comics)|Original Sin]]", it was revealed that Deadpool was tricked into killing his parents by a scientist known as Butler (who abducted Eleanor and gave her to his brother), however, Deadpool does not know about it.<ref>''Deadpool'' vol. 4 #32. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Much later, he clashed with [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]], believing the universe was telling the latter to defeat him. After several fights and getting torn to pieces, Deadpool bonds with four symbiotes: Riot, Phage, Lasher and Agony. Playing mind games, Deadpool tricked [[Shriek (comics)|Shriek]] by using his shapeshifting abilities to make her disoriented and having her flee. After the symbiotic Deadpool and Carnage fought again, Deadpool captures Shriek and forces her to impersonate himself, making it trick Carnage into almost killing her in the process. Feeling broken after a mental breakdown, Carnage allowed himself to be arrested and was placed in an unlocked cell. While sitting in the cell until he was his own self, Carnage swore vengeance on Deadpool. Deadpool, after defeating Carnage, gives the four symbiotes to a war dog who helped Deadpool fight Carnage to deliver them to the government.<ref>''Deadpool vs. Carnage'' #1–4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[AXIS (comics)|AXIS]]" storyline, Deadpool appears as a member of Magneto's unnamed supervillain group during the fight against [[Red Skull]]'s [[Onslaught (Marvel Comics)|Red Onslaught]] form.<ref>''Avengers & X-Men: AXIS'' #2.

Deadpool laments that the Secret Wars should have stayed an Avengers event, but then dies at peace, content that everybody else is dying with him.<ref>''Deadpool'' vol. 2 #45. Marvel Comics.</ref>

====All New, All Different Marvel====
Eight months after the events of ''Secret Wars'' and the restoration of Earth, Deadpool is seen working for [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]]. After stealing some potentially life-saving chemicals needed by an ailing [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], he is offered membership in the [[Avengers Unity Squad]].<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 6 #0</ref>

In the course of the following months, Deadpool's popularity skyrocketed after the mercenary Solo impersonated him to piggyback on Deadpool's reputation and take jobs at a higher pay rate. One of Solo's jobs in Washington, D.C. had Deadpool's public opinion drastically change for the better when he saved an ambassador from his telepathically manipulated agents. After learning of Solo's impersonation, Deadpool came up with the idea to form a group of mercenaries called the Mercs for Money to extend his reach across the globe. However, Deadpool's newfound popularity forced him to leave his family behind, fearing his enemies could endanger them. Deadpool additionally joined the Avengers Unity Division and used his popularity as a means of funding the team, with the profit from the merchandise.<ref>''Deadpool'' vol. 4 #1</ref>

Madcap additionally returned to Deadpool's life, though Wade was unaware his experience inside his mind left Madcap emotionally damaged and vengeful. Madcap initially posed as an ally, joining the Mercs for Money, but eventually showed his true intentions after he was discovered impersonating Deadpool to defame and threaten his loved ones. Seeing as he had had enough fun, Madcap used an alien weapon to molecularly disintegrate himself. For his second coming, the villain had Deadpool unwittingly become the carrier of a deadly airborne virus with which he infected his family. Wade found a cure, though had to resort to Cable's evil clone Stryfe to find it. Around this time, tensions between Shiklah's domain and the surface world sparked an invasion of Manhattan from Monster Metropolis, which in turn led to Shiklah divorcing Deadpool, opting to return to Dracula instead.<ref>''Deadpool'' vol. 4 #23–29</ref>

Not long after Wade joined the Avengers Unity Division, the real Steve Rogers was secretly supplanted by an evil fascist counterpart from another timeline that operated as a Hydra sleeper agent within the superhero community. When Phil Coulson became suspicious of Steve, Rogers convinced Deadpool to kill him, claiming that Coulson had gone rogue. A short time afterward, Captain America's machinations resulted in Hydra rising to power, taking over the United States of America. When Hydra's conquest had barely begun, Preston found out about Coulson's death and confronted Deadpool about it. The fight ended in Preston's death. As Hydra's empire grew stronger, Wade joined its own version of the Avengers out of blind loyalty for Captain America. Plagued by guilt, Wade held back when tasked with hunting down the rebel alliance known as the Underground and eventually helped, behind the scenes, to lay part of the foundation of Hydra's eventual defeat. With his mistakes costing the lives of two of his friends, the love of his daughter, and any respect the world had for him, Deadpool turned his back on what little remained of the life he had built.<ref>''Deadpool'' vol. 4 #31–36</ref>

In stories by writer [[Daniel Way]] between 2008 and 2012, Deadpool was, without explanation, shown to have developed a second "voice in his head," represented by a second set of captions with a different font; ''Deadpool'' vol. 3 Annual #1 (2014) would [[retcon|retroactively explain]] that this voice belonged to [[Madcap (comics)|Madcap]], a psychotic [[Captain America]] villain, who had become molecularly entangled with Deadpool.<ref>''Deadpool'' vol. 3 Annual #1 (2014).</ref>

Deadpool is depicted as having a regenerative healing factor, which not only prevents him from being permanently injured through enhanced cell regeneration throughout his body, but also causes psychosis and mental instability, as his [[neuron]]s are also affected by the accelerated regeneration. It is thought that while his psychosis is a handicap, it is also one of his assets as they make him an extremely unpredictable opponent.

Deadpool has sometimes been portrayed to have a strong sense of core morality. In ''[[Uncanny X-Force]]'', he storms out after [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] tries to rationalize [[Fantomex]] killing [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]], who was at the time in a child form. After Wolverine argues that Deadpool is motivated solely by money, [[Warren Worthington III|Archangel]] reveals that Deadpool never cashed any of his checks.<ref>''[[Uncanny X-Force]]'' #5 (2011).</ref>

===Sexual orientation===
In December 2013, Deadpool was confirmed as being [[Pansexuality|pansexual]] by ''Deadpool'' writer Gerry Duggan via Twitter.<ref>{{cite tweet|number=408076514568065024|user=GerryDuggan|title=@JD_Boucher tell the kids I have a...|access-date=September 6, 2015|date=December 4, 2013}}</ref> However, this post on Twitter has since been deleted by Gerry Duggan. When asked about Deadpool's sexuality, co-creator Fabian Nicieza stated, "Deadpool is whatever sexual inclination his brain tells him he is in THAT moment. And then the moment passes."<ref>{{cite tweet|number=631482629494149121|user=FabianNicieza|title=Deadpool is whatever sexual...|access-date= September 6, 2015|date=August 12, 2015}}</ref> Nicieza has also stated,

<blockquote>Not trying to be dismissive, but readers always want to 'make a character their own', and often that is to the exclusion of what the character might mean to other fans. I've been dogged with the DP sexuality questions for YEARS. It is a bit tiring. He is NO sex and ALL sexes. He is yours and everyone else's. So not dismissive, but rather the epitome of inclusive.<ref>{{cite web|title = Deadpool Co-Creator Weighs in on Character's Sexuality – Comic Book Resources|url = http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/deadpool-co-creator-weighs-in-on-characters-sexuality|website = www.comicbookresources.com|date = August 19, 2015|access-date = September 6, 2015}}</ref></blockquote>

===Powers and abilities===
Deadpool's primary power is an accelerated healing factor, depicted by various writers at differing levels of efficiency. The speed of his healing factor depends on the severity of the wound and Deadpool's mental state. It works most efficiently when he is awake, alert, and in good spirits.<ref>{{Cite book|title=By Daniel Way:The Complete Collection By Daniel Way: Volume One}}</ref> Deadpool's accelerated healing factor is strong enough that he has survived complete incineration and decapitation more than once.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Although his head normally has to be reunited with his body to heal a decapitation wound,<ref>''Cable & Deadpool'' #44.</ref><ref>''Thunderbolts'' #131.</ref><ref>''Deadpool Team-Up'' #898.</ref> he was able to regrow his head after having it pulverized by the [[Hulk]] in the graphic novel ''Deadpool Kills the Marvel Universe''.{{issue|date=December 2015}}

Deadpool's brain cells are similarly affected, with dying [[neuron]]s being rejuvenated at a super accelerated rate. This allows Deadpool to recover from any head wounds, and it renders him nearly invulnerable to psychic and telepathic powers,<ref>''Cable & Deadpool'' #8.</ref><ref>''Deadpool'' #69.</ref> although this ability is inconsistent.<ref>''Cable & Deadpool: Enemy of the State''.</ref><ref>''Agent X'' #14.</ref> It has been revealed that at the time his healing ability was given to him, Deadpool suffered from some form of cancer; after the healing factor was given to him, it made his normal cells as well as his cancerous cells unable to die, giving him a heavily scarred appearance beneath his suit.{{issue|date=April 2015}}

Deadpool's body is highly resistant to most drugs and toxins, due to his accelerated healing factor. For example, it is extremely difficult for him to become intoxicated.<ref>''Deadpool'' #12.</ref> He can be affected by certain drugs, such as tranquilizers if he is exposed to a large enough dosage.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Unlike Wolverine, whose wounds sometimes cause excruciating pain as they heal depending on the severity, Deadpool has some degree of pain insensitivity.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/103688/does-deadpool-feel-pain|title=11 Does Deadpool feel pain ?|date=September 25, 2015|language=en-US}}</ref>

He revealed that the only thing keeping Wade alive was his "spell of darkest necromancy". Although Thanos removed this curse in order to kill Deadpool, he felt forced to immediately bring him back using "a fusion of necromancy and science" in order to request his aid in tracking down Mistress Death, who had gone missing.<ref>''Deadpool vs Thanos'' #1.</ref>

Deadpool is a highly trained [[assassination|assassin]] and [[mercenary]]. He is adept in multiple forms of [[martial art]]s, including [[Savate]].<ref>''X-Force'' #1 (Aug. 1991)</ref> Deadpool is an extraordinary athlete, and an expert swordsman and marksman. He is skilled in the use of multiple weapons, including [[katana]]s, knives, grenades, and guns. His accelerated healing factor may contribute to his abilities, allowing him to perform the intense exercise for extended periods of time with minimal aches and fatigue.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Deadpool: The Complete Collection By Daniel Way: Volume One}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Deadpool: 15 Things Only True Fans Know About His Katana |url=https://screenrant.com/deadpool-facts-trivia-katanas-marvel/ |access-date=March 28, 2019 |work=[[Screen Rant]] |date=May 8, 2018}}</ref> Although in earlier years he was originally portrayed as having superhuman strength, he is no longer depicted as having this ability.<ref>''Cable & Deadpool'' #36.</ref>

Over the years, Deadpool has owned a number of personal teleportation devices. Also, during Deadpool's first ongoing comic, he possesses a device that projected holographic disguises, allowing him to go undercover or conceal his appearance. Deadpool is [[Multilingualism|multilingual]], with the ability to speak fluently in German, Spanish, [[American Sign Language|ASL]], and Japanese, in addition to his native English.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.superherodb.com/deadpool/10-835/powers/|title=Deadpool|website=www.superherodb.com|access-date=October 21, 2018}}</ref>

Since Deadpool is aware that he is a fictional character,<ref name="DeadpoolV3Issue34" /> he uses this knowledge to his advantage to deal with opponents or gain knowledge to which he should not normally have access, such as reading past issues of his and others' comics.<ref>''Deadpool Team-Up'' #885.</ref> For example, Deadpool knows he has a Wikipedia article and hopes his fans keep his page updated.<ref name="Deadpool #36"/>

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
In the [[Age of Apocalypse]] timeline, Deadpool was redubbed '''Dead Man Wade''' and reimagined as a bitter, humorless member of Apocalypse's [[Pale Riders]], having received his flawed healing factor from Apocalypse's eugenics program. Sent with his team to invade the Savage Land, he attempted to unleash chaos upon the sanctuary but was killed by Nightcrawler, who teleported his head off his body and hid it in a crater.<ref>''X-Calibre'' #3 (May 1995).</ref> Later, Dead Man Wade was revealed to be resurrected like many of the other Alpha mutants.<ref>''Age of Apocalypse'' #3.</ref>

===''Deadpool Killology''===
====''Deadpool Kills the Marvel Universe''====
In the storyline ''Deadpool Kills the Marvel Universe'', the X-Men send Deadpool to a mental hospital for therapy. The doctor treating him is actually [[Psycho-Man]] in disguise, who attempts to torture and brainwash Deadpool into becoming his personal minion. The procedure fails but leaves Deadpool even more mentally unhinged, erasing the "serious" and "Screwball" voices in his head and replacing them with a voice that only wants destruction. Under "Evil Voice's" influence, Deadpool develops a more nihilistic world view and as a result, after killing Psycho-Man by repeatedly smashing him against a desk, (and after he burns the hospital by using gasoline) he begins assassinating every superhero and supervillain on Earth, starting with the [[Fantastic Four]] and even killing the Watcher, in an apparent attempt to rebel against his comic book creators. The book ends with him breaking into the "real" world and confronting the Marvel writers and artists who are writing the book. He says to the reader that once he is done with this universe, "I'll find you soon enough."<ref>''Deadpool Kills the Marvel Universe'' #1.</ref>

On April 4, 2013, Cullen Bunn revealed that, after the events of ''Deadpool Killustrated'', the next and last part of the "Deadpool Killology" is ''Deadpool Kills Deadpool'' that the murderous, nihilistic Deadpool that appeared in ''Deadpool Kills the Marvel Universe'' and ''Killustrated'' is called '''"Dreadpool"''' and, in the series, he hunted down all versions of Deadpool while "our" Deadpool, the light-hearted Merc With A Mouth, hunted down Dreadpool. Bunn stated that the [[Deadpool Corps]] appeared along with many other versions of Deadpool and new versions.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} The first book was released in July 2013. The first issue opens with Deadpool dealing with yet another attack by ULTIMATUM, after which the Deadpool Corps quickly ropes the titular character into the crisis. Over the course of the storyline, the Deadpool Corps is killed (not including Headpool, who was already killed prior to the events of the storyline), and it concludes in Issue #4, where Deadpool clashes with Dreadpool, who is eventually shown the error of his ways and killed by Deadpool in vengeance for causing the death of his friends. Somehow, the mainstream Deadpool finds his way back, but not before the reader is aware that Dreadpool is still alive and scheming.{{issue|date=October 2014}}

* Two variations of Wade Wilson appear in the live-action [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' film series]], portrayed by [[Ryan Reynolds]].

He is supposedly killed by [[Sabretooth (comics)|Victor Creed]], but is later revealed to have been transformed by Major [[William Stryker]] into a mutant killer "Weapon XI", who possesses other mutants' powers, including [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Scott Summers]]' optic blasts, [[Kestrel (Marvel Comics)|John Wraith]]'s teleportation, [[Logan (film series character)|Wolverine]]'s healing factor, and a pair of extendable blades. He is also completely obedient to Stryker via [[Chris Bradley]]'s [[technopathy]].

** Following the events of the live-action film ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'', which resets the ''X-Men'' film series' timeline from 1973 onward, Reynolds appears as a new variation of Wilson in ''[[Deadpool (film)|Deadpool]]'' (2016). This version is a mercenary who is diagnosed with late-stage cancer and turns to [[Francis Fanny|Ajax]] after he offers a cure. Ajax tortures Wilson in order to catalyze the treatment, which eventually results in recessive mutant genes activating, causing the latter's disfigurement and healing factor. In response, Wilson develops a vendetta against Ajax and undergoes a quest to force him to fix his disfigurement before eventually killing him upon learning it would be impossible.
