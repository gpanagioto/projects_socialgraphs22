 We won't let it happen again, Mr. Mackey, m'kay? Hey, are you guys gonna come to Ike's party this weekend? No, it's his bris. I don't know. But there's gonna be lots of food, and a band. Uhhh... I'm not sure. Why did they search ''us''? That marijawana never even ''made'' it to us. How's it going? Why bad? Because they're an addictive solution to a greater problem, causing disease of both body and mind with consequences far outweighing their supposed benefits. No. Hey, are you going to come to Ike's bris this weekend? No, not ham, you fat fuck! Your heart? Hey, wait! Stop who? What? Chop off his wee wee?! Are you sure?! That can't be true! My parents wouldn't do that! I won't believe it! I ''won't''! I have to ask my mom and dad! Mom! Dad! Mom, Dad, what exactly are this party for? Meaning what? AAAAAGGGGGHHHHH!!!!! I can't believe my parents are cannibals! I have to save my little brother! I have to send him away until my parents come to their senses! Come on, Ike! Cover me for a while. I'll find a place to hide him and come back. Just give me 30 minutes. Come on, Ike! Come on, Ike, hurry up!  Where is the next train going? You wanna go to Nebraska, Ike? I need one ticket for my little brother. Huh? But my parents are gonna cut off his ding-dong! They've just gone crazy for a while. Please, mister, I have to hide my brother until they come to their senses. Dammit! Ike, if you wanna keep your penis, you have to get on this train. Ready, Ike? Kick the baby! Goodbye, Ike! Be safe! I'll come find you in Nebraska when Mom and Dad are back to normal! There, what do you think? I'm making a dummy Ike doll. My parents think he's out with me right now, and I have to bring him back for dinner. Not when  if I say he's sick and put him to bed right away. No, go away! Bad dog! I used a bunch of bones from the butcher shop. Anyways, I need you guys to help me so that my parents don't realize Ike is gone. Knock it off, asshole! Sorry, Mom. I just had to deal with Ike. He-he's been cranky.  Ah, I'm gonna take him up to the bathroom to get washed up. No, Mom-uh, he, he doesn't want you kissing him. Put him down, you stupid dog! Hey, wait a minute. How come Ike's tombstone has the Canadian flag on it? What?? You mean to tell me that all this time I've been trying to protect Ike from having his fireman cut off, and he's not even my real brother?! Dude, Ike isn't dead. He's in Nebraska! Ooh, who the hell cares? He's not even my responsibility.  You bastards. Aw, how the hell should I know?  All the time: "Look out for your little brother, Kyle!", "Take care of your little brother, Kyle", and he wasn't even really my little brother. Yeah, right.  He's ''not'' my brother!  I'm sorry, Ike. What do you want?! Ohhh, no you don't. That isn't gonna work on ''me'', Canadian! No way! There's no real connection between us. It was all a big lie. Go on, Canadian! Beat it! I'm through getting in trouble for you! You stay away from my little brother! ''You'' aren't gonna cut off his wee wee. ''Not today'', you sick-ass weirdo! And ''you!'' You should be ashamed of yourself! Don't you understand that us males are defined by our firemen?! No! No, it isn't true! It's okay, Ike. I'm here.  Yeah. You know, I've learned something today. Family isn't about whose blood you have, it's about who you care about. And that's why I feel like ''you'' guys are ''more'' than just friends. You're my family.  Except for Cartman. M'kay?
