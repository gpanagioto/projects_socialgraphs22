''Baby you are so fine, and shit!<br>The shit you do, the shit you say; I'd jump on your shit any day!<br>[the boys walk in]'' Oh, hello there, children. Uh, from your ass, children. Oh. The Black Death? Are you sure? LaToya Jackson, children. But I think back in those days it meant something else: the plague! It says here the word, "shit" has been around for over 600 years. It comes from the Anglo-Saxon word, "skite". The Black Plague. Over half of Europe was killed by it. Look at this, children.  It says that the people in England believed that the plague was a curse, a dark magic infliction brought on by a mass utterance of a ''word'' of curse. Of course! I've never even thought about why we use the term "curse word" before. Children, we've got to warn those producers in Hollywood that the plague, and "shit", could be linked! Hold on a minute, Mr. Producer! My name is Chef, and these are the children! We've come to warn ''you'' about "shit". Hey! Hold on a minute! Haven't you people noticed all the strange things going on?  Damn cracker-ass producers! I don't know, children. I guess we've got to get the word out to people some other way. Who are you? We've got to find people who would know what the hell this is all about. Children, we're goin' to have to go to the land of castles, knights, and kings! 'Scuse me. Do you work here? We just need help identifying this.  Uh, yeah. We didn't mean to. But I don't get it. People use curse words all the time. Knights of Standards and Practices? Oh no! Tonight is the "Night of a Million Shits" on HBC! It's gonna be said over and over! I'm very proud of you, children. Let's all go home and find a nice white woman to make love to.
