You do have testicular cancer. Now, the good new is it hasn't spread anywhere. We should... probably schedule to have them re- Your prescription for what? What the hell is going on? This is the tenth case I've seen this week. It can't be a coincidence. Something in this town is giving men testicular cancer.  We are all forgetting what is really at issue here! Look around!
