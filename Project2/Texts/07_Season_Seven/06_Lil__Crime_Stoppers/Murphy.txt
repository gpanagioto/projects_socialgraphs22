 Soho, tell us, rookies, you ah... find yourself a little bonus in that house?? Come on! We all skim a little off the top. Oh. Or are you too good for that?  You think you're gonna waltz in here and clean up the system. Is that it? LOOK, we all work hard! And we deserve more than the thirty-thousand a year we get paid! So what if we take in a little on the side? Why don't you and your rookie friends ''make us'' No problem, sir. No problem at all. So, what did you boys have to say to the lieutenant? Maybe you decided you needed to tell him about our... bonus money. They're dead! That's right. We're partners in the drug business. Everything was fine until these "super-cops" joined the force.  That's right.  I think we'll take a hundred percent now. That's right.
