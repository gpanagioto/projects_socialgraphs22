Toolshed! Mysterion, if Cartman's gone, why are we still calling ourselves Coon and Friends? Well then, perhaps we should return to our secret base and bake some more! The Necronomicon? All right, superheroes. Back to our secret base! Aw, dude, it's Captain Hindsight. Um dude, are you okay? Look dude, we don't need to play Superhero anymore. We can just go home.  All right, superheroes, we've got to find out more about this Necronomicon thing! "It is used by cults around the world, most notably the Cult of Cthulhu." We know some of these people. There's Mr. Adler, from shop class. And those two geeky computer guys. Dude, why would the Goth kids worship Cthulhu? "In strange aeons even Death may die?" What does that mean, Human Kite? Toolshed! Let him go, dude, or else we'll totally tell our parents on you! Oh my God. Oh my God, they- they killed Kenny! Dude, Kenny, what'd you run away for?! We've gotta fight these guys!
