I mean, look guys, I know it's just the Dolphins, but Tebow is definitely our quarterback for the future. What do you think, Nelson?  You didn't see the game? What the hell were you doing? A musical?  What?  Nuh uh.  Noh uh. Must be... a pretty hot and steamy show. What's it called?  Oh. Wicked. Hey do you uh, do you want some alcohol or somethin', Sharon? Okay, I'll be right back.  Can I get a scotch and soda?   Oh, yeah, it's not really what I expected. To be honest, I'm just here for the blowjob. From what I heard I figured the show must be really sexy and hot, but... I just don't see it happening. Subliminal messages?  Whoa, no way! You just don't get it, Stotch! I'm telling you, go see Wicked! It's the best time! She started in the car, and then it lasted the whole drive home, and then, she kept going for like another twenty minutes. Get tickets, Stotch, it's worth it. Uh, shit, I don't know, some green chick and a goat or something. Look, I thought Broadway musicals weren't for me either, but I just didn't know about the whole subtext thing, you know? I couldn't really appreciate 'em till now. Really?? Say Sharon, how would you like to go to New York for the weekend?  I got plane tickets and a hotel room! We leave in three hours! Oh don't worry. I've taken care of everything! You're staying the weekend with the Feegans! Oh man! It was great! A different Broadway show every night! I'm telling you guys, New York is the place to be! It felt like a dream, bro. Broadway is simply the greatest time a dude can have. Just kind of sucks to be back here now, you know? I mean there's no culture here. Only Broadway show in Denver is "Wicked" and I've already taken Sharon to see it twenty three times. Hey. Wait a minute. Why not bring Broadway to South Park?  Think about it, brah. How hard can writing a musical be? We need some musicians, some actors. We can put on our own shows right here in town. And hold!  Uhh, this better be important. Really? Oh my Gaw!  Take a break, guys. this could be it! Not much, sup with you guys? Same as you guys. Trying to get men lengthier, better-quality blowjobs. My musical has ''lots'' of subtext. And then she does. It's a metaphor.  Well sorry if you guys think you have a monopoly on subtext! But us up-and-comers have a voice too! Sorry if my work isn't up to your standards!   What is it now?   Then what am I supposed to do?! Run? I've studied musicals! I've seen them all! I could do this!  Whassup brah?! Sup brah?! Right here, brah!  What makes you the brauthority brah?! What brah?! What brah?! What brah?! I do respect you, bro! I do respect you, bro! I respect you, bro! Okay!  Oh man, I'm so glad we put our differences aside! That's what bros do! Hey, really?? Oh, that is beautiful! Bro'dwaaay! Ooof.  Hi babe. Sorry, I'm...  kind of hanging out with the guys. Yeah, yeah, and we really made some progress with the show. Andrew Lloyd Webber and those guys are gonna help us with it. Aw Sharon, you're the best. I'm not feeling a hundred percent; do you care if I go lay down?  Alright babe. Okay. What's Shelly doing?  She's WHAT?! OH!  AWWWWWWW! Why didn't you tell me Shelly was gonna see "Wicked"?! She's too young for that stuff! This is what I get! I drank from the lie that is Broadway and now it has my daughter! I can't! Aww! Alright, look. There's something I should have told you a long time ago, Sharon. Broadway musicals... aren't what you think they are! They're subliminal propaganda to get women to give more blowjobs! On the outside it's all singing and dancing, but buried in it are commands to perform oral sex. It's called subtext. D'augh. Do you remember the night after we saw "Wicked"? And after "Lion King" in New York? "Godspell"? "Mamma Mia"? Broadway shows' sole purpose is to make women famished for blowjobs! I'm so sorry Sharon. No, they're... they're bros, Sharon. Stephen Sondheim, Elton John, Andrew Lloyd Webber... They're total bros who hang out at Hooters. Sharon, I'm so sorry. AAAA! Shelly!   Shelly, come on. We have to go! Right now, Shelly!  Shelly, you are not watching this trash! Now, come on! Oh you fucking pervert! Shelly!   Sorry! Sorry. Agh!    I shouldn't have tried to brainwash you. You have every right to be mad. Really?  I don't know, but whatever it is, it's worth the ticket price, because couples that pay to see it are stronger, better, and much, much happier.
