I am ''very'' disappointed in ''you'', young man. You should be ashamed of yourself. What could have possessed you to be so stupid?  We-hell, "sorry" isn't going to cut the cheese this time, mister! I'm afraid I'm going to have to suspend you from school. Well, I guess that's the grown-up way to put it, yes. It was an error of judgment, Mr. Mackey, but ''I'm'' afraid I have to let you go for it. We searched each one of those kids, but came up empty. We had to let them go home, and one of them now has half a lid of Jamaican grass because of ''you!'' There, there, now. Maybe this will all blow over someday and we can give you a job as a janitor cleaning up vomit with that pink sawdust stuff. We were wrong for shunning you, Mr. Mackey, and we apologize. We should have realized that you needed help. You'll thank us later.
