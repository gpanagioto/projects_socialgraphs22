Alright, Ms. Reno, let's go over the plan. We'll drop you on the northwest corner of the backyard. You hop into the back of the house and find the quintuplets. When you see them, you sayâ€¦ Good. And then hand them the Easter eggs filled with tear gas. Are you ready? Code blue!  You can't see them, boys. They're happily reunited with their father. Aaa-a-a-aaa-ah.
