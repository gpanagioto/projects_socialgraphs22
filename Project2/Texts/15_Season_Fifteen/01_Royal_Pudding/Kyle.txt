 Ike, where are you going?  ...I don't know. Well, could-couldn't just you know, get rid of the part of Tooth Decay? I am Tooth Decay. Your teeth shall be mine. With candy and treats I will take- I'm just doing the line. Uh I'm trying, Mr. Mackey, I really am. Oh no, dental floss, what will I do? I mean, come on guys, that's pretty cool, right? My little brother is a knight in Canada.  Hmmm, yeah.
