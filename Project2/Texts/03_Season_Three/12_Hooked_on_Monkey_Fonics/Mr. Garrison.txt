Okay, children, we have a new student joining us from home school. Now, his parents are very worried about his safety, so please don't be too cruel to him. Mark?  Alright, children, let's just try to pretend there isn't a little boy in a huge plastic hamster ball here, and go on with our studies. Now, who can tell me when Columbus sailed the seas and discovered America?  Ehyes, Mark? Because you never know the right answer, butt-for-brains! Yes, Mark? Well, very impressive, Mark. You should be able to throw the grading curve and flunk ''all'' these little bastards.  Now, who can tell me what country Columbus was from?  Put your hand down, creampuff. Oh, please God, let it be forever.
