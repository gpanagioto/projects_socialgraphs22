We've got a big sales event going on, folks.  Hey guys. Can I get you in a 2014 Hummer? Rocktober sales event, guys.  Only a few more guitar licks left in Rocktober, guys. The fuck? Well I don't have any children. Offer it last year's Christmas in Rocksummer prizes?  You've got a fully automated sound system and your sunroof is operated right here. What do you think? Huh? Can you see yourself in one of these puppies?
