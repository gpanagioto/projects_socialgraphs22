Wull yeah, but, maybe ''people'' will read my memoirs and like, apply its lessons to their own lives. ''You're'' a towel! Now what am I gonna do? I gotta pay rent and I just wasted three weeks writin' my memoirs. It's time for me to stop bein' so irresponsible. I've gotta shape up, focus, an' come up with ''real'' solutions to my problems.  Oh, maybe I shouldn't. All right, I'll just use my special gettin'-high powers one more time.   This is a really good idea.  McTowelie.

 Oh, why does it matter? Fuck South Park? ... I don't know if you wanna say "Fuck South Park."  Hey Randy, did you go make a deal with another weed company? Med Men? But, those guys are posers. Jesus... You know, I knew a guy who thought weed should be for everybody. A guy who believed in integrity. I don't understand who you even are anymore. YOU're a towel!

You know what the problem is? It's the schwag. All those stands and seeds, they just go to waste, man. It's like, we sell all the good parts of the weed, but we throw away, like, tons and tons of all the leftover shit. You can sell that crap as mulch to a hardware company. Even if we only get 10 cents a pound, we have like a million pounds of it. Yeah, I'll take some onion rings.  Best burgers I ever had. You sell hamburgers here. Did you find anyone else to take 'em? What?! How are we gonna do that? Yeee-haw!

Look, I'm sorry, Randy, but marijuana just doesn't grow in the cold.  I have lots of left-over Mexican Joker. Okay, so how about we combine- what's left of the Mexican Joker with some of the Season Finale? What's wrong? I know. I know. I can't print labels fast enough. What are you talking about? What are we gonna do? 
I thought I was Jerry... Oh, that's even better. Everyone will think we're dorks!  
How's it going, Randy? I think it's better than last year's.  Randy... I... I thought... you were in jail. Yeah I sort of... sold it... at half price... to Tolkien's dad across the street.
