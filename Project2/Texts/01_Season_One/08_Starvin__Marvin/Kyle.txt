Yeah! Oh, cool. Sally Struthers, dude. She used to be on ''Full House''. Yeah, she's fatter than Cartman. Did they say if it's waterproof? What did she say? Ass-rammer. Ask her if we get the watch right away. I can't wait to get out of school and get our Teiko sports watch. Hey, look you guys. The digital sports watch is here. Hey, it looks like one of those Etheropians. Maybe they took it literally when we said we wanted to adopt a kid. Whoa! That was cool. What's your name dude? Nice to meet you Starvin' Marvin. Come on Starvin' Marvin, I want you to meet my little brother. Okay, okay, wewe'll switch off. Starvin' Marvin can stay here for a week, then at Stan's, then with me. Totally. We do! This is our new Ethernopian, Starvin' Marvin. Yeah, that one. Ah, I told you we shouldn't have brought him to school dude. But I thought we were ''supposed'' to care on Thanksgiving. Because why? Then ''you'' take care of him. You better watch what you say Cartman! ''You'' might be poor and hungry some day. Wow! Those are some pissed off turkeys! I don't know. Do you know where he is, Marvin? Here you go turkeys! You bastards! Yeah, I like him a ''lot'' more than Cartman. Yeah. And that means that McGyver is a real person too.
