 We've intercepted this videotape the terrorists made for broadcast. Luckily we've kept it from being broadcast to the public.   Later in the video we can see another imaginary hostage; this one reading a forced statement. Gentlemen, the terrorists appear to have complete control of our imagination. It's only a matter of time before... our imaginations start running wild. What I am about to tell you is highly classified. Two days ago, Muslim terrorists hijacked our imagination.  Frankly we don't know what their next move is or how to stop them. That's why we've asked you here, M. Night Shyal-amalam. ''[the camera zooms out a bit and shows the name tag in front of the man: the director M. Night Shyalaman] The Sixth Sense, Signs, The Village'', all very clever films. But can you use your amazing idea brain now to help us stop the terrorists? N, no. No, they're terrorists. They've been linked to Al Qaeda. No- No. That's not an idea, that's a twist. We need ideas.  Mr. Bay, can you think of any idea how to outwit these terrorists?  No no! We need ideas how to stop the terrorists!  Those aren't ideas, those are special effects! I know you don't. Get him out of here!  Aaand being that we are all big Mel Gibson film fans, we thought maybe you could help us.  Yes, uh, I don't suppose you have any creative ideas how to fight these terrorists? Yeah. Say what you will about Mel Gibson, but the son of a bitch knows story structure. Get the videotape and do a background check on everyone in it!  If that kid isn't imaginary, I want to know who he is, where he's from, and who his friends are!  Who are you?... You boys need to come with us on a matter of national security. There's no time! You need to come with us right now!  We aren't going to hurt your little friends. We just need information.
