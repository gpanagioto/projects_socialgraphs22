Here, Stanley, I made your favorite potato dish. I want you to feel better, okay? Oh. Stan got served at school today. Let's not make a big deal out of it. That was the right thing to do.  Well, nice going, Randy! Really great advice you gave our son here! Those kids showed up to serve Stan again and he danced back! It's on!  Randy, oh my God!
