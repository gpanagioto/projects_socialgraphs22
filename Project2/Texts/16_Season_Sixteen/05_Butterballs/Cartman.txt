Nonono, I'm tellin' you guys, music videos have devolved to nothing but pretty girls wearing skin-tight clothes, and singin' songs about their vajayjays. Used to be chicks sang about their relationships; now it's all "my vajayjay this, my vajayjay that." But clearly that's what sells. Think about it. When was the last time you turned on a music video and didn't see some chick strumming a guitar singing about her vajayjay?  See? You can't remember. He has a point. I have balls. Still balls. 'Kay kewl, hold it right there. Kewl.  We're putting up movie posters, Kyle! The premiere is tomorrow! But since you walked out on the video, you don't get to come!  The studio backed out! The producer had a change of heart! BOOOOO!
