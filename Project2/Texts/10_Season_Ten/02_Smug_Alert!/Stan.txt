Oh hey Kyle. Helping my Dad pick out some cool new power tools. What are you doing? Yeah?  Going away party? What do you mean?  Moving away?? Kyle can't move away! Where's the going-away party?  Kyle? Kyle! What?! Kyle! Du-what is going on?! Mr. Broflovski, please. Kyle's my best friend. Well... Maybe they'll change. Nooo! I will. I ''will'' get everyone to drive hybrid cars! I swear it! ''Come on, people. Come on, people now. [Cartman and Butters enter]'' I'm writing a song about the importance of hybrid cars, so maybe people will change their ways. Well if I have any chance of getting Kyle back, I have to get people to stop driving SUVs! You know, Cartman, you may be stoked now, but I bet you're gonna find that withuot Kyle around to rip on, your life is empty, and hollow. ''Come on, people. Come on, people now.'' ''Come on, everybody be people now''  Yeah. Ow! What?! Smog? There's never been smog over South Park before. Smug? No, no, I'm ''asking'' if there's a listing for Broflovski in San Francisco! They just moved there! Oh crap, Ranger McFriendly. What is that? George Clooney's acceptance speech? What about San Francisco?  I'm gonna try and warn Kyle to get out of San Francisco. Can't somebody else operate this? I can't really reach. No... What? Kyle! Dude, what happened??   Dude, I'm so glad you're not dead.
