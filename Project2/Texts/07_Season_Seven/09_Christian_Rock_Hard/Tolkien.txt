What?! We don't ''have'' a bass guitar.  Hey, there ''was'' a bass guitar in my basement. So, what are we doing?  I don't know how to play bass.  I'm gettin' sick of your stereotypes! God-damnit!  Why the hell did you tell us to dress nice to take us out here?  This Christian album better make as much money as you said it would, tubby!   Why the hell would I be looking way over there?? Cartman, what the hell is all this? But you spent all the money we made! Yeah. You're gonna hurt the band. Good job, dickhead! You lost the entire audience!
