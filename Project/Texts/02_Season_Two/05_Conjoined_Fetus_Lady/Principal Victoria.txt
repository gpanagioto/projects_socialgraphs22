Well, Mrs. Broflovski, it certainly is a thrill seeing your cheery face again. What seems to be pissing you off today? O-of course you do. Oh, and uh, what disease is that? What's that?  She does? No-o, I never did. Did you say a fetus, sticking out from her head? Well, I'll talk to Nurse Gollum, but I'm sure she'll be delighted. Let's say around 8:00? Now, you did say she has a fetus on her head? Oh. Eh, sooo, I hear that the South Park Cows are playing for the State Finals in dodgeball tonight. So did you ever think of just, you know, having it cut off? Ooohh, so I suppose that's out. Uh-how about a hat, then? Ooohh, yeess, a Conjoined Twin Myslexia Awareness Week. You know, that has a nice ring. Oh, my, what an ungrateful bitch.
