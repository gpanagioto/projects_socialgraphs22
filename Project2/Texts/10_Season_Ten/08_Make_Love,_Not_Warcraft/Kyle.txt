  If you didn't eat so much, you wouldn't have diarrhea all the time, fatass! Come on, we have to finish the quest in Stonehaven.  See where I am? It's this way.  Wow, look at all these people playing right now. Who is this? It's all right. He can't kill us unless we agree to duel.   Who is that guy? The past...four nights we've tried to play, he shows up and kills us! He's targeting us. Ike, look out!  We don't have a choice, dude. That guy killed our characters 14 times. Boars? Dude, boars are only worth two experience points apiece. Do you know how many we would have to kill to get up 30 levels? Dude, my mouse-clicking finger hurts. Me too. Hang on, I'm chaining my fire spells for max range. Hold on, this fight could last more than twelve hours. What if we run out of food? What's the autolocate macro? Okay, right behind Stan. Casting...there's an 8-second cast time. No, ah, I'm an arcane fire mage. Cast on him again. Aaaa...  Carpal tunnel! Carpal tunnel! It's aaaah!  I can't. Just leave me behind. I'm out of mana, I told you. Attack!  Yeah yeah. That was such Ã¼ber pwnage Oh yeah.
