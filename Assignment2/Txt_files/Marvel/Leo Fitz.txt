'''Leopold James Fitz''' is a [[character (arts)|fictional character]] that originated in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] before appearing in [[Marvel Comics]]. The character, created by [[Joss Whedon]], [[Jed Whedon]] and [[Maurissa Tancharoen]], first appeared in the [[Pilot (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|pilot episode]] of ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' in September 2013, and has continually been portrayed by [[Iain De Caestecker]].

In the series, Fitz is one of [[S.H.I.E.L.D. (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'s top scientific minds. His scientific knowledge is vast, and as an engineer and inventor he has developed many of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s staple devices and gadgets. Many of his storylines involve his relationship with his best friend, and later wife, [[Jemma Simmons]]. Over the course of the series, Fitz suffers multiple traumas and becomes aware of a darker and more ruthless side to his character. His darker [[alter ego]] is commonly known as '''The Doctor'''.

When I found out about it, I did my own research and correlated it together. It's just something that should never be trivialized. It's a real and serious thing to a lot of people, brain trauma, so we just have to constantly be respectful towards it. We talk about it all the time. Even if you don't see it or it's not obvious, it's always something that's in our heads that we're keeping going. It's the realization that you never get fully better, it's about embracing the new side of you and making that work in the world that you're in. I suppose the idea of a cure—I don't know if that could happen."<ref name="HenstridgeDeCaesteckerS2" /> For Fitz's costume design, Foley tried to have his clothes reflect his personality, without "getting too cliché...we try and play up his "heritage style"...using classic design details on him like paisley & leather elbow patches and mixing them with different plaids."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Kucharski |first=Joe |date=December 19, 2013 |title=Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

De Caestecker, in describing the character, said that "Fitz has got this funny kind of temper. He's quite passionate about what he does. So those moments where—I don't think he's someone that really responds very quickly to emotion; he doesn't really understand emotions as much".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Byrne |first=Craig |date=February 2, 2014 |title=S.H.I.E.L.D.
