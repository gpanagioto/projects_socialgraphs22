I don't know. Ih... in our... butt?  Maybe... No. Yeah, isn't that the damnedest thing? Hm. Aw, dude, I think I might have it.  It makes perfect sense. Okay, w-work with me on this: if you eat food, you crap out your butt, right? Alright, now keep working with me here, it's getting a little complicated. If you eat food and crap out your butt, then maybe, if you stuck food in your butt, you crap out your mouth.  Hm? What, that's not dumb. Think about it: food goes in the mouth, comes out the butt. Food goes in the butt, comes out the mouth. That's not dumb, that's genius. Have you ever tried it? I bet you twenty bucks it'll work! Okay, let's go, Jew!   God, let a man crap! I'm doin' it already!! God, give me a minute!  I can't-, I can't do it with you guys watching. Turn around. Ugh! Do you really think I'd be that deceitful, you guys?!   You owe me twenty bucks, dickface! Kyle, could you help me out? I need some advice.  It's just that... I can't decide what to buy with your twenty dollars!   I went down to the bank and got Kyle's twenty-dollar bill turned into twenty single-dollar bills. So? So now I can do this!  Yeess! Yeess, Kyle's money! Mmmm, Kyle's money!  Oh, it feels so good on my skin! Mmmm. Gee Kyle, don't be a sore loser. It's over, okay? I won. Let it go.  That's stupid and immature, Cartman!  I took Kyle's twenty dollars down to the bank again, and I got it changed into quarters! So now I can dump them into this little pool and swim in them all day long!  O-hoo, what's that, Kyle? Heh...  what?
