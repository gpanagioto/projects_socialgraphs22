Well, what are we gonna do, Mayor?! We have to stop these abductors from being able to get into our town! Wait, that's it. A wall. We could build a huge city wall all around South Park so that we have complete control over who comes in. Your ancestors put up a great wall that kept Mongolians out for thousands of years. We know you can do it for us. Stan, our abduction problems are over. We got the new Child Tracker. If anybody takes you, we'll be able to locate your exact location within two meters. There, I think that's got it.  You can barely even tell you have one on. There is no other team. Don't worry, it'll still be fun for us.  Yeah, and you kicked ass!  Here you go, Stanley. This should hold you over for three years. The news says that at your age you aren't safe with us, son. You have to get out of here before we abduct you. We can't tell you because we can't know where you are!  Good-bye, kids. We'll... never forget you.  What's the matter?    Sweetheart, you saw the news... Don't you worry. I'm sure that Stan and all the other kids are somewhere safe, off in a whole new city by now, making a new life for themselves. What's going on? What the hell are they doin' here?! Rabble! Rabble rabble! Wait wait. I learned some Mongolian in college.  Ah, let's see. Uh. K-kids, uh, Bi kute. Bi salnek kute. Uh-d tah tasobarro. Bi kute.  Staaan. Your name... is Staaan!  No, no. You know who was right all along? The Mongolians.  They knew that you just can't wall yourself off from the outside world. Putting walls up never helps anything. Tearing them down brings us together. Yes, kids.
