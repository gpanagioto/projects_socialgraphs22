No, I missed the whole thing. I always try to get to the pumpkin patch really early. We've got to take matters into our own hands. None of us is safe. Yeah, right. Like they'll handle anything.  What are bent pits?  You do? Wait wait wait wait. What the fuck are you talking about? Dude, is your dad home? We can't find our dads either. We asked our moms, and they said this has been going on for years. We've got to find them before something stupider happens. There's another guy. Someone else who was in the witches' club that hasn't been around for a while.  Butter him up, Butters. Butters, come on! We've gotta go! I guess our witches were gonna sacrifice your witch, but then the bad witch showed up and now the witch we called just arrived. There's witches everywhere!
