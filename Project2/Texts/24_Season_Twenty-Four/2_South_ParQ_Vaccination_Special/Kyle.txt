What?  You're not posting anything! Do you have any idea what you've done? What if they make us go back to remote learning?! I don't want to go back to being quarantined at home like some of the other kids still are! Why do people think we all did the period joke? You guys are gonna go and tell everyone the truth about who's fault this is! I didn't do anything! What?! Dude!  Are you just gonna stand there and listen to this crap?! Will you shut up about that!? Nobody cares about your stupid broship!  Yes.  Because you guys pulled a prank and made the teacher leave, and now everybody hates us. What?! Yeah, but we already paid you. We're Kommunity Kidz. We help seniors get vaccinated. Cartman, just stick to the fucking plan! RUN!!  Why did you almost blow it at the very end, you idiot?!  Will you please say something to him?!  All good? I don't see what choice we have.  What?  What are you doing?  We are giving these to the teachers at the school!  Right, Stan?  I'm gonna put these somewhere safe so no one gets tempted to do the wrong thing!  Hey, dad. Look, I'm okay. I won't be home until tomorrow 'cause... well, I'm doing something really important.  You're not... worried?  They're for our teachers. It's not like that. Dad, please don't-  Please don't say it.  Shit.  I'm just getting things ready to go. Alright, Stan, look. It's just the pressure of everything, okay!? My dad called and... I don't want my mom to die.  Nothing, Kenny. Everything's fine. Butters?  You're a part of this too? Oh no! Oh, Jesus, look!   What was that!? You know we can't get into the school! You didn't even try! . He didn't try because he wants to sell the vaccines for money! Wow. Okay. I thought we had gotten past that, but -- Are you seriously saying what I think?  We still have a bunch of vaccines here. What happens now? Uh huh. Do we really have to do this? That- that all seems overly confusing. Aw, come on. What about sleepovers? We can't take those away from Kenny. I don't even know what to say... We set out to do something. I'm not letting our broship fall to the pandi just yet. Mrs. Nelson? We're here! We got your vaccination for you, Mrs. Nelson. I guess it is what's best for everybody. And I'll come pick you up on Thursday, Kenny.
