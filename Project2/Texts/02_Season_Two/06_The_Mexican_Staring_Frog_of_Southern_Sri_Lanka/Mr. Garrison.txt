"What's Vietnam?" A question a child might ask, but not a childish question. Heheheheheheheheheh. Children, for the next few days, we'll be learning all about Vietnam. Chances are that somebody in your own lives was affected by this incredible war. No, I wasn't in Vietnam, but sometimes, I like to ''pretend'' I was. Anyway, children, I'm going to assign you all a paper. I want you all to find somebody in your own life who was in Vietnam and interview them about it. Then you get an F, fail the third grade, and have to get a job cleaning septic tanks to support your drug habit. Yes.  Where the fuck did you hear this ridiculous load of bullshit? Well, boys, it's obvious to me that you didn't do your work, and that you stayed up all night thinking up some ridiculous lie. You all receive an F...minus. Stanley, the Vietnam War was ''war!'' There weren't galloping steeds or singing birds or log rides. Well, that's it! All of you have detention for the rest of the week!
