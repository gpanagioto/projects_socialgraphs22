 Alright boys! I'm really glad to see we have some new recruits interested in the fine sport of wrassling. Now, the first thing we're gonna learn today are the fundamental wrassling holds. Let's get some volunteers. Uh why don't come over here young man? What's your name? What? Okay uh, just go ahead and get on your hands and knees. Just, down on, down on the floor.  Alright and now how about you. Your name is? Uh, all right, uh cu, come on over here. I'm gonna position you in the official wrassling starting position.  Here- we- go. Now just reach around him here. Good. Get back on the floor! I'm teaching the starting position of wrassling! Oh, not this again! Let me guess: you just went to that stupid WWE show in Denver last night! Ugh.  Rrrgh!  It's all made up! Fiction! Real wrassling is a serious and respectable sport! Why can't you people understand that that kind of wrestling isn't real?! Look look look!  You're firing me? Why?! No, this isn't wrassling! THIS ISN'T WRASSLING! Principal Victoria, just let me stay on and I can teach kids what real wrassling is! You can't fire me for what these kids do! What do you mean?
