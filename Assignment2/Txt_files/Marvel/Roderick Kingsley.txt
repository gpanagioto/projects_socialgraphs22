'''Roderick Kingsley''' is a [[fiction]]al [[Character (arts)|character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Originally created by [[Roger Stern]] and [[Mike Zeck]] for ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man#Volume One (1976–1998)|Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #43 (June 1980), the character was later brought back in the [[1997 in comics|1997]] storyline ''[[Spider-Man: Hobgoblin Lives]]'', in which he was revealed as the first and most prominent incarnation of the [[supervillain]] '''[[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]]''', created by Stern and [[John Romita Jr.]] in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #238 (March 1983), and previously revealed to be the [[Assassination|assassinated]] [[Ned Leeds]] in [[1987 in comics|1987]], the latter being [[Retroactive continuity|retroactively revealed]] to have been a [[Brainwashing|brainwashed]] [[patsy]] manipulated by Kingsley over the course of the ''Hobgoblin Lives'' storyline.

A conniving fashion designer in [[New York City]], Kingsley gained access to one of [[Norman Osborn]]'s lairs that housed the [[Green Goblin]]'s equipment. Kingsley upgraded the inventions and perfected the Goblin formula, which enhanced his physical abilities and intellect without insanity. Adopting a [[Halloween]]-themed appearance and an arsenal of weapons similar to that of his predecessor, including explosive "Pumpkin Bombs", razor-sharp bats, and a high-tech "Goblin Glider", Kingsley became the criminal mastermind known as the Hobgoblin. He has endured as one of the superhero [[Spider-Man]]'s most enduring enemies and belongs to the collective of adversaries that make up web-slinger's [[List of Spider-Man enemies|rogues gallery]].

In 2009, the Hobgoblin was ranked by [[IGN]] as the 57th-greatest comic book villain of all time.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/57.html |title= Hobgoblin is number 57 - IGN |publisher= Comics.ign.com |access-date= 2010-08-13 |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100809124321/http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/57.html |archive-date= 2010-08-09 }}</ref> The character has been featured in various media adaptations, such as [[television series]] and [[video game]]s.

==Publication history==
[[File:Roderick Kingsley's debut.png|thumb|upright|left|Roderick Kingsley made his debut in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #43 (June 1980). Art by [[Mike Zeck]]. Spider-Man's precognitive "spider-sense" mysteriously alerted of what appeared to be an ordinary and weakly stranger.]]
Roderick Kingsley made his first appearance in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man#Volume One (1976–1998)|Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #43 (June 1980) and was created by [[Roger Stern]], [[Mike Zeck]] and [[John Romita Jr.]]<ref>''[[Marvel Age]]'' #111, April 1992, [[Marvel Comics]]</ref>

The Hobgoblin's identity was not initially revealed, generating one of the longest-running mysteries in the ''Spider-Man'' comics.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Manning |first2=Matthew K. |title=Spider-Man Chronicle: Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging |date=2012 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-0756692360 |page=114}}</ref> According to Stern, "I plotted that first story with no strong idea of who the Hobgoblin was. As I was scripting those gorgeous pages from JR [John Romita Jr.], particularly the last third of the book, and developing the Hobgoblin's speech pattern, I realized who he was. It was Roderick Kingsley, that sunuvabitch corporate leader I had introduced in my first issue of ''Spectacular''".<ref name="Back35">{{cite journal|last= Greenberg|first= Glenn|author-link= Glenn Greenberg|date= August 2009|title= When Hobby Met Spidey|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= #35|pages= 10–23|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref> A handful of readers deduced that Kingsley was the Hobgoblin almost immediately. In order to throw readers off the scent and provide a [[retroactive continuity|retroactive explanation]] for his inconsistent characterization of Kingsley in his early appearances, Stern came up with the idea of Kingsley having his brother Daniel Kingsley sometimes impersonate him, sealing the deception by having the Hobgoblin appear in the same room as Kingsley in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #249.<ref name="Back35"/>

Stern's original plan was to have the mystery of the Hobgoblin's identity run exactly one issue longer than that of the Green Goblin's identity, meaning the truth would be revealed in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #264.<ref name="Back35"/> However, Stern left the series after ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #252, and [[Tom DeFalco]] his successors felt Kingsley was a weak choice for the Hobgoblin's true identity.<ref name="Back35"/> Thus, the Hobgoblin was ultimately unmasked as [[Ned Leeds]] in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #289 (after considerable creative struggle over the issue), and [[Jason Macendale]] took over as the Hobgoblin.<ref name="SpideyKicksButt">{{cite web |url=https://www.spidermancrawlspace.com/2020/05/squandered-legacy-the-rise-and-fall-of-the-hobgoblin-part-two-the-goblin-in-decline/ |title=Squandered Legacy: The Rise and Fall of the HobGoblin Part Two: The Goblin in Decline |author= Fettinger, J.R. |access-date=2009-02-19 |work= Spidey Kicks Butt }}</ref>

Stern was unhappy with the revelation that the Hobgoblin's civilian identity was Leeds and wrote the three-issue miniseries ''Spider-Man: Hobgoblin Lives'' in 1997, with the [[retcon]] that Kingsley was the original Hobgoblin and had brainwashed Leeds as a [[fall guy]]. Stern followed up the miniseries with the ''Spider-Man'' storyline "Goblins at the Gate", which resulted in Kingsley and [[Norman Osborn]] being bitter rivals obsessed with each other's destruction over the [[Goblin (Marvel Comics)|Goblin]] legacy, although Leeds would later be retconned further by a different writer to have also been a willing Hobgoblin.{{clear left}}

==Fictional character biography==
Roderick Kingsley started out as a socialite, [[fashion design]]er and billionaire who had criminal underworld connections and had come about his wealth through unethical business practices and corporate raiding. Coincidentally, Kingsley was an employer of [[Mary Jane Watson]] for a time.<ref name="CrusherHogan">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Tom DeFalco|DeFalco, Tom]] | penciller = [[Ron Frenz|Frenz, Ron]] | inker = [[Josef Rubinstein|Rubenstein, Josef]] | story = Whatever Happened To Crusher Hogan? | title =The Amazing Spider-Man | issue = #271 | volume = 1 |date = December 1985| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> As a means of avoiding the drill of day-to-day appearances, he had his timid [[identical twin]] brother [[Daniel Kingsley]] pose as him to run his corporation.<ref name="Hobbylives1">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Roger Stern|Stern, Roger]] | penciller = [[Ron Frenz|Frenz, Ron]] | inker = [[George Pérez|Pérez, George]] | story = Victims | title = Hobgoblin Lives | issue = #1 |date = Jan. 1997| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> Kingsley's activities gave him many enemies, one of which was [[Bella Donna (comics)|Bella Donna]] (Narda Ravanna), a rival fashion designer whose business he had ruined and attempted revenge on Kingsley but is twice thwarted by [[Spider-Man]].<ref name="Bella1">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Roger Stern|Stern, Roger]] | penciller = [[Mike Zeck|Zeck, Mike]] | inker = Mitchell, Steve | story = Pretty Poison | title = Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man | issue = #43 |date = June 1980| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref><ref name="Bella2">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Roger Stern|Stern, Roger]] | penciller = [[Marie Severin|Severin, Ron]] | inker = Patterson, Bruce | story = A Night on the Prowl! | title = Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man | issue = #47 |date = Oct. 1980| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref><ref name="Bella2a">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Roger Stern|Stern, Roger]] | penciller = [[Marie Severin|Severin, Marie]] | inker = Patterson, Bruce | story = Double Defeat! | title = Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man | issue = #48 |date = Nov. 1980| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>

After these incidents, Kingsley seeks to protect himself and his empire by gaining more power. The thug George Hill reports to Kingsley of stumbling upon [[Norman Osborn]]'s secret lair in hopes of earning a reward. Kingsley instead kills Hill to make sure that no one else gets wind of the discovery.<ref name="Shadow">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Roger Stern|Stern, Roger]] | penciller = [[John Romita Jr.|Romita, John Jr.]] | inker = [[John Romita Sr.|Romita, John Sr.]] | story = The Shadow of Evils Past! | title = The Amazing Spider-Man | volume =  | issue = #238 |date = March 1983| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> Upon examining the lair and gleaning its secrets, Kingsley decides to use the Goblin equipment.

With Donovan having administered the Goblin formula and then in the Hobgoblin costume to fight Spider-Man, Kingsley monitored his pawn's vital signs and behavior from a distance. When Spider-Man overwhelms and unmasks Donovan and the brainwashing begins to fail, Kingsley acts to protect his identity by programming Donovan's [[Goblin glider|glider]] to crash into a building, instantly killing Donovan.<ref name="Ordeals"/><ref name="Sacrifice">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Roger Stern|Stern, Roger]] | penciller = [[John Romita Jr.|Romita, John Jr.]] | inker = [[Dave Simons|Simons, Dave]] | story = Sacrifice Play! | title = The Amazing Spider-Man | volume =  | issue = #245 |date = Oct. 1983| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> Judging the experiment a success, Kingsley immerses himself in his completed formula derivative and gains greater strength than the original Goblin.

As Leeds gets too erratic to function as a decoy, Kingsley arranged for Leeds to be assassinated by [[Jason Macendale]] and the [[Foreigner (character)|Foreigner]] while on a trip to Berlin, and decided to retire from the Hobgoblin identity.

During the events of ''[[Secret Wars II]]'', Kingsley is recruited by [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] to join the Legion Accursed, a team of ninety-nine supervillains who try to destroy the [[Beyonder]].<ref name="DarkBrigade">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Jim Shooter|Shooter, Jim]] | penciller = [[Al Milgrom|Milgrom, Al]] | inker = [[Steve Leialoha|Leialoha, Steve]] | story = Charge Of The Dark Brigade! | title = Secret Wars II | issue = 7 |date = January 1986| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> The Hobgoblin later kidnaps [[Harry Osborn]].

After a retirement of several years, Kingsley returns to New York.

Roderick is taken to prison, imprisoned in the same cell where he killed Macendale.<ref>''Spider-Man: Hobgoblin Lives'' #3 (March 1997). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Furious at Norman's return and denial of being the Goblin, Kingsley spreads rumors that there exists a secret journal of Osborn's that proves beyond a doubt of being the Goblin, but this was later revealed to be a ruse, knowing Osborn has been sending spies on him: all of the journals in his possession had been destroyed during a battle with Spider-Man years before.<ref name="Confessions!">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Roger Stern|Stern, Roger]] | cowriters = | penciller = [[John Romita Jr.|Romita, John II]] | inker = [[Klaus Janson|Janson, Klaus]] | story = Confessions! | title = The Amazing Spider-Man | issue = #250 |date = March 1983| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> He offers to barter this information, for his freedom, with the District Attorney, guessing that Osborn will try to get to him first. Osborn, deciding to make a deal with Kingsley, breaks him out of prison. Kingsley is then confronted by both Osborn and another Green Goblin.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #259 (July 1998).

Marvel Comics.</ref> Osborn knew Kingsley was lying about the journal and has bought Kingsley's company out from underneath him; the purpose of helping Kingsley escape is for Osborn to eliminate the one person who possibly can prove that Osborn is the Goblin personally. Kingsley furiously attacks Osborn who is shocked to discover that Kingsley is stronger and thus fails at killing him. The building began to burn as a result of their battle, and Spider-Man escapes with Daniel. All three of the villains managed to escape as well. With several million dollars hidden away in foreign bank accounts, Kingsley quietly moves to a small island in the Caribbean to enjoy his retirement.<ref name=SS-M#261>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #261 (Sept. 1998).

Kingsley is seemingly killed by [[Phil Urich]] who takes on the Hobgoblin mantle,<ref name=philurichhobgoblin>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #649. Marvel Comics.</ref> but this was in fact Daniel with Roderick still active in Ecuador under the alias of '''Devil-Spider'''.

Kingsley and Urich decide to call a brief truce and go after them.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #696 (Oct. 2012). Marvel Comics.</ref> After accessing the warehouse, Peter utilizes the Goblin tech to make himself a "Spider-Glider" and manages to escape. Urich insists on going after but Kingsley stuns Urich with a taser so they can both escape. Kingsley decides to let Urich remain the Hobgoblin, but only if Urich gives him a cut of whatever profits are made.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #697 (Nov. 2012). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Kingsley obtains one of [[Mysterio]]'s suits which he sells to a criminal who takes on the name Mysterion.<ref>''Avenging Spider-Man'' #26. Marvel Comics.</ref> He sells the [[Crime Master]]'s gear to an unnamed [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]] operative.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #22.

During the "[[AXIS (comics)|AXIS]]" storyline, Kingsley appears as a member of Magneto's unnamed supervillain group during the fight against the [[Red Skull]]'s [[Onslaught (Marvel Comics)|Red Onslaught]] form. When Magneto arrives to recruit him, Kingsley attacks and is subjugated and forced to join Magneto's team.<ref>''Magneto'' vol. 3 #11. Marvel Comics.</ref> Kingsley accompanies Magneto and the other villains recruited to Genosha.<ref>''Avengers & X-Men: AXIS'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> The inversion spell caused by [[Doctor Doom]] and Scarlet Witch affects not only the Red Skull but all those present in Genosha, making the superheroes present evil and the supervillains present good. Following his inversion, Kingsley returns to New York and finds himself happier with his inversion, although still motivated by greed rather than altruism. He reactivates his franchises where he leases the personas and costumes of deceased or retired superheroes to ordinary people, but remains a wanted criminal. He also enfranchises his Hobgoblin persona to various people to perform heroic deeds as Hobgoblin and publishes a comic about the group for promotion. Among those who answer an ad are the amnesiac [[Menace (Marvel Comics)|Lily Hollister]] and the underemployed teenager John Myers. Other attendees include a different [[Demolition Man (comics)|Demolition Man]], Flower Girl, Leather Boy, a new [[Razorback (comics)|Razorback]], and a new Water Wizard. He sets a three phase program including a book and various articles with his brand and underground speeches named after Ned for people to make their own franchises in exchange for a share of their profits.<ref>''AXIS: Hobgoblin'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Kingsley debuts his Hob-Heroes: Lily as Queen Cat, Myers as Missile Mate, Flower Girl, Leatherboy, Rocket Head, and Water Wizard. When the second Goblin King confronts Kingsley in his headquarters, Myers is convinced by Urich's claims that Kingsley will soon abandon the heroes he has trained. Missile Mate goes to Urich's headquarters and asks to join to be a supervillain. Urich is reluctant, but Myers shows also gathering all the supervillains Kingsley "abandoned" after being a good guy.<ref>''AXIS: Hobgoblin'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> When the celebration of a "Hobgoblin Day" is being held with a parade in Kingsley's honor, Missile Mate betrays Kingsley and attempts to murder him in the Goblin King's name. Kingsley has already expected the betrayal and has been using a hologram decoy which takes Missile Mate's blow. As soon as Kinglsey confronts Missile Mate, Urich appears with the Goblin Nation and attacks the celebration. Kingsley bests Urich in combat and leaves his rival to the authorities. After, he is approached by Steve Rogers to be part of a team of Avengers with the objective to stop the inverted X-Men from detonating a gene bomb which would kill everyone on the Earth who wasn't a mutant.<ref>''AXIS: Hobgoblin'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Avengers team that Kingsley joins is called the Astonishing Avengers.<ref name="Avengers & X-Men: AXIS #6"/> After the reinversion spell is cast to restore the Avengers and X-Men members that were affected by it back to the side of good, Kingsley is evil again.<ref>''Avengers & X-Men: AXIS'' #9. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Kingsley starts to get his old franchises back under control. Outside of recruiting [[Blizzard (Marvel Comics)|Blizzard]], Kingsley regains his former minions Beetle, Bruin, Hitman, Ringer, and Unicorn as well as establishing his versions of [[Cutthroat (comics)|Cutthroat]], [[Diamondback (Rachel Leighton)|Diamondback]], [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]], and [[Viper (Marvel Comics)|Viper]]. When franchisee [[Porcupine (comics)|Porcupine]] informs him of an intent to end the contract, Kingsley tries to kill with a Pumpkin Bomb in order to reclaim said suit for future franchisees.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' vol. 6 #13. Marvel Comics.</ref> In the resulting battle with Porcupine and crimefighting mentor [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]], Kingsley is taken down by [[Carol Danvers|Captain Marvel]].<ref>''Spider-Woman'' vol. 6 #16.

Kingsley turns up as a member of the Sinister Six led by the [[Prowler (Marvel Comics)|Iron Spider]]. He accompanies the Sinister Six in a plot to steal a decommissioned S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier.<ref>''Spider-Man'' #234. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers, abilities, and weaknesses==
Roderick Kingsley initially had no superhuman abilities, but possessed a keen analytical intellect with enough knowledge of chemistry and biology to understand Mendel Stromm's notes regarding the Goblin formula. Kingsley not only recreated the formula but perfected by removing side-effects. Further, he updated many of Osborn's various Goblin inventions. With a technological means developed by [[List of Spider-Man enemies#Brainwasher|Brainwasher]], Kingsley can control the human mind through hypnosis and programming, typically to create stand-ins for himself. Kingsley was skilled in the management of both criminal organizations and legally run professional businesses. Due to his green chemical solution exposure, Kingsley possesses superhuman strength on par with Spider-Man<ref name="Hobbylives1"/> and stronger than Osborn (due to its improvements and duration of Kingsley's exposure was longer). Likewise, his reflexes, speed, stamina, and intellect were also enhanced to superhuman levels. As the Hobgoblin, he wore bulletproof mail with an overlapping tunic, cape, and cowl. A computerized system cybernetically causes the finger-blasters to randomly vary their attack vectors when trained on a particular target. He uses a [[Goblin glider]], a one-man miniature turbo-fan-powered vertical thrust, cybernetically-controlled vehicle. It can reach high velocities and is extremely maneuverable. He uses concussion and incendiary Jack O'Lanterns, wraith-shaped smoke and gas-emitting bombs, bat shaped razor-edged throwing blades, and gloves woven with micro-circuited power conducting filaments which channel pulsed discharges of electricity. He wore a shoulder bag to carry his small, portable weaponry.

==Notes==
{{reflist|group=Note|refs=
<ref name=Note01>Roderick Kingsley had yet to be revealed as the original Hobgoblin in the comics when ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'' was produced, so the show's version of the character was instead an [[Composite character|amalgamation]] of Roderick Kingsley's/Ned Leeds' personality and ambitions with [[Jason Macendale]]'s name and mercenary background.</ref>
