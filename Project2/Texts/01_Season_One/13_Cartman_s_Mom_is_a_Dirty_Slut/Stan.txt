Dude! The bus will be here any minute, and Cartman didn't show up for school. Maybe we should ditch school and go check on him. We're not getting on, you fat ugly bitch! I said: We're not getting on, you fat ugly bitch. I always wondered if that would work. In the backyard?  Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here. No, dude. This look really serious. I think we'd better get help. Nono. We saw him having a tea party with his stuffed animals. No. Is that legal? Dude, this is going to be the funniest tape ever made. I donnow, just keep rolling. Wow, check it out, dude. We have to remember to tape ''Not Without My Anus'' next week! Come on Grandpa. We wanna watch ''Terrance and Phillip''. Aaawww. This guy sucks! Cartman? What the hell are you doing dressed up like an Indian with a bear necklace? What?? What are you talking about, Cartman?! Go ahead, dude. Yeah. We'd better get this videotape over to Mr. Mackey, quick! Come on, Kenny, get the go-cart going. I wanna ride it. Yeah. I mailed it last night. What sucks is that now I'll have to actually watch that Bob Saget guy to find out if we won.  Shhh! Here comes Cartman. Cartman?! Dude, I thought you said you were Native American. Dude. We should be videotaping ''this''. We could make ''another'' $10,000. Oh my God, they've killed Kenny. Huh?  Oh yeah. How 'bout some ice cream? Oh, yeah! We're gonna be in the finals! Man! Cartman's gonna be famous!  Dude! I can't wait to win that $10,000 on ''America's Stupidest Home Videos''. I'm gonna buy the coolest go-cart ever. How's it going, Cartman? Come on, what's the matter, Cartman? Wow. We're sorry your mom's a whore, dude. Yyeah. We have a videotape that's in the finals for ''America's Stupidest Home Videos'', and... if we win, we'll give you - 3000 of out $10,000 prize. Uh, yyeah. Uuh, you'll see. We're sure to win, Cartman.
