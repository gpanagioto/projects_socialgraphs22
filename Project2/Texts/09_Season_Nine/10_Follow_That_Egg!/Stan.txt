 Oh no, dude, he's gonna put me with Wendy. So, I haven't even spoken to Wendy since we broke up. Kyle?? So, what are you and Wendy doing? Uh huh... Yeah, well, so is your hat.  I can't. I'm busy. ...So take it with you!  Well, maybe I didn't want to have an egg with you, okay, Bebe?!  HA!  Alright, give it to me. I'll take it home tonight.  Why do you say that? That's because I was pissed off! You think you're so great, don't you?! Well guess what?! Maybe ''I'' don't need ''your'' help! I'm taking the egg home tonight, and I'm gonna show everybody tomorrow that I'm every bit as good an egg-take-care-over as you!   Fine! No problems at all! It's right there, see?  Day five. I made it!  Hello? What? Governor's office? Aah, you'd like that, wouldn't you?! I took care of this egg, Kyle, not you! What's up?! Oh, nothing except that you've been trying to impress Wendy all week long like a pathetic dickhole! You've set it all up to look like you're this awesome prince and I'm just a loser! Well guess what?! I'm gonna take this egg to class myself! And I'm gonna hold it up in front of Wendy, and say "See?! I'm every bit as good as Kyle is."  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!  Dude, you should just go be with Wendy and be happy. Yeah well, I blew it. Now we're gonna fail and Wendy thinks I'm a total loser. I don't. She's totally lame.   I'm sorry I didn't trust you, Kyle. I'm obviously just a crappy best friend to have. Huh? That...  That's the real egg with Garrison's signature? Then... then Wendy ''won't'' think I'm a total loser! Come on, buddy, let's go!   There! Over there!  Excuse us! Excuse us please! Jesus Christ!
