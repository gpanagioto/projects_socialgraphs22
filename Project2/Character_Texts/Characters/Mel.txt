Yes? You can't not like ''The Passion''! I just followed the Bible! Christ died for you. Go home.  Oh yeah? Well you're gonna have to find it first.  You can torture me all you want, I still won't tell you!  You still won't get your ticket money back! I can take whatever you can dish out! I get it, but you don't have a choice, is that it?! Well go ahead! I just sure hope you don't use those whips over there on the wall!  Jesus, oh how I love ya, how I love ya Jesus! How dare you call me crazy! This means war!  Two days ago, I saw a vehicle that would haul that tanker. You wanna get outta here? Talk to me.  Freedom!  Jesus is Lord!  ''When you're a clown, nobody takes you seriously!''  K'plagh! K'plagh! ''And good evening, frieeeeeeends!'' Give me back my money!   Haaaa! K'Plaaaa! Give me my eighteen dollars! Ha!  Oh, my nipples are so tender! Don't squeeze them anymore!  I'll bet you wanna torture me now, don't you?! You! You would all love to torture me, wouldn't you?  Okay, fine. See what you can fit in there, I can take it!  Fine! If nobody here is man enough to torture me, then just give me my eighteen dollars! You ''can't'' say my movie sucked, or else you're saying Christianity sucked! Woohoohoo! Woohoohoohoohoo!
