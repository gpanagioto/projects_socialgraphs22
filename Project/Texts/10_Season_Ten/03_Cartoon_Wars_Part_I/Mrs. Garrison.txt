It's okay!  Welcome to Muslim-Sensitivity Training. It is important for us to understand why the Muslim feel the way they do, and why we can never show an image of Mohammad. Kyle, you're not being very sensitive. Let's all look at ''why'' Muslims are upset:  Now put yourself in the shoes of a Muslim. It's Friday night, but you can't have sex, and you can't jack off. There's sand in your eyes and probably in the crack of your ass, and then some cartoon comes along from a country where people ''are'' getting laid, and mocks your prophet. Well you know what? I'd be pretty pissed off too! Why would they-?  Who are those people?
