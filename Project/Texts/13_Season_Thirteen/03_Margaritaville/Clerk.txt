Hello young man, welcome to Sur la Tahbluh. Can I help you? Oh, that's all we get anymore, returns. Could you please just put the receipt here on this tahbluh.  Sorry, our computers are a little slow today. We need a new Ethernet cahbluh. Oh, I'm sorry, sir, I'd like to give you a refund but I'm afraid it's not doahbluh. I said I'm not ahbluh, sir. You see, this Margaritaville was purchased with a payment plan? Well an outside financing company handles those payment plans. Customers just pay for some of the machine and the finance company pays for the rest.
