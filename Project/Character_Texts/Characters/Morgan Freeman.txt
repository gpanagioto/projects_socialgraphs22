 Chapter 2... "Why are we here?" Douglas cried as poop came out his wiener, in a long, thin strip. It was... wiener poop, which is the grossest poop of all. 
 You see, when the United States created ''Star Wars'' it made this country incredibly powerful.  Earlier this week, Lucas signed the rights to ''Star Wars'' over to Disney, and the Chinese saw a way to obtain it for themselves. The Chinese government knew that President Obama would help them take the rights from Disney if they helped him get reelected. But the child who actually stole the ballots has hidden them, and won't give them to anyone until his demands are met. You've all got quite a mess on your hands. I wish you well with it.  Because every time I show up and explain something, I earn a freckle.   You see, it turns out the only reason the Chinese so desperately wanted ''Star Wars'' is because they're afraid that Disney might not be the right place for it. The Chinese simply want to guard ''Star Wars'' impeccable legacy. And now we're at a crossroads. If these ballots are made public, then the man the people voted for will be President, but he will no doubt keep ''Star Wars'' from the Chinese, and allow Disney to keep it instead. And so we have to ask ourselves, "What's more important? That the right man is elected President, or that ''Star Wars'' is with people who will protect it most?"
