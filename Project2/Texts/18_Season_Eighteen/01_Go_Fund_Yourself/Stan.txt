Pungent crotch sweat. Pungent milk- milky crotch spooge. Nah.  Uh huh. Angry Clit Spasm Whooping Fart Balls. Lubricated Titty Burgers.  Indifferent Rectal Semen Splooge! Dude, we're not gonna get any attention with that name. No. Dad, we don't need school anymore. We're forming a startup company. No, we don't wanna do anything. ...Nnnno, there isn't.  What? I'm pretty sure that's taken, Cartman.  I like it!  You alright dude? What?!  I don't know, I... But I don't know if my future is with this company either. Yeah... I just... never saw myself owning a company called "Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly on the Table, INC." Why don't we just call it "Untitled Startup Company"? Yeah, I know that. But a good company should never have seven words in its title. I just feel that somewhere out there, there's a perfect startup company name. And I need to be free to go find it. Good luck with your company, dude. It doesn't matter, you guys. There's something a lot more important here.  Do you guys remember when we first decided to start a company together? We all had a common goal. And we weren't gonna let anything stop us from getting to the bro down. But somewhere between starting up and selling out we... we lost our way. We can't do this on our own. We need each other. And we always said that all we needed was a sweet name and the rest would figure itself out, Boy, this is the life, huh guys? But you all thought our name was sweet.
