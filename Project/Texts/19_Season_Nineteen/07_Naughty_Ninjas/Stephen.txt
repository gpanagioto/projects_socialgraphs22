 It's ISIS! They're these troubled kids who've turned their backs on America! They've taken over SoDoSoPa, forced all the homeless out! They're just bad kids! Rotten on the inside! Probably with shitty parents! I'm pretty sure the police will help out if it's because ISIS is taking over the town.  Officers, there's kids in town who have joined ISIS. We don't know who they are, but they-. That is not true! Who said that? Look, Barbrady, the fact is, the town needs you.
