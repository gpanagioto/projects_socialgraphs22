Pfaha, so funny.  Yeah. We won't have to take crap from ''anybody''. Who's gonna tell them, dumbass?! I'm gonna get those killer sai.  for a dollar ninety nine. Parents? Parents?!  Why?!  Giya! Shut up, hippies! I'll kill you!  Iya!  Yes. And I... am Bulrog. Tough brute ninja who has dedicated his life to eradicating the world of hippies. Kick ass!  Hey, you guys, you know what we should do? We should go show our weapons to Craig and those guys. They'll be so jealous. Ech! You see, guys? This is why Jews can't be ninjas! They've got no spine! Oh yeah?! My mom took me to see Mel Gibson's movie, ''The Passion'', and Mel Gibson says you are sneaks and you are liars. And if the Road Warrior says it, it must be true. Yes. The residence of the one called... Craig.   Look what we got.  Ooo, is that jealousy I see in your eyes, Craig? Mmm, yes, drown me in the sweet water of your envy. Ugh. Yes. The life of a ninja is complex and full of peril.  Come on, ninjas! Aw man, did you see the look on Craig's face?! That was awesome! We're playing Ninjas, Butters. No, Butters. We are a very select elite fighting team sent to protect the world from evil, and you can't play with us. Yes, and no time to do it. No time...  Hold on you guys. I actually have another power. I can see into the future too, but better than Kyle. Let me try it. I am Bulrog and I have lots and lots of powers. I have the power to have all the powers I want.  C'mon! Looks like we have a sworn enemy, you guys. That's bullcrap! Titanium alloy my ass! All right, dickhole! Time for you to pay!  Oh no! I have no powers! Kyle took them away from me! Quick, Kyle, give me back my powers so I can fight this evil villain! All right! And now I will use my power to...  Ha, ha, ha, ha, haaa, ha! Now you are a chicken! Nyanyanyanyanyaaa nya! Oh, shit, dude! Guys, meeting over here for a second?  All right you guys, we need to stay calm and just do the right thing. We have to kill Butters and bury him in Kyle's backyard. Go ahead and scramble it, then he won't remember it was us.  Now, come on guys, sure, it's easy to be a ninja when everything's going your way, but it's times like these, when the chips are down, that a ninja shows his true character. Shut up, Butters.  Dr. Shafley? So if we make Butters up to look like a dog... Hand me the modeling glue. We need more fur over here.  Butters! We're trying to help you, Goddamnit! Now, stop being such an asshole! Okay, let's hear your bark, Butters. Now remember, Butters, when you get to the vet's office, you need to stay down on all fours and- Butters, listen! At the vet's office, you need to stay down on all fours and bark a lot. In here!  No way, you got weapons too?! Aw man, now every douchebag in town has a weapon! Lame!  We're twice the ninjas ''you'' fags are! Very well, Clyde. Kiyaaaa! Butters! Ye-yeah, a little- Butters! Get back here ''right now''! We're in this together, Craig! If Butters tells on us, we're gonna tell on you! That's the ninja code! Here, Butters! Butter- Butters! Here, Butters!  Screw that, dude, I paid twenty bucks for these things! Okay. Go ahead, Kyle. Throw your nunchucks away. If you can. But you know damn well that your Jewish blood won't let you. You can't throw away something you paid fifteen bucks for. Go ahead and try. Mel Gibson was right, Kyle. Right now the Jew in you is screaming "NO! Those cost money! Get your money back!" You know this to be true.  All right. Looks like I have to use my power of invisibility to get by. I told you, Bulrog has lots and lots of powers. Behold.  Here, hold this stuff for me. What? I told you it was a wardrobe malfunction.  Hey, fuck you, Kyle!
