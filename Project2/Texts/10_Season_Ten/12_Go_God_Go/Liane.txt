There you are, Eric. What are you doing here? When does it come out?  It's time for school. Eric, you're just going to have to be patient.  Eric, you're coming home right now! It's almost bedtime. If you sleep then time'll go by faster.  Whoa! Eric, get out of there.   You need to learn to be patient!
