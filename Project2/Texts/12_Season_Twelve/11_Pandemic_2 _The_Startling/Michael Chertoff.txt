What about the pan flute bands? Are they on their way to Guantanamo Bay? Have they been loaded onto the boats or not?! That was an order!  I am still in charge here! I want those pan flute bands on the boats to Guantanamo! And how are the efforts to contain all this going? Ah I'm sorry, I just thought of a funny joke. All right, get the jets ready. I need to get to Machu Picchu. Yes, I need to be taken to Machu Picchu! Have you lost your hearing?! Am I in charge or not?!  Wait here a minute.  What of your prophecy now?! Nothing can stop me!  No! How did you get here?! Shoot them! They're a Peruvian band that escaped. We must keep them contained. I said shoot them! Damn you Craiiig! You just don't ever stop, do you?!   Arrrgh. Dargh, no!
