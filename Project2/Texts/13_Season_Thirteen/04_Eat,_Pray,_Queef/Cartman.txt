Oh, man, I thought that day would never end. Dumb?! Phillip farted in somebody's face super hard! But you don't know who until this week's episode! No! No, nono, you're right, Bebe! Farts totally aren't funny.  Let's get to my house!!   Ah ah ah, that's my seat, Craig. It's my Goddamned house, now get your bitch ass on the floor!  What? What the fuck is this?! Dude! What the hell is this disgusting crap?! No! No! As a matter of fact, I will not hold! I've been on hold for thirty-five minutes! Well we want some Goddamned answers, that's what we want! Like why did you show that smut instead of the Terrance and Phillip conclusion, you asshole?! You wanna tell me what's funny about two women shooting air from their vagina into a man's face?! No! No! See, some of us were eating when you showed that! Clyde threw up on his way home! What makes you think you can put that kind of filth on television?!  You know that little kids could have been watching that?! What kind of network are you running there in Canada?! Don't call me buddy! I'm not your buddy!  And to that end, by resorting to filth and garbage, the Canada Channel has thusly... Yes, that's good. Hey Butters. How you holding up, man? We got you a present, Butters. I'll put it here on your nightstand 'cause none of us want to touch you since you got queefed on. You're going to be the face of queef abuse, Butters, so that we can make people open their eyes. Last week at our school, a girl queefed right into our friend's face. That is why we are here to tell you  it's not a joke. Sick! Stop it, lady! ''It's time for equality. We must give them the respect they deserve.''
