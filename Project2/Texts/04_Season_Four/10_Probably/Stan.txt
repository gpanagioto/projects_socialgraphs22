Let's go.   ...they've killed Kenny! Dude, if this guy's goin' to hell, who's gonna save us?  Don't you guys, um... persecrute our religious beliefs. What purpose does school have? The Bible says the only goal in this life is to praise God and get into heaven. There's no way God will want to send us to hell now. Wow, cool. Yeah! What? Kenny?!  What's he say? Dude, that seems kind of... weird. What worked? Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait. You mean that this whole thing has just been a way for you to make ten million dollars?  Well, what about going to hell and all that?! Dude, I am so disillusioned right now. Yeah!
