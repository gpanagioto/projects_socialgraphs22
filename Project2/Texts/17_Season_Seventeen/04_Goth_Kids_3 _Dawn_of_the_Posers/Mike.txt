Okay, uhhh, our main order of business is of course the Halloween social. We're still looking for volunteers to make the-  You've got a lot of nerve coming here! And you say she just showed up like this? Indeed. If there is some kind of black magic at work creating these monsters, then we will have to use our most powerful Vampiric abilities to stop it. Yes, my child of darkness. We must call upon the powers of the Vamp kids' most sacred entity, per se. Only he can help us in this darkest time. This calls... for a summoning. We call upon the creator of all that is dark! The godfather of Death and Despair! Edgar Allan Poe, your followers in darkness beg for your help!  We summon to the world of the living the great Edgar Allan Poe! Knower of all that is misery! Your children need special guidance! Per se. Edgar Allan Poe was the original Vamp kid. Yeah, oh yes! Hey! Oh, fuck off, Nightpayne. I feel like we're being watched.  Oh God! I'm starting to feel Emo. He said he was over this, and was gonna hang out at the Village Inn. Wait. Look!
