 Foundin' Fathers would kick all your asses! There! All finished. From now on, this is the pro-war side of town, and that's the unpatriotic side.  Hey everybody, this is never going to work. Don't you see? All this dividin' up the town, it's just ridiculous. What we really should be doing, is just beatin' the hell out of each other like we were.  That's bullcrap, Mayor! Our rally to support the war was set up months ago! Hey, if you don't like America, then you can git out! We'll trizzle the shizzle all over the hizzle! See? I told you they had your son. Yeah! Don't kid yourselves. These people have come out to ''support our troops'', right?!  Oh no you don't! We're doing our pro-war song first! Well excuse me if... <br><i>I'm a little bit country.</i> <i>I'm a little for supportin' our troops.</i> <i>I believe freedom isn't free.</i> <i>We must defend our country.</i> That's because the Founding Fathers would have supported the war! Yeah, but... if it weren't for all you guys protesting, why everyone around the world would hate the American people instead of just the President. <i>Hey I'm a little bit country</i> <i>I'll be the muscle of America</i> Come on up here, everybody!  We want to thank our guests, the pro-war people.
