Uh, Mr. Chef, sir? Uh, I still don't have a helmet. Yes, but, couldn't we rotate who doesn't have a helmet every week? Does it always have to be me? Oh. Aaaaaaaargh! Uh, Mr. Chef sir? Righto, but how about I use a helmet today, and one of the other children goes without? No um, I guess not. Uh, Mr. Chef, if Stanley doesn't show up, can I use his helmet?
