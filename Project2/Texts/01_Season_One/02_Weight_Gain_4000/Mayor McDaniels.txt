Kathie Lee Gifford in South Park! Oh my God! This is our chance to make a name for ourselves; to show that we're not just some piss-ant white-bread mountain town. Yes! If I can show just how much I turned South Park around, I could become a Senator. That's right, he's a black guy isn't he? Yes! And we can even have the children of South Park put on a little play. Kathie Lee loves children. Children, as you all know, Miss Kathie Lee Gifford will be in South Park to present the award to some kid for an essay. Whatever. Now, I'm going to have you luscious little youngsters do a play about the history of South Park. Mr. Garrison, I'm asking you to direct our little play. Who cares? Now kids, what's say we give it our South Park best! And who's our little prize winner again? How about we get in shape, huh? We want to look our best for the TV cameras don't we? Come on people. We've got to turn this place around. Hang up the lights, string up the banners, castrate the cows! Well Mr. Garrison, how is the little play going? Oh, please do. I'm dying to see it. Oh, don't they look adorable? Oh my God! Mr. Garrison, we can not have our children beating each other senseless in front of Kathie Lee Gifford. Mr. Garrison, this is not appropriate. Do you actually think Kathie Lee Gifford would enjoy this?!? Mr. Garrison, I am dismissing you from directing our play.  Where is she? Here she comes.  It is with great pride and honor that I'd like to welcome Mrs. Kathie Lee Gifford to South Park. ...And now, our very own South Park Elementary chef will sing a special song in honor of Mrs. Lee Gifford. WHAT?! What? Oh God! Uh, Thank you Chef, for that heartwarming song. Thank you Chef! And now, here to present the award for the environmental essay to our own, Eric Kauffman... ...is your favorite celebrity, and mine,  Kathie Lee Gifford! Nohoho nooo. Now I'll be stuck in this Podunk town forever, with all these stupid hick, redneck, jobless, truck driving idiots!
