And so, children, today we're gonna focus on American history, right Mr. Twig? What did you say?! I told you to never mention that name in my classroom again! Mr. Hat is a two-timin' whore, and now we all learn from Mr. Twig! That is enough! Mr. Hat is gone, and he isn't coming back, and I don't wanna hear it! Anyway, children, lets turn our history textbooks to page 105, which should be right after page 104... Stan? Are you paying attention? Well, then, Stanley. What did I just say? ...Well, okay. I suppose you were paying attention. Anyway, children, the Love Boat did go on for about eight years. They tried to bring it back recently, but it didn't work. Probably 'cause Robert Urich had to weigh... Stanley, are you passing notes to Kyle?! Don't lie, Stan. Lying makes you sterile. Stanley, if you think it's so important to keep interrupting my class, then why don't you come up to the front and read your note to Kyle for everyone to hear! Stanley Marsh, you come up here right now and read your note!
