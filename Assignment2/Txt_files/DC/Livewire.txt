==Fictional character biography==
===DC Animated Universe===
[[File:Livewire.png|thumb|120px|left|Livewire, in ''Superman: The Animated Series''.]]
Introduced in the ''Superman: The Animated Series'' episode "Livewire", '''Leslie Willis''' was originally a popular and controversial [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] radio [[shock jock]] who took cynical joy in attacking [[Superman]] during her broadcasts.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |last2=Pasko |first2=Martin |title=The Essential Superman Encyclopedia |date=2010 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=978-0-345-50108-0 |page=213}}</ref> Amidst a thunderstorm, Willis hosts a rock concert in honor of her third anniversary working as a shock jock in spite of the Metropolis authorities' public safety concerns. When Superman arrives to help the police break up the event, Willis gains support from her fans in attacking him until [[lightning]] strikes the stage, setting it on fire. Superman pushes Willis to safety as a second bolt of lightning electrifies a metal tower on the stage, but the electricity runs through his body and into a wire that Willis stepped on, electrocuting her and changing her appearance. After waking up in the hospital and seeing a news report that suggested Superman deliberately caused her transformation, she swears revenge against him and discovers she can manipulate [[electricity]]. She escapes from the hospital and confronts Superman, calling herself Livewire. As she battles him, she drains electricity from nearby electronic devices and takes control of the local media before fleeing to a hydroelectric dam, where he douses her in water. Willis is hospitalized once more, though [[Lex Luthor]] pays her hospital bills due to their shared contempt for Superman.

Following this, Willis forms a short-lived alliance with [[Parasite (comics)|Parasite]] in the episode "Double Dose" and a separate alliance with [[Harley Quinn]] and [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]] in ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'' episode "Girls' Night Out", only to be defeated by Superman in the former episode and by [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]] and [[Barbara Gordon|Batgirl]] in the latter.

In the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' two-part episode "Hereafter", Willis joins the [[Superman Revenge Squad]] to fulfill their eponymous goal, only to be defeated by the [[Justice League]]. As of the third season of ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', Willis joined [[Gorilla Grodd]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]].

====Superman Adventures====
Livewire appears in the ''[[Superman Adventures]]'' comics, which is based on the DCAU animated series. Throughout issue #5, "Balance of Power", the two-part "War Games" (#22–23), and the two-part finale (#65–66), "Power Play", she joins forces with [[Professor Hamilton]] to stop [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]] and eventually reforms.

===Comics===
{{primary sources section|date=November 2017}}
In ''Action Comics'' #835, [[Gail Simone]] and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] brought Livewire into the mainstream [[DC Universe]], in the same tradition as [[Harley Quinn]].

Much like the DCAU version of Livewire before she gained her abilities, she was also a shock jock. Going by the DJ name Leslie, her show was dedicated to bashing upon Superman every night, claiming that Superman was only saving people in the name of grandstanding and showing off. She also shows a disdain for fellow broadcaster Billy Batson, aka [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]]. Her career as a shock jock was cut short when the owner of the station, Miguel, decided to turn the station into a country station (a reference to popular real-world shock jock, [[Howard Stern]], who lost his first DJ job in a similar fashion). Miguel was also quite pleased that she was fired because his wife was saved by Superman.

Unlike the DCAU version of Livewire, she was born with the gift of controlling electricity. Enraged at the loss of her job, she went to the top of the station where she was struck by lightning. Absorbing a large amount of energy from the lightning bolt, her appearance changed to a chalk-white skin with blue hair. With that change, she decided that she would now take her revenge out on Superman.

Superman was weakened by his battle with the [[Queen of Fables]] in the previous issue and was unable to withstand Livewire's attacks. Now too weak to fight her directly he defeated her by cunning, shorting out her powers.

====Helping to save the world====
Livewire gets kidnapped along with most of the other Metahumans on Earth by a being dubbed the 'Auctioneer'.<ref>''Action Comics'' #842 (October 2006). DC Comics.</ref> This being scours the universe looking for unique items to acquire (often by theft) before selling them to the highest bidder. Livewire's unique powers allow her, Superman and several other captives to escape their containment fields. She teams up with [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]], Superman, the Veteran, [[Blue Jay (comics)|Blue Jay]] and other heroes in fleeing their situation and gaining intelligence.

A dampening field provides a psychological barrier against utilizing their powers. With the help of [[Mister Terrific (comics)|Mister Terrific]], who communicates through Livewire's natural electricity, the field is soon neutralized.

During the escape attempt, Livewire accidentally creates a link between the makeshift team and every single television on Earth. This proves hard to shut off. Soon, the team confronts the Auctioneer.<ref>''Action Comics'' #843 (November 2006). DC Comics.</ref> With great difficulty, Livewire gains control over the being's communication systems. Under Superman's suggestions, they threaten to broadcast the Auctioneer's entire database to every alien system possible unless he agrees to release the heroes and leave the Earth alone. He reluctantly does so and returns everyone to Earth. The entire adventure was seen on every Earth TV and due to the Auctioneer selling the dramatic story rights, on many alien planets as well.

During this story arc, she also shows that she is physically attracted to [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]].

In ''[[Teen Titans]]'' (vol. 3) #51, Livewire is shown to be under the control of [[Starro]].

She recently caused a blackout of Gotham City. However, she is easily defeated by [[Stephanie Brown (comics)|Batgirl VI]], who was wearing an insulated [[Batsuit]].<ref>''Batgirl'' vol. 2 #4 (January 2010). DC Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Brightest Day]]" storyline, Livewire is shown battling [[Wildcat (Ted Grant)|Wildcat]] after being possessed by the [[Alan Scott|Starheart]].<ref>''Justice Society of America'' vol. 3 #41</ref>

In the ''[[Superman: Grounded]]'' storyline, Livewire attacks [[Jimmy Olsen]] and takes hostages in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] to get the attention of Superman. Superman then puts a modified version of the suit he had to wear when he was briefly converted into an energy being on Livewire (who promptly changes the S-shield on it to an L-shield), which returns her power levels to normal. She is arrested, but does not receive a hard sentence as she only damaged property, no one was wounded, and Superman spoke on her behalf. [[Iron Munro]] also chooses to use his influence in the justice department to help. When asked by Jimmy why he would help Livewire, Superman says that, in America, everyone deserves a second chance.<ref>''Superman'' #711. DC Comics.</ref> With the help of Iron Munro and Serling Roquette, an employee of [[S.T.A.R. Labs]], Livewire is declared reformed. She and Munro are given signal watches as part of an ''ad hoc'' '[[Supermen of America]]' group that Superman recruits because he comes to understand he cannot be everywhere at once.<ref>''Superman'' #714 (October 2011). DC Comics.</ref>

====The New 52====
In 2011, "[[The New 52]]" rebooted the DC universe. Livewire appears as a member of the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]] after the events of the "[[Forever Evil]]" storyline.<ref>''Justice League'' (vol. 2) #30. DC Comics.</ref> She has previously faced against [[Superman]], who found himself unable to defeat her, since she is made of pure energy, and teamed up with [[Batman]] in order to do so.<ref>''Batgirl'' (vol. 4) #41. DC Comics.</ref> Her origin is later given in an issue of ''Batgirl'', where it is revealed that Leslie Willis was once a popular [[vlogger]] known for her pranks and makeup tutorials. During a stunt where she tried to reroute all the power in the city in order to spell out a dirty message that would be visible from space, she was accidentally electrocuted, granting her superhuman abilities.<ref>''Batgirl'' (vol. 4) #42. DC Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Livewire is a being of pure electricity able to absorb vast quantities from external sources. She can also manipulate electricity, including electric and magnetic fields, ionize the air around her, which the DCAU incarnation used to create her costume, and generate [[electrostatic discharge|lightning blasts]] of various intensities, with her strongest being able to weaken or stun Superman. She can transform her body into a living [[electric arc]] in order to travel through anything capable of conducting an [[electric current]], possess/control electronic devices such as computers, telecommunications networks, and an entire electrical grid. In the comics, as stated by Superman in ''Action Comics'' #843, Livewire has the ability to broadcast the energy she has stored in the form of a coherent signal (radio wave, etc.), without directing the energy at a target.

Due to her powers, her primary weakness is water, as even a small amount will cause her stored energy to go haywire unless she has stored up enough power. At this or any stage, Livewire would have to be completely drenched in water to be fully depowered. Additionally, [[silicon]] dust can also render her powerless due to its electrical resistance.<ref>''Batman: The Animated Series'' episode "Girls' Night Out"</ref> When drained of her electricity, she reverts to her solid form and cannot use most of her abilities until she absorbs a minimal amount of [[electric power]] from an appropriate source. However, even when depowered, she can direct the flow of free electricity from an exposed energy source to re-power herself.

In her self-titled ''Superman: The Animated Series'' episode, she demonstrated extraordinary strength while lifting a hydroelectric dam's power unit that she was draining at the time.
