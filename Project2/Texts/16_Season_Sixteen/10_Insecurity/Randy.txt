 Look, look, the thing is, do we tell Gerald, or do we just stay out of it? Oh, come on, he can't be trying that with all our wives? No, I think I'll uh, ...just hang out a little longer.   Oh, is that so?  Sure um... Chad, is it? Thad. Nice. You um, havin' a busy day? Yeah I'll bet.  Yeah, you too, Thad.  Hey Sharon, these came for you. Yeah, w-what are they?  You just... order stuff off of Amazon and you can't remember what? Yeah, sure, 'cause...  Stan, you got something from Amazon.  Ooohhh shit. How did you get rid of him?  How did you get rid of the milkman?  You said we wouldn't be prepared to get rid of him. How did you?  You should have left our wives alone. Now let's go for a drive. Oh no, pull in here. Oh, and then we'd miss out on all the fun!    Wouldn't be the only ones in your family completely in the dark. Huh? Nothing. Whoawhoa, wait, wait. What do you mean? And then I had to drive to Walgreens, Barnes & Noble AND Ace Hardware. I tell you, having to go around and buy stuff again sucks.  We scared him! We thought that'd be enough! This guy doesn't know when to quit!  Hello? Yeah, sorry, false alarm. Pass phrase is tickle me homo.  It's a joke.  Yeah, I'm thinking maybe Gerald's house is nicer than mine is. Yours? What? It's over. But you were wrong. We don't have to be afraid of Amazon. The only price to be paid for convenience is that we must be secure with ourselves.
