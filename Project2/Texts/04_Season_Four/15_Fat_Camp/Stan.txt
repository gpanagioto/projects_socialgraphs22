 I can't do it, dude. Too bad Cartman's missing this. He must be really sick.  That's so gross. I'll throw in five.  Eww-ho-hoo! He did it! Kenny's not feeling so good. That manatee spleen made him sick.  Well, at least you got it out of your system. Oh, you guys! You know, dude, there might be something ''to'' this. We knew he wouldn't make it. I don't believe it. Did you like the old one? We thought of it, Jesus. I mean, Kenny's the one that does it all, but we were the masterminds of the whole thing.  What's a prostitute? Chef, what's a prostitute? Hi Chef. Nice day, isn't it? Chef, what's a prostitute? Chef was just about to tell us what a prostitute is. Because Jesus told us that Kenny's a prostitute. Is he? Like what? No. Wow! This is Kenny's best show ever! Yeah, you've gotten lame since you got skinny. What's up?  You guys! It's Kenny! He's been arrested for prostitution in New York! For giving Howard Stern a hummer! I don't know! All I know is Kenny is in jail for at least three months! I ''know''!   Deal, druggie!  Oh my God, they've killed Kenny! ...Sort of.
