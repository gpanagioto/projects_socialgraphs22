Mom! MOOOM! Mom!  Seriously! Something wonderful has happened! Mom, look! The tooth fairy! I put a tooth under my pillow, and she gave me two dollars!  She's only given me a lousy quarter before!  Yeah! This is so tits! Oh, I mean, this is so cool! Heh, you can compound daily my ass with interest, Mom; I'm goin' to the toy store and buy me a skateboard!  Mom, you don't know what the tooth fairy wants me to do with this money, okay? You're not the tooth fairy! I'll see you later!  Aw, man, this is so tits!  Aren't you stoked?!  For one tooth. Well, that doesn't matter, because I have an idea that is totally tits. Look, I don't know why the tooth fairy's being so cool to me. Maybe she's hot for me. I don't know, but if we all chip in with teeth, then I can hide them under ''my'' pillow and we could get enough money to buy a  Sega Dreamcast. All we need is teeth.  Sega Dreamcast?  Alright! Kenny's in, you guys! Tits! I'll tell you why it has to be you, Kenny: because ''your'' family is poor, and therefore has bad oral hygiene, so your teeth are gonna fall out someday, anyway. If you think about it, you should actually be thanking us.  "Oh, thank you, guys." You're welcome, Kenny. How are we gonna get it from him? Hahahahahaha. Hey, you guys, I can see Kenny's pengling, hahahahahaha. Higher, you guys.   I am the tooth fairy, my child. Sure. Now I will leave you tidings under your pillow.  Ey! Do not open your eyes until morning.  Square in the nuts. Bull's eye! I love that song, Mom. Sing it again. Okay. Another tooth fell out today; I'm leavin' it for the tooth fairy. I know, huh? You guys! Oh my God, you guys! You're not gonna believe it! It's beyond rational thought, you guys!  Holy crap, you guys! I mean- Four dollars.  Do you what this means? Tih-  What the hell? Mom! You know, the tooth fairy forgot to bring me money last night! Call the police!  M- Mom? Yi- you're serious here. There really is no tooth fairy? How could-? How could you lie to me, Mother? Lie right to my face? How can I trust you?  Myself and Willikins Bear, of course.   There is no money. I know!  Oh, God, I don't even know how to tell you this.  My mom has been giving me the money all this time, and your parents are the ones who left you money. But now my mom has given us so much money that she's bankrupt, and we're poor, like Kenny.  Kyle, open your eyes, man! Man, I can't believe all our parents lied to us about the tooth fairy. No, man, that's just a TV show. What? That your parents lied to you, too? How? Oh, dude, that is tits! I mean, that is big fat ''Oprah'' tits right there! Yeah.  Wow, look at the size of these houses! Hey,  Got it.  What the-?  Yeah! You ripped off our idea! It's better than ''your'' dress! You look like a bad Jennifer Lopez nightmare! We were there first! Man, that is tits! Hm. Work for you, have my penis cut off. Work for you, have my penis cut off. Hm's see... Two percent, have my penis cut off.  Two percent- Yeah? Well, that ain't nothin' but a thang.  That's right. Keep the change, my man. Yeah, but you know, why do we need Loogie? We know how the trade works: why don't we do it ourselves and keep all the profit? Oh, what the hell is that little Pollack gonna do, huh? Come on, you guys. I say we create our own mob crime family! Sure, Kyle. So, you've brought me 400 lbs. of teeth from China.  How much? Can I ask you a question, Weasel?  Do you think I'm an idiot? These are ''cat teeth'', you sonofabitch! You trying to sell me 400 lbs. of cat teeth?!  What?! I ain't giving you crap! Kenny's not afraid of you!  Six hundred dollars, you guys! Come on, get your stuff together!  This is gonna be tits!  Will somebody take those books away from him? Hurry up, you guys. We've gotta get that sick kid's tooth fairy money before Loogie does.  Yeah, well, you're gonna have to wait a little bit longer, Billy, 'cause that 600 bucks is mine!  I got it! Kyle? Weh-well, uh, du-don't take it too hard, dude, uh. That's what grown-ups do.They lie. Lie right to your face. ...Tits. Ey! Don't call me fat, Tolkien! Yeah! Why don't you chicks go wash some dishes or get pregnant or something?! We'd kick your girlie ass in sledding! Tolkien, I swear to God, if you call me fat one more time  There!   Heh. Huh. Uh-oh.  I'm sorry, Mom.  I'm sorry, Tolkien. Oh, I sure do, Mr. Mackey. I mean, I feel really bad, uhh. What was I thinking?  See ya later. No way! ...What the hell is a hate crime? What? A federal offense? Oh no?? Uh, yes? He's a black kid that goes to my school? He is black. I did? No! I hate hippies! I hate hippies! I mean, the way they always talk about "protectin' the earth" and then drive around in cars that get poor gas mileage and wear those stupid bracelets - I hate 'em! I wanna kick 'em in the nuts!  Ey! Don't call me fat, asshole! No!  Kenny! Kenny, you have to get me out of town! They're gonna put me in jail for a hate crime! You have to take me to Mexico!  Calm down, Kenny! Do you still have that battery-powered toy truck you got last Christmas?! Well, come on! I don't have much time!  Damnit, Kenny! Can't this thing go any faster?! Huh-who's Romper Stomper? Uh... 'Cause I'm just like ''you'' guys. Uh-I'm one of you. Oh, uh, well, personally, I... uhuhuhuh, I... don't like ''Animaniacs''?  So we're friends now? Yeah, neither do I. Friends suck. Hey you guys. Well, it sucks balls. Whattaya think? A what? Wwhat's that? I'd love to eat a cake, you guys, but they don't let us take anything back to the cells from here  Look, that's not important right now! Did you guys bring the cigarettes? Just hand over the God-damned cigarettes! Look, if you guys want me back to win the sledding race,  then I need those cigarettes. Just pass them through these little drill holes here. That's what everybody does. I know. That's why I have to have them up my ass.  Shut up, you guys! It's not funny! Well, okay... here... l'see... Okay, guys, eh... If you'll excuse me, I must be going now.   Yes. They are safely concealed in the depths of my ass. Engh. Egh. Uuuh, stupid cigarettes.  Well, you spend eight years takin' a crap and then flushin' the toilet; it sorta becomes a reflex! Please, just help me bust out of here. Son of a bitch!  Here you go, God-damnit! Well, what the hell do you expect, huh?! Now I got your stupid game; tell me how to break out of here! But you said- I thought that- I want my Mo-omm  Mommy, I want my Mommy!  You will?  What's the matter? Uhokay.  Oh. Really? Yeah. I never really realized that until just now. Okay.  Oh. I can't take these.  Romper? You... well... I know you don't think you've... ever been anybody's friend, but, well, you're a friend to me. You'll never take us alive! We're going down together, pigs!   That's right! I'm back!  What the hell's wrong with Clyde? I hope I can adjust to life outside of the big house. Been on the inside for so long, I don't remember how to live on the outside. When a man is stripped of his freedom, degraded in the ways that I was, it's- Hey.  Yeah, and I'm not gonna take my ''friends'' for granted ever again. Do British people count as an ethnicity for hate crimes? Sweet. Hey, Romper Stomper. Well, that's not all. I snuck something in for you, too. You know how you told me you always wanted to see Disneyland?  Yeah! That's the Pirates of the Caribbean. Ugh. Hegh. Oh! Here comes Space Mountain-oh-uugh.  Ogh! Wait-   Please don't call on me. Please, Jesus, don't let him call on me. Phew!  Oh, please, God, don't let him call on me. Father in heaven, I beg of you- Oh, thank you Low-ord! Praise Jesus! Yeah, me too.  Hoo-ray. That's right. I got a bad case of ADD. No homework for me. That was awesuhome!  Hey guys, have you been takin' your Ritalin? No, dude, you gotta try it.  It makes you feel good. It really takes the edge off, man. You should try it.  Did you guys see that?  What kind of smartass thing would I say, Mr. Garrison? There you go.  Whah! I agree. You know what, you guys? We should go to the concert anyways and see Phil Collins. So it's decided: Phil Collins concert for all of us.  Yes, come with us. Come with uusss. Haaa, it's Christina Aguilera again!  <poem><i>You'll be inside of me...</i></poem> Huh? Oh no! Agh!  Get off me! Get off me! Somebody help!! Please?? Somebody get it off of me!! Get it off of me. Get off of me, Christina Aguilera! Alright?! Please! Hegh, hegh He doesn't want your dumbass umbrella, clown! Beat it!    Oho, we've reached fag factor 5, captain. Wha-what? Another gay guy in feathers?  Yeah, especially that second one from the left. She was fine! Not that second one from the left; she had it goin' ''on''!  Yeah. I could prance around in little tights and sing opera too, for ''that'' kind of cash. Yeah, Kenny, you have to sing better! What's going on? No way! The bitches from Cirque du Chebleu! But as soon as he starts singing better, we're all gonna make ''bank''!  This is totally awesome. Because now we can convince them to stay here, and now our circus will kick ass! Hooray! Yeah. America is sooo much cooler. In Romania they just oppress you and try to bring you down. Damn, we might be screwed.  Sheep-shearing contests!   Dude, what the hell happened? Huh? Take that!  Yeah, you suck, dude! Yeah! God, you guys are dicks! Yeah! Yeah, screw them! Okay, Stan, I'm gonna you... a UFO crash-landing card!  You can deny it, or cover it up.  It's "Investigative Reports with Bill Kurtis" funtime game. You have to decide if you deny it or cover it up. Okay, let's see what Bill Kurtis says.  Oh yeah?! Well, I'm gonna give you... AIDS!  I just gave you AIDS. Kyle has AIDS, and now loses 47 turns  God-damnit, poor people suck! Your family is already on welfare, and now they're gonna bring another kid into the world. Poor people are turning out babies, adding to the overpopulation, and they're expecting ''me'' to pay for it with ''my tax dollars''. ...You see.  Gaw, this is just what I've been talkin' about! I can't even re''late'' to you guys anymore because you're too immature! I've gotta start hanging out with friends that are a little more intelligent, and understand ...politics and stuff. It's just that... I'm up on this level up here . Nononono! Me h'myah  I've outgrown all my friends. I need to meet more mature people, Clyde Frog.  You see that, Clyde Frog? Tomorrow I'm gonna meet my first mature friend! Hi, are you Tony?  Yeah!   Wow, cool! Neato! Having older friends kicks ass, uh! You see, I've, I've really been having a tough time. I've kind of matured faster than my other friends ; we don't really relate anymore, and, and uh, alright uh, all my friends seem so childish now. Heh, yeah! That feels real nice! Thanks.  Huh?  What the hell just happened? Okay, we'll try this again.  Lemme see, how about this one?  Mister Hammerhead? Mr. Garrison?? You wanna be my friend? That's cool, we can hang out. What do you wanna do first? Why the hell does the FBI keep arresting all my friends? This ''has'' to be the work of Stan and Kyle! God, I ''hate'' those guys!  Alright, just what the hell do you guys think you're doing?! No! I mean, what the hell are you doing?! Why are all my mature adult friends being "mys-teriously" arrested, huh?!  I'll ''tell'' you why! Because ''you'' guys are jealous and can't handle the fact that you're immature, and so you've started a government conspiracy against me! Lardbut. Oh, that's so mature! Golly, I guess I was wrong about you guys, huh?! YES I AM!!  Dr. Mephesto, I need help.  You see, unfortunately I have matured faster than all my friends. I wanna hang out with older friends, but I can't find any, so I was wondering if you could genetically engineer some older friends for me. Damnit! But I wanna hang out with older guys! NAMBLA? Hokay, thanks, Dr. Mephesto!  Yes. I'd like to join your fine organization. Is that cool? Sure.  ...Sweet.  Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! I got into NAMBLA and you gu-uys didn't! Oh, no big deal. I just found a group called NAMBLA with adult members, and they ''all'' think that I'm sure mature they want ''me'' to be their new poster child is all.  Thanks, dude.  Really? Awesome! Oh. Well, sure. I have some friends who want to be mature,  excluding Stan and Kyle, of course. KIIICK ASS! Oh, Stan, Kyle, just the guys I wanted to see! My NAMBLA organization is having a ''very'' important benefit in ''my honor''. We're gonna have a big, mature party at this hotel, and I can invite all my mature friends that I want. And that means I'm gonna invite everybody! Except for ''you'' guys! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! Well, ''that's'' nice, 'cause you ''can't'' go. You ''can't'' go. No, you CAN'T go.  Hey, Clyde, Butters, check this out  Hey, what the hell are you guys doing here?! This is for mature people only! Hunh.  Well, I guess nowadays, they allow any old schmucks into NAMBLA.  Thank you. They're all over the place. Uuh, that's, that's fine. I know how to get us out. Well, look. Those perverts aren't going to rest until they've made love to one of us. Right? So,... somebody's just gonna have to go out there and... take one for the team.  Now, are you a team player or not?! Well, Butters, there is no I in "team." Just go, Butters. We're running out of time. Heh, he's such a dumba-a-ass. Well, what? Alright, alright, I'm sorry I almost got you guys all raped. There. No, I guess you guys will blossom into maturity someday. Just don't take too long.   Oh, sweet, dude. Substitute teacher.  Oh, hoho. Ow. Oh, huh. Oh, geez, you know, when you're laughin' so hard that the milk comes out your nose? Uh ho ho, man! Huh? Not with me, man.  But I don't want Kyle to get well. I hate Kyle. "Coming in for attack, Captain." Pipew, pipipew  Give me the space cruiser, Kenny. Come on, Kenny, you have to give me the subspace cruiser  so I can destroy the Gengrins on Crespus 5. No, mine. M'yah!  Yeah. Okay, mom. What's goin' on, guys? Oh-kay. Uh huh. Oh, I think I see where this is going.  Stan, why don't you just ask the question? <poem><i>'No no, no no, nono no!<br />Nonono, no no!</i></poem> Well, perhaps I could see my way to giving up a kidney. For a price. I don't know. How much is your life worth to you, Kyle? Yes, well, until then, I need about ten million dollars. What I intend to do with the money is not an issue, is it? I suggest you start looking for that money quickly. Kyle doesn't seem to have much time. Tick-tock. Tick-tock. Okay. Where were we, Kenny? Oh yeah.  "Quick, Captain, we must destroy the Gengrin across the fire." Give me the space cruiser. Give it, Kenny. M'yah! No! NO! Hip- hippies all around me. Help! Mommy! Huhuhippies!  Hippies. Hi-i-ippies. They're everywhere. They wanna save the earth, but all they do is smoke pot and smell bad. He-elp!   Oh, it's Stan and Butters! Trying to take my kidney, are you?!  Maybe so, but at least I was smart enough to wear a Kidney Blocker 2000! I do! I do care! Look how much.  Oohh, morning, hum, hmyeah. HWAA!  That son of a bitch!  Okay, asshole! Give me back my kidney! It's MINE! Not yours, MINE! Give it back right now, or there's gonna be HELL to pay! Thank you. And you'd better hope to God it still works, just like it did before. You see that?! That's MINE! My asshole friend Stan took my kidney, and I need it put back in!  Please. No. Because. It doesn't belong to Kyle, it belongs to me! It's MINE! Thank you.   Heh. Hey, what what's going on? Huh? Aarrrrrr! I am SO PISSED OFF!  I swear I'm gonna kill you guys!! Oh good, you got the crappy kidney. Thaaat's ri-ight. Nah-ah! I'm just a better debater than you guys! Yes, I do! Oh yeah?! Well, screw you guys, I'm going home!   It's okay, I'm here.  Yes. This is a difficult case. In order to win the debate, we will need to attack Stan and Kyle's credibility. That's how you win these things: attack your opponents' credibility!  Butters! Take some kids and go dig up whatever dirt you can on Kyle's past. I'm talkin' booby magazines, whatever. The rest of you, go get the goods on Stan! His mom grounded him once for setting something on fire. Let's find out what that something was, and then lie and say it was a puppy.  Mmmm. You're right. We'll need to look like we prepared a case, too, so that they look all the weaker. Good plan. Sooo, what's the issue again? Interesting. Aaand, what side are ''we'' on? Whoa! Calm down, ho.  I warn you, Bog Monster! Do not mock Captain Candycone!  O yeah?! How would you like I should kick you in the nuts?!  I'll kick ''you'' in the nuts! You won't let me help.  The Bog Monster speaketh.  Uh huh. Why don't we just talk about the swastika? I mean, Germany was united under the swastika, right? But,… obviously history wasn't as important as changing the views after the war and stuff, so hey changed it. Yeah. Cool. Really? Mine too. What I really like to do, is I like to take the tops off of two cookies, and then put them together and make "quadruple stuffs." No way! Me neither.  Huh. Whoa.  Go ahead. Ahh!  Okay, It will be like this forever. Me, too!  Oh, huh. Yeah. Yeah, totally huh. Yeah. See you later, heh. Ho,  huhuh, he, haha. <poem><i></i></poem> Yes! Yes! I'm a star! ''I'm a star!'' I'm--   God has finally spoken to me, you guys. And he has told me how I can make $10 million. Boy band. Boy band. There's nothing faggy about $10 million, asshole! This was a message from God! That didn't stop any of the other boy bands, dumbass!  I've got prerecorded music we can sing to, just like they do. All we need to do is practice our choreography over and over and over! Shut up, Kenny. And then, I know I can get us a gig at the South Park Mall.  So everybody get in a straight line, we're gonna listen to a song from the top, and take it-- So? What?  Dammit! Okay, okay okayokayokay. We'll put off practice for now, and hold auditions for a fifth member. Get the word out that auditions will be tomorrow morning!  Eheh, thank you Butters. We'll let you know.  We'll let you know, Butters. Pffft! Oh my God, his intonation was so off! Guys, if we're gonna impress the mall owner and get that gig, we'd ''better'' do it better than that.  Next! Kyle's brother? Christ's sake..!  Next!  Next audition!  '''''Goddammit, NEXT!'''''   No way! Okayokay, fine. ''Wow'' me. Thanks, Wendy. Don't call us. We won't call you either, heheh.  Dude, she's a ''chick!'' "Nobody's gonna notice"?! What about her huge freakin' hooters, huh?!  Oh, this is a democratic boy band, is it? Alright, fine! She's in until she screws up! Okaaay! You guys all ready to rehearse? We have to rehearse all that we can!  My mom made us costumes! Yeah.  'Cause I'm like, you know, the tough one. Every boy band has to have the one member that, you know, is tough.  ...Kyle, you are the sweet one. Will you please just cooperate and not-- You can't ''be'' the tough one because you're Jewish! Since when?! Alright, fine! Here!  I heard it on HBO. It means, like, you know, when you...  pretend to use your finger like a gun or something.  Okay, Kenny, what does "fingerbang" mean, then? ...What?! Who the hell would do that?! Jesus Christ! Grow up Kenny, would you?! Alright, boys, let's do it from the top. 1, 2, 3, 4!  Alright, guys. Let's do it like we rehearsed! We need energy! We need to be up! We're goin' to see the mall manager.  Oh, God, I can't see!    Alright, guys, here we go.  Hello, sir! We... are Fingerbang! We would like to audition for you for a gig in the central plaza of your fine mall. Sort of like Tiffany, yes. Can we audition? Alright! Let's do it, boys!  <poem><i>--you're my fantasy, you fanta--</i></poem>  Well, so can we play here? No?? Why not?! You don't think we're any good, do you?! Well, come on guys. We gave it our best.   Problem, Chef. I have m-many problems. I just don't know what I'm gonna do.  Chef, God told me I was to start a boy band and make $10 million. The problem is, it isn't working. I mean,  What's the Gomlich effect? So how do boy bands use that? Thanks! Okay.   Alright, everybody, listen up! This is how this first shot is gonna work: The girls are standing here, and then the members of the band walk by looking cool. When you see us, you girls all scream like, "Oh my God, it's Fingerbang! Oh my God!" Okay? I'll pay you afterwards. Promise. Okay, Timmy, roll camera.  Huh? Oh, Chef says to put a cucumber down my pants for good luck.  Waitwaitwaitwait, ''cut!'' Let's go crazier than that! I mean, you have to act like it's freakin' Leonardo DiCaprio! Fine! Who would you go crazy for? ...Okay, fine! Pretend that we're Matt Lauer. Roll camera! '''''Jesus Christ!''''' Aaand cut!  Alright, our video's complete. Through the grace of God I can now go back to that mall manager and ''show him what we've got!'' Oh uh, Kyle has it.  Attention, shoppers: There are naked people at the orange smoothie machine. There are naked people at the orange smoothie machine.   Hello again! I know you didn't love our audition. But now we have a video.  Uh, god dammit..! Our camera guy kinda sucks, but this next shot we did was really cool.  Son of a bitch!  You don't understand. Girls were going crazy for it. Please. This is what God want me to do. Ple-ease. Really? You will? That's all we need! How about this afternoon at 3 o'clock? Yes! Thank you sir, you will not be disappointed!  Aw, Mom! Where the hell is Stan?! I swear to God, if he ruins this dream of mine I will '''''have his nuts!''''' Yes. Yes, sir, any second—we're just waiting on one more member. Yeah. We'll start right away.  We'll have to do it without him. Oh, god-dammit! God dammit! People are walking away!  Just another minute.  Well God, I guess you got me again, didn't you? Hyeah, that was a good one, God. Hope it made you laugh, you sick bastard. Oh, thank you God! Oh, praise his name!   Sir! We're all here now! Can we go on, please? We will!  And so, without further ado, all five members of the...  No! He can't be dead! No! We were so close! But we have to perform! Thank you all for your patience, and now get ready for Fingerbang! Chuh!  Yes! Yes! Thank you, yes! Ok-Okay, okay. Okay, yeah, maybe.  God..! Now it's like everybody wants a piece of us. I don't know if I can handle all this fame. I mean, I always thought I'd ''wanna'' become famous, but now that I am, I don't know if I like it. I mean, I probably can't even walk through this mall right now without people goin', "Oh my God, it's the Fingerbang guy! Oh my God!" Aw, screw God. I'm not scared o' him. He's a pussy.   "It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's separation  to increase the population of the younger generation." No no, no. Separation.  Ugh! Yeah. I'll see ya later, mom.  A- And as long as we get this Communion thing, we're safe? Yeah, what ''if'' we haven't? Jesus was made of crackers? So wwe won't go to hell as long as we eat crackers.   Nno! But now we can have Communion and not go to hell, right? Oh yeah, okay. Right, I already got that one. Dude, he's Jewish. He doesn't have to confess his sins. No, you're already going to hell. You are, too! Alright. That was mostly Kenny's fault. What'd we do to Timmy? Oh yeah, you're right. I guess Timmy's pretty screwed.  How was it? Huh? Who's in there? Well, here goes everything.   Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. Well, let's see. I'd like to start, if I may, back when I was two and a half. It was a cold April morning, and the dew on the grass was frozen, like tiny beads of glass... And that was about everything from first grade. Then last year, well, you can't tell anybody about this stuff, right? Okay, because, last year, I took a sandwich that the priest of this church had been eating. No, but I'm not finished yet. I took the sandwich that the priest was eating, took the piece of ham out of it, put it between my butt cheeks, and then put the sandwich back and watched him eat it.  Yeah, and then this other time, I went pee-pee in the holy water thing, and the priest blessed himself on the forehead with it every day for about a week.  Oh! Somebody help! God damnit! Let me out of here!  Oho! Ohoho. I felt it, you guys. I felt the angry hands of God.  He is an angry God, you guys. We all have to start taking this very seriously.  Halleluyah! Wash away the sin-eh! Turn around so I can clean out your ass. What? Oh, now you've said it, too! Aw, dude, we've gotta go back to church and confess again. Ugh. Oh, I know.  And he never took Communion! Yeah.  Come on, hurry up!   What? No! It shouldn't be locked! We have to confess! We have to confess our sins before we die! I'm first, I'm first!   You're doing unnatural things in the house of God! Oh, this guy is so gonna burn! Well, it looks like we're gonna have to save Timmy, Kyle, and everyone else in this town from the angry hand of God ourselves! We have-uh repeatedly broken God's commandments-uh! We have lived our lives for ourselves-uh! Totally ignoring the Lord-uh!  It is much better for thee to enter into life maimed- There is only one answer! As kids we must abandon this town of sin and start anew! It will be a long road, but at the end of that road is Salvation! And ''I'' am going to lead you there! Well, it looks like we're gonna have to save everyone in this town ourselves! I am saying this because we must be saved-uh. The Lord is powerful and he will smote the sinners and send them to everlasting hell-uh. If you do not live your life for Him-uh, then to the lake of fire you shall go-uh!  Many of you knew Kenny McCormick. He was a playful school-going eight-year-old. And then yesterday, he was  Who will help us? Praise God-uh! This is bea-utiful. Thine church is almost completed. Very well. Yea. Guys, let us walk to mine home and see what mine mom wants.  No! This is a trick! Do not vex me, O temptress! This is a distraction from our work on the church!  Not the pleasures of this Earth, but salvation in the world aftah!! Let us get back to our work at the church.  Hello?  Oh my God!! It's Kenny. He's calling from beyond the grave! Kenny! You have to tell us about hell! Give us every last horrible detail!  He said that in hell, the smell is awful. He said that in hell, everyone speaks Spanish. He said there is water in hell, but if you drink it you pee blood out your ass for seven hours-uh! And perhaps worst of all, in hell, there are dozens and dozens of little trinket stores! But they all have the same little trinkets in them-eh!  Your daughter could die tomorrow, and then what?! The Lord has spoken again-uh! O, forgive us, Lord, for our sins-uh! Let us pray.  Heavenly Father, do not send us to hell. We're sorry. Whatever we did, we're sorry. Let's see... Matthew 15:11. "Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which comes ''out'' of the mouth defileth a man." That's a good one, Clyde Frog. Interesting.  Yea. It is nice to see you, Sister, but I must prepare for my next sermon.  Sister, have you read this book? Then you know what it says happens to those who don't follow the Lord-uh. Are you saying that what the Bible says isn't true? We've got Jews and perverts and bullies and all kinds of sinners in this town, Sister Anne-uh! And without the priest we've decided to save ourselves. The only ones that kids can trust now are me and Jesus!  Well... Today this Jewish boy and all sinners are going to be saved-uh! Kyle, do you believe in God-uh? Do you want to be saved from hell-uh?! That's good, because right now, all the Jewness is comin' out of your body, bein' replaced by the Spirit of God-uh!  Theah! Praise God! How do you feel now? Do you feel the light of God inside o'ya? Praise the Lord-uh! ''For he is Lord, he is Lord...'' Bring up the next person!  This boy has been crippled with sin-uh. But I hear God saying that this boy will walk! We are gonna save you and you are gonna walk with the Lord-uh! Devil be  '''''gone'''''-uh! Now ''walk'', Timmih!   Come on, Timmy, get out of that chair-uh! The Lord wants you to walk, Timmih! Oo-'''''walk''''', Timmih!  He walks-uh! Yes! Praise the Lord! ''For he is Lord<br />Lord, Lord, Lord''<br />Where are you from, little boy?  And God is telling me that you have... bad eyesight. Is that it? Well, God is gonna heal those eyes, and save you from the devil begone!  ''For he is Lord<br />Lord, Lord, Lord''<br />Right here we have a little girl who is very, very ugly! Do you believe he is gonna cure your face of the uglies?! He is gonna take that ugly face and make you reasonable to look at!  Bah!  Bwolololololololololololo! Oh, good Lord, somebody say "Amen!" ''Hallelujah! Praise the Lord!'' And now, I'm receiving a message directly from God-uh! God is telling me that... each and every one of you is to walk up to the stage, and give me one dollar!   It worked, you guys, it actually worked! Eh-everybody bought the whole act! They keep giving and giving until we have it all! Of course, you guys! And then we can make... ten million dollars!  Look, the tooth fairy thing didn't work, the boy band thing didn't last, so I tried this route. It all came to me days ago, when we were first in Sunday school. Dude, if God is all-understanding, he wouldn't send us to hell. Even Sister Anne told me that. My brain is of a much larger size than you guys's. I couldn't expect you to understand, not until you actually saw the cash flow!  Suck my balls! Today is another day! And that's another dollar the Lord needs from you-uh! So come on up and give to the Lord-uh!  Sister Anne is a blasphemer!  Uh-oh.  Jesus, ix-nay on the ool-schay.  and, putting a dollar in the box-uh!  I can't be cheated out of my ten million dollars again! God damnit! You're gonna send me to hell?  '''''Aw, crap!''''' Yeah,  There, that's better. U-hoh, dude, we could walk all over her.   Why, that's PERfect!  Hey, what the hell is with these little half-desks?  Oh, weak, you guys. Seriously weak.  Oh, I'm sure I do. I'm trying.  Fantastic, then. You guys are all such pussies! Yeah. Only now do we realize how much we all took the third grade for granted.  I wish I was still there. Yeah, we just ''have'' to find somebody who knows ''how'' to do it. Yeah, if there's a way to travel back in time, those two dorks will know how! Look, whatever it takes, we just have to get back to third grade.  Oh, God-damnit, you guys, I am so seriously- We didn't ''do'' our homework, Ms. Makes-me-sick! We didn't ''feel'' like it! Hahaa! Charade you are, teacher! I'm afraid we have different plans! Gentlemen?  We're going back in time to third grade! Goodbye, teacher! Perhaps we shall see you in another year! Hahaaa!  You're damn right they do! Look, dude, can't you just build us another machine without him? Who the hell cares?! God, these guys are such geek dumbasses! Haha, Teacher, we're traveling back in time to third grade!-God-damnit you guys, you seriously said this time you'd snap into it with me. Yes! We've had a ''new'' time machine built: this one out of a simple microwave oven and a duck  There it is! Come on, everybody!  No way, lady! You can suck my balls! ...What? Touché, teacher. Touché. What?? Oh, but you have a Trapper Keepe-- Oh, you got the little Crapper Keeper, didn't you? Well, at least your stupid brother got a briefcase. He's not a genius; he's a little douchebag. Trapper Keeper, I need to drown out my annoying friend. Please initiate music, country, high volume.  Yeah, that's me. Yeahhh, you already know about it? Well...  "Nobody gives a crap about your Trapper Keeper, Cartman!"  And so the ''other'' thing that makes ''my'' Trapper Keeper cooler than Kyle's is that it can add any peripheral device to itself automatically.  and... Trapper Keeper? Hybrid with Wellington Bear calculator. And now it can use Wellington Bear calculator, too. Uh, n-no, I'm afraid not, Bill Cosby, because it is coded to the prints on my fingers.  If anybody but me tries to hold it, big metal spikes come out and pierce through their hands. Oh really?  Hold it.  Hold it. I don't know, dude. I'm not supposed to have any male friends that are over 30. I kind of screwed on that once. Dude, you can't just ''ask'' to be somebody's friend and be their friend; it doesn't work that way. If you want to be ''my'' friend, you'll have to pay me. Okay, that's cool. A-alright. Pretty sweet, you guys, getting a hundred bucks to play tetherball with some--  Ugh..!  Ey! You son of a bitch!  Turn left here! We're getting close! Get your gun ready!  There he is! Got ya!  Ahh, try to take my Trapper Keeper, will you?  Book him, Barbrady. Another job well done.  You guys. Did I mention that it has a pencil sharpener ''and'' a crayon sharpener? What would you guys have me do, huh?! Walk around with just a plain old Trapper Keeper like Kyle's?! Is that what you want?! Aw, damnit!   Hey, dudes. Yeah, I'm a genius! Last night I went home and told my mom that I ''lost'' the last one. Then I cried and I cried, and finally she felt so bad that she took me to the store and bought me a new one!  So everything worked out. Why the hell not?! Wait... so then you guys burned my ''last'' one for no reason!  But I don't think I can get my mom to buy me another one. Oh, that is bullcrap! And you know what I think? I think this whole thing is a setup! That's right! Kyle ''got'' this guy to ''say'' that he's a robot from the future just because he's jealous of ''my'' Trapper Keeper! And you know what else? Screw you guys. I'm going home.  Ech! Screw you guys. Home.  Sweet. You're so cool, Trapper Keeper. I would never let those assholes take you away.<br />''[singing his own ''Dawson's Creek'' theme song] I don't wanna wait for my Trapper Keeper to be over<br />The ways of my Trap--'' Oh, cool.  Whoa... Kyle is just jealous of you, Trapper Keeper. You kick ass!<br />''I don't wanna let my Trapper Keeper get--'' ''Screw you guys, screw you guys<br />Screw you guys, scr--'' Huh?  Oh, sweet. What's it gonna hybrid with now?  Ugh--! ''I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Kyle.'' ''Hey, screw you.'' ''Agh--! [four metallic arms from all directions reach out to trap him, then six more organic ones come in to secure him]'' Oh. Well, I guess everything's fine now. So let's go home. Awww, man... Alright, alright.  Kyle...  Stan, what the hell is wrong with you? I can't understand your lines! No! If we want our play to be better than the kindergartners' play, we have to rehearse as much as possible! Now let's continue the scene! God-damnit, Timmy! Helen Keller isn't supposed to talk! ''How'' good? Alright, alright! Quiet down! Look, we still got four days until the Thanksgiving festival; that's plenty of time to revamp our play! Yeah, but nobody told us ''how'' we had to do it. We can have Thanksgiving stuff and music numbers, too. That's the spirit, gang! Alright. Stan and Wendy, you go out and find some musical instruments! Kenny and Clyde, take some kids and buy some Thanksgiving decorations for the set! Kyle and Timmy, you go out and find a turkey! This is gonna be the best version of the Miracle Worker ''ever!'' Guys, I want you all to meet Jeffrey Maynard. He's South Park's biggest expert on musical theater, AND, he played the lead in ''Les Misérables'' at the Denver Community Playhouse for five weeks. Alright! Places, everybody! Bring in the turkey!  What the hell is that? And ''where''... pray... is our beautiful trick performing turkey?  Kyle? Why do you do these things to me? You say, "No, Timmy, you can't have that turkey! Bad Timmy!" Cool! Can you get it for us? No no!  I can't sleep, Mom! I have to write the lyrics for the opening song of our Helen Keller Thanksgiving spectacular!  Mo-o-om, I have to write these lyrics so the plight of Helen Keller can be realized by the common man.  Come on, you blind bitch! Channel your spirit through me!  OP-pression! Awesome! Do you have a turkey that can do tricks? Yeh. Whoa. Okay! Now we can really get this thing underway! Places, everybody!  Where the hell is Timmy? Uh, that's Gobbles, the physically challenged turkey.  No, Timmy! That handicapped turkey does not go in our play! No, that's right. Only Timmy knows the part. Oh, Jesus! Okay, fine! Helen Keller can have TWO pet turkeys!  Oh, God-damnit, now what are we gonna do?!  Dude, we need your turkey for our play! I know, I know, but listen: Uh, let me try to explain the position I'm in here. The retarded turkey belongs to our friend, Timmy. And Timmy's the only person who knows the part of Helen Keller. So, so tell me what I can do here to make everybody happy? I can't dude. Timmy has a boner for it. Unfortunate accident? You mean, like Geena Davis getting her own TV show?  Oh. Alright, alright! Just get your turkey to stop crapping all over the dressing room and come out for rehearsal! I'll take care of everything.  Okay, uh, hold it. Uh, let's hold it right there a second.  Aw, crap! I must've rigged the wrong light!  Alright, got to write the new lyrics. Lemme see.  Terrible!  I can't write the lyrics for the third act! Nothing's coming to me. Like what? Hey, that's not a bad idea. Oh, man! No, just the same old crap I always see when I close my eyes. Wait. I've got it! The perfect setup for when Helen Keller's pet turkey jumps through the hoop of fire!  Yes! Yes! I have it now!  Alright everybody, let's take our places! I don't know.  I don't know, you guys! Alright, maybe I tried to have Timmy's turkey crushed by a stage light, but I didn't do anything else. I'm not an asshole.  Hey, the fountains you guys installed are shorting out some of our lights. Union Mafia bastards!  Leave?? Leave?? But nobody else knows the part of Helen Keller! ...Alright, fine! Get in costume! What the hell is he doing? Helen Keller isn't supposed to sing!  What the hell did you assholes do?! This is supposed to be the big finale where the turkey jumps through the ring of fire!  They loved it! They LOVED it! That's it? I know what's gonna happen, Mom. You wanna know what's gonna happen? Whoa! That totally surprised me!  I can't believe how the show manages to stay fresh.  God, I have to do everything around here! ''I'mo drag home myself, babih. But the- [blinks and looks up. In the living room now with his mom are Stan's parents, Kyle's parents, Mr. Mackey, Mr. Garrison, and Dr. Doctor.]'' What the hell's going on?  What?! You're God-damn right I have a problem! ''Terrance and Phillip'' is on and I don't have anywhere to sit! Now what the hell is this?! Fat camp? Alright, I don't know who the hell put you all up to this,  but I am ''sure as hell not going to any gay-ass fat camp!''  Mom, tell them! Tell them I'm not fat, I'm just big-boned! Tell them all those stories about how ''everyone'' in your family was big as a child but then grew into their bodies! Well, I'm ''pissed off'', Rick! How are you?  No.  Would somebody put this retard out of his misery?!  This... is... bullcrap!  I'm starving. This is it. I'm going to die here.  Take it! I can't eat this crap!  Yeah, well, when I was in prison, we used to sneak stuff in by hiding it up our ass. Psss. Yeah, I'm not falling for that one again! Alright, Clyde Frog. We just gotta clear the counselor building and we're free.  Boy, am I glad to see you! You're ''damn right'' you can! Two Roller Pops, please! Hunh?   Memememeee!  Is anyone starting to suspect anything? Ahawesome! Alright, throw it over! What?! Alright alright! Keep your voice down! I'll bump you up to 10%.  Suck my balls, 20! Waitwaitwaitwait! Fine, 20! But just remember that ''your'' parents think that ''you're'' in the drug rehab center next door! You blow your cover and we're ''both'' screwed!    Why are you crying, Chad?  Hey, Chad, eh... You know what you need? You need a friend. Yes.  ...There you go.   Eh- shut up, you half-Chad! You know? You guys are right. I'm sick of being the fat kid, too. I've been making excuses all my life. But I know deep down that if I took responsibility and really tried hard, and we all tried together, well we really can lose the weight!  What?! Well, screw you, fatasses!  No, dickhole. Four tickets, 28th row, for the Raging Pussies! Dummy, you don't ask if you can go! I'm telling my parents I'm staying at Stan's house, Stan's telling his parents he's staying at Kenny's house, and Kenny's not telling his parents anything, 'cause they're alcoholics and they don't care! Well, I guess you're screwed, then.   Well, you... could make them... go away for a while. Well, I mean, you... could... call the police and have them take your parents away. Yeah, I saw it on TV. All you gotta do is call the police and say that your parents both molestered you. I don't know, but it works. When I wanted to get rid of my mom's last boyfriend, I just called the police, and said he was molestering me, and I haven't seen him for three months. You have to make it convincing, though, when you call the police. You have to be like,  "my parents molestered me." No, but you've gotta cry, like this:  you say it was a bad touch. Something about a swimsuit - I don't remember, but you definitely answer "bad touch." Yeah, And cry.  Oh, he's ready. Hey, yeah! We should all say our parents molestered us!  Notice anything?  Yeah, nothing. There's not an adult left in town.  They've all been arrested, and the ones that ''weren't'' arrested have moved away because they're ''scared'' of being arrested Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Cotner. Won't you come in, please?  Mr. and Mrs. Cotner, as the mayor of Smiley Town, I would like to ask you a few questions. Parents?  Ah, you mean the birth-givers. They're not around. Okay, see, I am the mayor of Smiley Town, and so I will ask the questions around hyah! Eheh, I'm afraid you'll find all the phones... quite out of service.   Ringy-ding? Aaahh!  Where is your husband? Seize her!   Outlander! We have your woman! She still lives, outlander! Outlander, her blood was fair! Butters, calm down, alright? I believe you have something of ours, outlander! Give it back, or the female gets it!  Heh, heheh. We're running out of time! Hand our book over, quick! The Provider awakes! Aw, damnit! Alright.  Yeah, we'll call the police and say you molestered us, too. Take him down.  Snow igloos kick ass.  Aw, Jesus Christ! I'm going back to bed.  Kyle, I have a full day of watching TV tomorrow. I don't have time to go on a poo hunt right now, okay? Heh-tchoo! Oh, sorry, you might get some germs while you're walking around in human feces! Family? My mom''s barely bought me any presents so far.'' Anything for more presents! Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas, you guys! Only three shopping days until-  Oh, Jesus, not this thing again. Yeah, this thing really falls apart in the second act. My mom could make a better Christmas special than this! Hey yeah! We can make a little animated Santa Claus and Jesus, and it can star us instead of these little round-headed guys!  Heheh. Look, he made Stan all fat. What?! I AM NOT THAT GODDAMNED FAT!  You know, first thing in the morning when it just won't come out? ...deh..OOOWW!!!  Heheheheh, Chanukah sucks.  Don't call me fat, buttfucker. Well, I'm sorry! I have a cold! Alright! You know what? I have been here TOO LONG! I'm sick of making this stupid cartoon, and we're never goin' to finish it anyways!  Screw you guys, I'm goin' home!  What are you talkin' about, "quit"? Huh! I don't remember that. I guess- we might as well- go home now.  Yeah, ham. Ey! Why the hell did you have me say that?! Yeah. Let's just go home and open our presents. Yeah! I'll be a Jew too. What is it, snookums? Oh my! She must think that you are a very special little muffin. Don't say "tits," Eric. Well, then, now you should take that money and open up a savings account that has compounded daily interest. But Eric, I think maybe the tooth fairy wants you to use that money to learn about saving. ''Tucky tucky time, it's the best time of the night.'' No, honey, Mommy's gotta save her throat. I have to work tonight. Good night.  What do you have there, Eric? Oh, my. The tooth fairy will have to give you a big surprise for losing two teeth in two days. Oh. Eh-hello, Dr. Roberts? It's Ms. Cartman. Well, it's my son. He's lost a lot of his baby teeth, and I was starting to get worried. About a hundred and twelve. Yes. Fifteen of them in one night. Perhaps he should switch toothpaste? O-oh, thank you. Freebie next week.   Yes, Eric Oh. Eric, poopie, sit down.  Mommy has something to tell you. It's just that- well, there is no tooth fairy, Eric. I've been putting all that money under your pillow, and because you got so many teeth fall out, I've actually run out of money and can't go to the grocery store for at least a month. I'm sorry, Eric. All children find out sooner or later. No, honey. It's just- Oh, Eric, it's just part of being a child. Eric! Eric, wait! Eric, don't you realize you could've seriously injured your little friend? Don't apologize to us, apologize to him! Oh my goodness.  Oo, poopiekins? Yes. Mr. Pharmacist, this Ritalin doesn't have any side effects, does it? Alright. Oh my. Oh, don't they look precious? Eric, sshhhh.   Ooh, sweetums, did you laugh too hard again? Well, some more of your little friends are here to play with you.   Isn't that funny, sweetie? ''You ''have'' been bad, so you're gonna have to drink from this glass. [points to it, then spreads her legs and pisses into it as he watches]''  Hello, kiddies. I made you all powdered doughnut pancake surprise. What? Oh. Well,  alrighty then. I... don't think it worked.  Eric, Sister Anne has come to visit you. Right, because it will hybrid with all those other processors and generate a whole new era of technological darkness. Well, I certainly won't buy him anymore, then... Bill.  In his room. But, why don't I show you the rest of the house first?  Come this way, Billy.   Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah! Boopsie-kins, It's late. You need to be in bed. Now, hon! Twenty more minutes, and that's it.  Eh yes, sweetie. Oohh, honey, why don't you make it yourself?  some company. Uh, sweetie, your friends wanted to have a "talk" with you. Your friends and I have all chipped in and we're going to send you up to a weight-management retreat. Oh, sweetie, those were all lies. You're just fat.  ...And it has basketball courts and tennis courts, and you can call Mommy any time you want.  Yes. I'm afraid he's a little moody. Oh.  Well, goodbye, sweetie. Thanks for coming, everybody. Oh, no. Quite the contrary. Eric showed up and surprised me last night. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to present to you... the new Eric Cartman.  Believe it. He lost 40 pounds at his fat camp.  I made some healthy tofu pudding to celebrate. Who wants some?  We've learned to overcome it, son. You'll see. What the hell's wrong with Cartman?! Two dollars! For one tooth? Dude, every time ''I'' lost a tooth I only got a quarter. I already lost all my baby teeth. Okay, the string is tied to Kenny's tooth. You ready over there? What does it look like we're doing, Butters? We need a tooth, so we're using Timmy's wheelchair to pull out one of Kenny's. Uh, Butters, could we have it? Yeah, we just have to get ''Butters''' tooth. I guess we'll have to sneak into his house after he goes to sleep tonight.  Jesus Christ, why did we pick the fat guy to lift up in there? Well? Oh my God! Yeah. We just gotta keep finding teeth and putting them under ''your pillow''.   Dude, where's the money? What are you talking about, Cartman?! We're only $167 away from gettin' a Sega! Tell us what?! Dude.  You guys! You guys! I figured it out! Yeah, but, it's okay! We can still get our Sega Dreamcast! Look, the tooth fairy is all made up, right? So all we have to do is go to a really rich kid's house, put our tooth under his pillow, wait for his parents to leave him a whole buttload of money, and then sneak back in and take it! The kid will never even know. We can take the bus to the city. There's ''super''-rich people down there!  Totally, dude. Cherry Creek is the richest part of Denver. I'll bet these kids get at least ten bucks a tooth from the  "Tooth Fairy."  There. You can tell this is the kid's window 'cause it's got Mega Man stickers on it. Cartman, once you're in the kid's room, leave the tooth under the pillow, then come back out. We'll wait for the parents to see it and leave money, then swing you back in the house to grab it. This is the smartest business venture ever.  Hey, what the hell are ''you'' guys doing?! ...Hey, you can't do that! Because that's what ''we're'' doing! ''You'' scram! We were here first! ''You'' woke him up!  Who's the Boss? Uuh, yeah. Damnit! And we thought we were so original! Well, uh-what do you mean? What's a "tooth trade?" Amazing. Oh. Uh-I don't know. How much do we get if we work for you? We're in! We all want double-desserts today! U-uh, Chef. Chef! CHEF! We're not dealing drugs! No! Dude, having this much money is great! Working for Loogie rules! We can't do that, dude. Loogie will kick our asses. Dude, just stop thinking about it.  Kyle?  Aw, shit. What? Really? So you're not gonna hurt us or nothin'? We win again!  Sleds are for guys. Look, girls don't even ''know'' how to sled. Do something else. You got it! No problem! Oh, boy! We'll show them! Dude, this is horrible. We gotta get Cartman out of court so we can go practice. Dude, if Kenny takes Cartman to Mexico, how are we ever gonna win the sledding race on Saturday?  Hello? Son of a bitch! Alright, guys. It looks like Cartman's not gonna be able to sled with us for another... 13 years, so in the meantime we need someone to race with us against the girls on Saturday. Come on, who's the second-fattest kid in South Park? Deal with it, dude! Cartman's gone, so now you're the fat kid. Dah, that's what they all say. Okay, ready? Go!   Nice going, fat boy! Okay, we've figured it out. To add more weight to the sled, we're gonna use these bricks , but we're gonna cover 'em with kid's clothes so that the girls think it's another kid! Come on, let's get it a try.  Yeah-   Ooh, my God, we killed Kenny. We Killed Kenny. We're bastards.  Nothing else is ''gonna'' work.  We have to face the fact that without Cartman we're gonna lose to a bunch o' girls. You know something, guys? I think we all took Cartman's ass for granted. That does it! We've got no other choice! We've got to bust Cartman out of jail! I saw a movie once where they baked a cake and put a nail file inside of it. Cartman, why the hell did you have to commit a hate crime?! We're gonna lose to girls because of you! Yeah, you stupid umbassday! ...Yeah. Sshh!  How are we supposed to give them to you? But they're gonna search you on your way back to your cell. Alright, here.  Wow. I really wish I hadn't sat here and watched that. That sucks that we couldn't give him the nail file.  There's only one thing we can do. We have to go see Token and see if he'll forgive Cartman for hate-criming him. Come on, we're running out of time! Yeah. You know, they bus in people from different races to our school to promote cultural diversity. Yeah.  Hi. Can Token come out and play?  Token, you don't wanna see us guys lose to girls tomorrow, do you? It's not? Well, why don't you tell the governor yourself?  Okay, go ahead and start. Oh, uhyeah.  Yes, over the past few years our great country has been developing new hate crime laws.  If a person vandalizes a government building, is it not because of his hate for the government?  Mayor, it is time to stop splitting people into groups. All hate crimes do is support the idea that blacks are different from whites, that homosexuals need to be treated differently from non-homos, that we aren't the same. That is our presentation. An idea that we call... Just wait. We got Cartman pardoned; he'll be here any second. Alright, where's Clyde. Get on the sled, you fat piece of shit! It's Cartman! All right! Let's do this! Come on! We've gotta catch up to them!  We're not gonna make it!  We did it! Yeah,. We're never gonna take you ass for granted ever again. Dude, did you do all your homework last night? I know! Uh, Mr. Garrison, haven't you figured it out? Timmys' retarded. But he ''is''- He doesn't have to do homework? I've got ADD. Dude, it's Timmy. Yeah, Timmy ruhules! But he's funny. Yeah, what a dick. Timmy's five times more talented than he is. Huh? No, we're not actually gonna take that stuff. Because we're on Ritalin. Oh boy oh boy. But there are no side effects, Chef. See what? Let's watch something else. Oh dear. Timmy's band broke up? Yeah. Phil Collins was right. People laughed at Timmy, and Timmy should be at home, where he's protected from laughter. Sounds good. Oh my goodness, you killed Kenny. Chef, are you going to the Phil Collins concert tomorrow? Sure was, Dad. Oh, thank you, Chef. How nice.  I feel... different. Wait a minute! Phil Collins sucks ass! Get off the stage, Phil Collins! We want Timmy! No!  You see, we learned something today. Yeah, sure, we laughed at Timmy, but what's wrong with laughter? Just because we laugh at something doesn't mean we don't care about it. Timmy made us smile, and playing made Timmy smile, so where was the harm in that? The people that are wrong are the ones that think people like Timmy should be "protected" and kept out of the public's eye. The cool thing about Timmy being in a band was that he was in your face, and you ''had'' to deal with him, whether you laughed or cried, or felt nothing. That's why Timmy rules! Why do we have to dress up? Isn't this just a circus, with elephants and lions and stupid clowns Where?  Go away, please. Two hours. Damn, dude.  Damn, dude, do you see how much money this place is raking in? Yeah. This one's moving out of town, so we could take over.  Dude, this isn't working. Well, it's not good enough, Kenny! You have to get better! Try it again!  I'm tired, Grandpa. I don't know.  Hurry up, you guys! Dude, you're not gonna believe this. Yeah. They're quintuplets from Romania. Will you guys be in ''our'' Cirque du Celville? Well, not yet. Kenny has to get better at singing first. Okay, hold it, hold it.  What?!  Mom! Dad! Can the quints stay with us? Please? Can they? They have nowhere else to go.  Please? That's your dad?  Mom, Dad, you're not gonna send them back, are you?? No! We've just gotta convince these chicks that America kicks the ass out of every other country. Come on!  Okay, let's try it again. Hup! No, they can't! We've convinced them that they want to stay in America. ''Now'' what do we do?  Dammit, now I'm ''never'' gonna have my own circus! The government came and got the quintuplets. No more Cirque du Cheville for us. Yeah! Well, not this time! We've just gotta get that angry mob back on our side!  Alright, everybody, listen up! Those bastards broke in here and took those poor quintuplets to the mayor's office downtown! But they haven't won yet! I say we all go over to the mayor's office, and demand to see the quintuplets right now! Uh, sure, you can all get overtime. Hey! We wanna see the quintuplets!  Yeah. Oh, well. Doing our own circus was a dumb idea anyways. Whatever happened to Kenny? Dude, I don't understand this game at all. Um, deny it? Sweet. Dude, that's not cool. Don't give Kyle AIDS. You don't pay tax dollars, Cartman! You're eight! Oh, man, that's terrible. Haha, he-yeah ha.  Haaaaah.  Blaaa-lalalalalalala.  We're making faces at sick people. We don't know. You're ''not'' more mature than us, Cartman! Yeah. Now what are you going to do?  We don't wanna go to some stupid adult meeting anyway! Dude, maybe we do need to start being more mature. We got invited too, fatass! This is boring.  That seems kind of... weird. Yeah. Dude! I think these guys mean to have sexual encounters with us! Aah! There's more of them! Quick, hide!  Well, Cartman, you got everybody into this, you have to figure out a way to get everybody ''out''. Yeah. You know, we believe in equality for everybody, and tolerance, and all that gay stuff, but dude, fuck you. And now, do you still think that you need to hang out with older, mature friends?  Dude, what the hell was that?  ...Dude, you weren't drinking any milk. You have to be drinking milk for that to happen.  He's fakin'! Now, that's a get-well card!  Dude, you can stop faking now. We got a substitute teacher.  Kyle? Go on, Butters! Butters, go on! Dude, you really are sick, huh? Uh excuse me, but, what do these toxins look like? Wuh, have you ever actually seen a toxin? What? Those aren't toxins. That's the bean with bacon soup he ate half an hour ago. Don't be a smartass? Hi, doctor.  Well, it's my friend, Kyle. I think he's really, really sick. But I don't think it's working.  Die? But... Kyle's my best friend. In the whole world. ...I'll give Kyle my kidney, even if it hurts a whole lot; I don't care. Who?  Oh, shit. Cartman, we have to ask you a question. A very serious question. Kyle's in trouble, Cartman. I can see him getting worse right before my eyes. There might be a way that you... can save his life. What Kyle really needs... is a new kidney. His mom is trying all this Eastern medicine and New Age bullcrap on him, but it's obviously not working. Alright. Will you donate one of your kidneys to Kyle? But you only need one, fat boy! Dude, one of your friends is goin' tuh die! Don't you see how serious this is?! Oh my God! Cartman, you are so going to hell when you die! What the hell would you do with ten million dollars, fatass?! Come on, Kyle. Let's get out of here.  You mean the stuff that tastes like ass and doesn't fight cavities? Look, um... I know that you all think the earth and its natural healing powers can cure Kyle, but... the doctor at the hospital told me it can't. Isn't it possible that these Indians don't know what they're talking about? And that has something to do with their medicines because...? Nobody wants to listen, Kenny. I don't know what else to do. I mean, he could die, Kenny. And that means we'd never see him again. I guess maybe I've always taken friends for granted, like they'd always be there. If a friend died, I don't know what I'd do.   This is it?? This is everyone that wanted to help Kyle??  Jesus Christ! Alright, Butters, you take this medical book, and everyone follow me! We're gon' tuh take Cartman's kidney.   Okay. Me and Butters are gonna go up and take Cartman's kidney out of him. Kenny, you stay here and guard his mom's door here with Timmy. Sshhh! If she hears him screaming, or comes out or anything, just... stall her. Alright? Alright Butters, let's go.  Oh, no! Oh, phew. Okay, here we go.  Okay, let's see. Looks like if we cut here, and here... ...vein right, well-  No way! Kidney Blocker 2000?! You suck, Cartman! God-dammit, don't you care that Kyle is gonna die?!  There's nothing more I can do, Kenny. I've tried everything to save Kyle. Holistic medicine is gonna kill my friend!  Awgh! I'll never see Kyle again!  So NOW can we take Kyle to the hospital? That's alright. If you'll all help, I think I have a plan. Dude, please. Kyle needs it. Alright, alright, here.  You look a lot better. Dude, you're my best friend. I don't want you to die until I do. Kyle's all better, Cartman, thanks to you! It was all a trick. Your mom undid the kidney blocker, and then we put ketchup on your bed so you'd think we took your kidney. Hey, Mr. Garrison. Where have you been? Careful, Cartman, you might pop your stitches.  You don't even know what you're debating about half the time! Uh... that, that's okay, dude, I think we got it. Whoa, dude, I don't see anything wrong with that flag. Islam?? Well, we need help with our debate club. We have to explain why we think the flag should not be changed. Yeah, we don't see what the big deal is. But Chef, we don't know what you're talking about, it's-- Come on, you guys. We all have to work on this! I don't think we stand a chance in this debate, 'cause Wendy's leading the other side. Yeah, you ''must'' be thirsty after eating 60 mints.  Do ''you'' think they should change the flag? That was a good one.  Wait, I don't get it. Boy band? Dude, we don't have any musical talent. He's right. Well, I guess. Well, Cartman wants to start a boy band, so we're gonna rehearse and then try to perform at the South Park Mall.  Well but, Dad, all my friends are doing it.  Cartman says we can make $10 million. Dude, I don't think I could sing any better than that.  Uhhh, next is Ike Broflovski. Aw, come on, dude. Let her try. Come on, nobody's gonna notice. She's the best chance we have! I say she's in. Cartman, it's six in the morning. Do we have to rehearse this early? Costumes?  Hey, Cartman, how come your costume has like, nose rings and facial hair? Hey, Cartman, what does "fingerbang" mean, anyways? Kenny says that's not what it means.  Uh oh, mall cops. Well, I guess we can't get in to see the mall manager. Yeah. Uh-oh. We are making a music video. Dad, I was just a-- Dad, I did all my chores. Why can't I play with my friends? Dad, I ''like'' being in a boy band. I think it's interesting. ''No.'' Dad! It's not fair, Dad! Why can't I be in a boy band? Dad, Cartman said we're gonna perform at the mall at 3 o'clock. My friends are gonna be pissed off at me. I don't understand! Just let me go do this one thing, and I won't ever-- Dad? What the hell is going on? Jesus Christ. ...I never knew.  ...Oh-kay.  Dad? Well... I just wanted to tell you... that I don't think you're a joke. I mean, whatever you used to be, you're just my dad. And you're the best dad I've ever had. Yeah. Not really. Not any more stupid than some of the other stuff you've done. Really? Alright!  Oh my God, they killed Kenny! Oh, yes we do. You were great, Dad. Yeah. I just wanna be a normal kid again. Have a normal life and appreciate what I have. I don't think they sell those anymore.   Bo-ring.  Waiwaiwaiwaiwait. "It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's..." "It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's-" Mom, wuh we're staying for Sunday school. We have to go to Sunday school so we don't burn!   Are we gonna go to hell? What if we haven't really done anything that horribly bad in our lives. But crackers are his- body. Nonono, I get it. Jesus wanted us to eat him, but he didn't want us to be cannibals, so he turned himself into crackers, and then told people to eat him. No?? Confession?  Okay, let's see. Uuh, oh yeah, there was the time we threw a fish into the busdriver's hair and she didn't find it for seven days. And thennn there was the time we held that little first-grader down and farted on him for 28 minutes. We're trying to remember all our sins. Sister Anne told us we have to confess all our sins or else we're gonna go to hell. Have you confessed all ''your'' sins yet? Dude, this lady told us if you don't confess all your sins and you don't eat crackers and drink wine, then you go to hell. Period. Now, let's see. What about the time we set Mr. Garrison's cat on fire? What, Butters? Oh man, we can't let Timmy go to hell. We have to do something. I don't know. I don't know ''what'' we're gonna do. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art though amongst wo- Uh- Aw, dude, you screwed me up! The guy in there said I have to say 54 Hail Marys. Now I can't remember if I was on number seven or eight. I don't know. You can't see him; it's just some anonymous guy. ...Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Ble- God damnit!  Sister Anne? We have a question. Where do handicapped people go when they die? But our friend Timmy can't really talk. All he can do is say his own name, so he can't really confess his sins. So is he goin' to go to hell? What happened?? I don't think so. Alrightalrightalright. You heard the priest: the first thing we have to do is get you guys all baptized. Come on.  Okay, you'd better baptize Kyle some more. Cartman! Dude, you just said "ass"! That's a sin! Oh, shit!  Oh! But what about them? Okay, come on.  Come on! This stupid light won't change. We're goin' to church. We've sinned and so we have to confess again. Uh, come on, let's go.   ...Oh my God, they've killed Kenny! He's doomed.  Oh no! It's locked!  You're a sinner! Dude, if this guy's goin' to hell, who's gonna save us?  Let's go.   ...they've killed Kenny! Dude, if this guy's goin' to hell, who's gonna save us?  Don't you guys, um... persecrute our religious beliefs. What purpose does school have? The Bible says the only goal in this life is to praise God and get into heaven. There's no way God will want to send us to hell now. Wow, cool. Yeah! What? Kenny?!  What's he say? Dude, that seems kind of... weird. What worked? Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait. You mean that this whole thing has just been a way for you to make ten million dollars?  Well, what about going to hell and all that?! Dude, I am so disillusioned right now. Yeah! Well, here we are, dude, the first day of fourth grade. Dude, we gotta find some third-graders to beat up.  What grade are you going into? Stupid third grader! Denver?  Alright.   Like... ah, how about right at 8:35 we all jump up on our desks and pull down our pants and shout, "KISS MY ASS!!!" all together! ...I think showing her our asses should be quite sufficient, Butters. Okay, so it's decided. When the clock hits 8:35 we all stand up on our desks, pull down our pants and yell, "KISS MY ASS!!!" We got you covered, Timmy. Dude, look at the walls.  Everything is written in some strange, foreign language.  What a bitch! This is it. The end of innocence.  This is the loss of that playful youth all our parents warned us about. Hey, that's it! We gotta go back to third grade!  We travel back in time. It can't be ''that'' bad. People do it on TV all the time. We don't ''want'' to make it back, we want to ''stay'' there. Back in the third grade. Oh! Here she comes. Yeah! Timmy, you have to stop! No?? So if Timmy drops his speed below five miles an hour the chair blow, and if he gets off, the chair blows? My God! Over here, over here! Less than 20 minutes?! Well, who didn't see ''that'' coming? ...nine, eight... Dude! You gotta build us another time machine! W-what did you get in a fight about? Oh, Jesus Christ! You've got to be kidding me! Alright, come on, guys.  Man, I can't believe we have to do this while Timmy's already back in time! God-damnit, this is ridiculous. Dude, can you ''please'' just stop fighting with your friend and build another machine so we can travel back in time to the third grade? I know. Wait a minute! I've ''got'' it.  Dude, if you guys build another time machine, you can travel back in time and ask the creator of Star Trek how many episodes there ''were!'' Oh, son of a bitch!  Thah... That's what Mr. Garrison would've said. Dude. Sh-she's right. Yeah. Third grade sucked! Cartman, why the hell did you try to make us think third grad was so great?! Dude, it looks like he's been all over time! He must have such cool stuff to tell us. Dude, what's your little brother doing here? But isn't he only three years old? Cool! Wow, cool! Ms. Crabtree, there's another creepy homeless guy on the bus. But they smell like pee. Aren't you a little old to be in grade school? Dude, do you really care if Cartman has something that's better than yours? Oh, no, dude, here comes that weird new kid. Dude! He's running off with your Trapper Keeper!   What the hell just happened? Why are you so obsessed with Cartman's Trapper Keeper, Bill Cosby? Wow, that's amazing. What do you think, Officer Barbrady? Cartman, it takes over the world and destroy all of humanity! Yes! So what are you going to do with your crappy robot life now, Bill Cosby? Cartman! You still got a Trapper Keeper! Because if your Trapper Keeper takes over the world, then maybe it was this Trapper Keeper and not the one before! Cartman! Yeah, that's fine.  No, wait! Can I do it?  Sweet! Kiss your ass goodbye, fat boy! Well, yeah, or we could just kill him. He's right there. Uh-oh. Well, come on. Let's go upstairs and get Cartman's Trapper Keeper ourselves.    ''You'' break it down! Not it! You lose, Kenny.  Oh my God, they've killed Kenny! Then we have to stop it before it gets there!  Cartman, you have to stop! He ''is'' in there. One-two-three, not it! Kyle's got to succeed. He's just got to. No, I think that other thing is Rosie O'Donnell.  This is your chance, Kyle! Cartman has weakened! He did it! You did it, Kyle!  Kyle saved your life, fat ass! Huh, that's a bitch. Hey! Whoa whoa whoa, Cartman! All you've been doing is making fun of Kyle and now he's saved your life! You at least owe him a thank you! Cartman! 'Ere 'ere, my good wife, 'ere is nothing we can do.  E-yes. Perhaps she should go to an asyluh. 'Cause the 'eard 'urts my 'ace. Uh-eally? Uh you think so? Oh yeah, we can't! You do? Oh my God, they've killed Kenny! No, it's on the 'en or the 'ay.  Where's Gobbles, Timmy? <poem><i>No, that cannot be. Honey you are scaring me.</i></poem> Helen! Oh no!  Okay, here we go.  We worked our asses off to compete with that?!  I can't do it, dude. Too bad Cartman's missing this. He must be really sick.  That's so gross. I'll throw in five.  Eww-ho-hoo! He did it! Kenny's not feeling so good. That manatee spleen made him sick.  Well, at least you got it out of your system. Oh, you guys! You know, dude, there might be something ''to'' this. We knew he wouldn't make it. I don't believe it. Did you like the old one? We thought of it, Jesus. I mean, Kenny's the one that does it all, but we were the masterminds of the whole thing.  What's a prostitute? Chef, what's a prostitute? Hi Chef. Nice day, isn't it? Chef, what's a prostitute? Chef was just about to tell us what a prostitute is. Because Jesus told us that Kenny's a prostitute. Is he? Like what? No. Wow! This is Kenny's best show ever! Yeah, you've gotten lame since you got skinny. What's up?  You guys! It's Kenny! He's been arrested for prostitution in New York! For giving Howard Stern a hummer! I don't know! All I know is Kenny is in jail for at least three months! I ''know''!   Deal, druggie!  Oh my God, they've killed Kenny! ...Sort of.  You're not gonna believe what Cartman has! We're going tomorrow night! Cartman's got the bus schedule all figured out!  Well, of ''course'' your parents said you can't go! Parents can be pretty cruel sometimes, dude. They get off on it. The police? But what do the police do to them? Dude! Having no parents is awesome! I'm gonna say my parents molestered me, too. What's going on?  ...Then it's ours. The whole town. It's ours. You guys, stop it!  Sorry about them. Kindergartners are kind of spazzes. How come ''you'' wanna help the fatass?! You got foolied, outlander! We're the only ones with a working phone. And if you had taken our book, then it's one of ''us'' who dies tonight at Carousel! You mean in the before time? In the long, long ago? If we tell you, will you help us stop Fatass? Alright. Everybody gather round. We're gonna tell the story of the before time again.   Soon we were without power, water, or fresh food. But we tried to survive. Under the guidance of... the Provider.  The fatass and us disagreed on how to worship the provider. The fatass tried to make us follow ''his'' way by making himself the school principal. So we made ourselves the superintendents of school. But then he just made himself the mayor. The town split sides and that's when the Provider got angry.  So now, every night, the Provider must be appeased at Carousel. We need their book so one of ours doesn't die.  We all know that one day, the Provider will set us free. Make everything like it was in the before time. In the long, long ago. Yes. No foolies.  Awesu-home! No. If they have it, one of ''ours'' will die for Carousel! It's time for Carousel! Haha, your side doesn't have its book, fatass! That means someone on your side is sacrificed tonight.  Parents? He's right, dude. Things were a lot better with our parents around. Come on, you guys! Our parents are gonna be back any minute! Well, they can't be ''too'' pissed off. I mean, we made them a banner. Hey, you guys came back! Huh. I dunno.  You guys wanna build a snow igloo?  A-ah huh. Ho-o-oh. What is this all about, Kyle? I know, it's like it doesn't matter anymore. Nobody's paying any attention.   This is hopeless. We're just gonna have to face that the commercialism has been sucked out of Christmas. Dude, change the channel. This is too depressing.  How come everyone in cartoons has such big heads?  And why is it that on Charlie Brown cartoons, everyone talks like this. What, dude? We don't know anything about animation. Yeah! And we can call it... "The Spirit of Christmas"  It'll have everything. Jesus, Santa. And when people see it, they'll just HAVE to get in the spirit. All we need is three hundred dollars for our budget.  Yeahyeahyeah. just let us see 'em!  That's not me, that's you!  Okay, here's the script. But it doesn't have an ending. Hey! Wait a minute! Aren't you Jewish, Kyle?  You guys, knock it off! We have to record this!  What's awesome? That's not ''in'' the script They do this all the time. Easy. Uhd- W, ''WW-e'' wish you a Merry Christmas Okay.  One. Kickass! Uuhh, E. W-EE wish you a Merry Christmas.   E mouths...  2. "We wish you a m- Merry" AAAAAAAA! That took us half an hour to set up, fatass! We can't do it without him, Kyle. We've already animated him in it! Kyle, it's hopeless. We've only got 20 seconds of animation done, and we still have Jesus' and Santa's voices to record, and we don't even have a third act. Dude, it would take a ''miracle'' to finish this thing! <poem><i>We love</i></poem> <poem><i>Tralala</i></poem> <poem><i>We sit.</i></poem> <poem><i>Tralalalala</i></poem> "Awgh! I'm so fat!"  "Hey, you guys! Seriouslih! I'm so fat! Help me out over hmyah!" '''Cartman:''' Ey! I don't need to take that kind of shit from a Jew!  <poem><i>We wish</i></poem> <poem><i>Tralalalala</i></poem> <poem><i>We sit.</i></poem> <poem><i>Tralalalala</i></poem> ...It's okay. We'll just have his character die in the film.  Hey! Wait a minute! Aren't you Jewish, Kyle? ''(voice rising)'' Dude, Jewish people don't celebrate Christmas! You're supposed to sing Chanukah songs! For nothing. Yeah. And you know? I think I've learned something today, it doesn't matter if you're Christian or Jewish or Atheist or Hindu. Christmas still is about one very important thing.  No not ham! ...Christmas is about something much more important!  Presents. Don't you see, Kyle? Presents. Are you kidding? I think we'd rather stab ourselves in the head. Wow! Count me in! He's fat and he's stupid? No way! ''I'' only got a jar of gefilte fish. ...Totally ''what?'' Me too.  You still have baby teeth, Kenny?  Almost. You ready, Timmy? When I say "go," you slam your electric wheelchair into high gear. Okay, Timmy? Right. You're Timmy. Alright! Get ready, Timmy.  Dude, maybe we ''don't'' have to rip a tooth out of Kenny's mouth. Yeah, let's go.  No, Timmy, wait! Come on, fatass! Did the tooth fairy come? Four dollars? No more money?? Cartman, what's going on?! What do you mean, "there's no tooth fairy?" That can't be. ''My'' parents wouldn't lie to me.  You're wrong. If my dad says something is real, then it's real! It's not true!  Dad, there is so a tooth fairy, huh?  Oh my God! You ''did'' lie to me.  Peter Pan, too?? What about Moses and Abraham? ''Pro''bably?! Is Atlantis real??  Wahahahah! Fun for children?! Fun for children?! Look at me, Dad! I don't even know what's real anymore! Weaaaah!  What about Dan Rather? Do you think he's real? All made up. Not real. Nothing's real. Oh my God, what if ''I'm'' not real? I mean, what if I'm just part of my ''parents''' reality? What if this is all just somebody's dream? Two years? Cartman! See ya.  Dude, ''this'' book says there could be infinite alternate realities to every reality. Oh my God, ''this'' book says that negative and positive are the same thing; that real and not real are one.  Dude, ''this'' book says I don't exist unless I think I do. But what if I don't? I can't deal with it, Stan. I mean, all the stuff I've been reading; I really don't think I exist! But I can't, because, what if thinking about it is the only thing keeping my space-time together?  Sometimes I think I can see time slowing down,  and my own existence fading. Light is a wave unless it's observed? That means ''all'' matter is just a wave.  I am nothing, and everything. Hunh. That was pretty weird. Yeah. But you know, I've learned something today. You see, the basis of all reasoning is the mind's awareness of itself. What we think, the external objects we perceive, are all like actors that come on and off stage. But our consciousness, the stage itself, is always present to us. Oh yeah?! Phil Collins Hill on Saturday! You got it! Fatass. What the hell are they doing? Don't worry, dude. That little truck just runs on D batteries. It's gonna run out of juice soon.  Yeah. Cartman's weight was what gave us speed, so we need to find the next-fattest kid besides Cartman.  Yeah. Okay, get over here, Clyde. Yeah, fatass! Get your fat butt on the sled!  Awwgh! Hey dude, we don't even have enough weight to move. Yeah, why don't you go eat some more pork rinds or something, you fat fuck?!  We killed Kenny? Well, that didn't work. What else can we try? If only we had realized how special our time with his gigantic ass was. How? Sweet! Let's go!  Hey, fatass. How's prison? Yeah! So you gotta bust out of here.  There's a ailnay ilefay inside of it.  An ailnay ilefay. Listen, aggotfay! An ailnay ilefay so you can eakbray out of isonpray! They on'tday?!  Why the ellhay otnay?! It ooktay ourfay ourshay to akebay this Od-damnedgay akecay, and ownay we're otallytay ewedscray! Well, we got some cigarettes, but we don't think you should be smoking. Each year, over a million people die of smo- Me too. Don't fart on your way out; you might make little smoke signals.  So ''now'' what do we do? Dude, I didn't know Tolkien lived so far away. Yeah. But isn't Tolkien the only one? Killer. Well then,  you've got to call the jail right now and tell them that you forgive Cartman for being a dumbass! Dammit! Son of a bitch, dammit!  Oh, sorry. Huh? Why not? I don't start, you start. And we think that that is  a savage hypocrisy, because all crimes are hate crimes. If a man beats another man because that man was sleeping with his wife, is that not a hate crime?  will have a chance to win the sledding race on Thursday. He's gotta show up. He's just ''got'' to. Dude, I guess we've just got to try it without him. On the sled, fatass! Go, fatass! Oh no! The girls are gonna win! We won! We won! It's good to have you back, Cartman. Yeah. But there was so much of it. I was up until two in the morning. The Declaration of Independence? Hey wait. I think maybe ''I'' have Attention Diffunction Disorder. ...I ''am'' eight. No way!  He looks pretty happy to me. Dude, did you see that stuff Phil Collins was saying about Timmy? We all have Attention Deficit Disorder. So we all started taking Ritalin. That's correct, Chef. Yes, but now we don't have any homework, so we can go see Timmy play downtown at Mile High Stadium No, not at all.  Gee, you seem a little stressed, Mr. Garrison. Why don't you try some Ritalin?  Yes, let's.  You know something? I think that's good. It was wrong to make Timmy a singer. Yeah. I think Phil Collins rocks the house. Bastard. Phil Collins is playing Lalapalala's, and because we're all doing so well in school now, our parents said they would take us. Yes. His flowing melodies are really enjoyable to us. Come, see him with us. Yeah.  Yeah! What the hell were we thinking?! Boooooo! Yeah! Yeah! Tim-my! Tim-my! Awwww! How long does this thing last? Whoa.  Those contorting Romanian chicks rule. Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?! They're identical! Hey, we should start our ''own'' Cirque du Cheville. Let's go practice.  It's Kenny's singing! What?!  What's a "quin-tuplet"? But there's only four of you. So if you're identical, does that mean you all ''think'' alike? How can you say that? Oh, ''yeah!'' Hoh no, dude. If they get sent back to Romania, we'll ''never'' get our Cirque dei Ceville going.  You don't wanna go back to stinky Romania, do you? It sucks there. Alright! Yeah, we've shown them amusement parks and malls. How can you expect them to go back now?? Damnit! How come every time we get a sweet idea, the government has to screw it up?! Kenny was never gonna get his singing right anyway. Alright, Cartman. I'm gonna give you... a jail-time card.  You lose a turn. What? AIDS?!  What? You don't know what you're talking about, fatass! See? I ''told'' you, dude. Those are dialysis machines.  Old people have to hook themselves into it with a tube, and it sucks all their body fluids out. I know, hunh? Put your mouth against the glass like this.   Bleuh-leuh-leuh-leuh-leuh. We don't know what you're talking about, lardbutt. Wow. Your mom's pregnant, Kenny. What are you talking about, fatass? They are? We don't ''wanna'' go! We don't WANNA go! Yeah. I guess we gotta try to get into that club, too. Yeah.  HEY, WHEN ARE WE GONNA GET TO SOME ACTION, HUH? Dude. Being mature is ''boring''! I know, dude! Let's get the hell out of here!   Dude! We're surrounded by perverts. How? Dude. You have sex with children.  Dude. You have sex with children. Seriously. Well, Cartman? Don't you think you owe everyone an apology for bringing NAMBLA here? I don't know, I... How much? Better, thanks. Hey, thanks for going through all that to save my life, Stan. Oh. ...Thanks?  What the? Cartman doesn't always win! He just gets pissed off and goes home so we can't debate anymore! Told ya. Yeah, we got it. Yeah, me neither. Not really. Okay. since my dad's a lawyer, he says we can use any of his books we want.  Kenny, how many of my dad's mints are you gonna eat? Jesus! I know your family's poor, but you can't just eat an entire bowl of mints for dinner. Dude, you're just saying that because she's your girlfriend. Yeah, you can have a drink of water. The dispenser's over there.  Pretty good, I guess. Kenny ate all the mints, dad. Oh. Our main point is that the flag shouldn't offend anyone, because killing has been around since the beginning of time. All animals kill.  Huh? W-we really didn't ''see'' it that way. Y-yeah, but… the color of someone's skin doesn't matter. Yeah.  Oh. Sweet, dude. I don't think we have to do this stupid debate now.  Stan? No, see? There's people of all colors. And they added a black guy as one of the hangers, too, so it's not racist. ...How? I'm not being in any  faggy boy band! Wait a minute. There's only four of us. So, all boy bands have five members. 'N Sync, Backstreet Boys, New Kids on the Block. All had five members. It was? I promised my mom I'd let him try.  Come on, Cartman! You haven't liked anybody else! Dude, what are you talkin' about? That was awesome! Me too.  I wanna be the tough one.  I wanna be the tough one! Jews are tough! Since Abraham, fatass! Jesus Christ! Wow. I feel so rejected. Run for it!  Dude, what's wrong with your leg? Wow. There must be at least 20 people out there.  He'll be here. Stan wouldn't douche. Hell no! I'm not being part of a four-member boy band! We'll look stupid! It's Stan!  Dude, where the hell have you been?! You bastards! Dude, he's pretty dead. We don't have a fifth member, Cartman! We made two dollars. Yeah. ...Yeah. That's gonna suck. Hey, Cartman, do you think God's getting mad at you for not making $10 million?   Hey, dudes. What are you doin'? Uhwuwhat? No-o-o-o-o! Oh good. I don't? I am not! I'm gonna go ask my mom!   Mom! Dad! Am I gong to hell? Nothing. But the guys said if I don't confess my sins and eat crackers, I'm gonna go to hell. We don't? But what if we're wrong? Yeah, but if they're wrong, no big deal. If ''we're'' wrong, we burn in hell. Well, you guys can do what you want! ''I'm'' going down to ''that'' church to confess my sins and eat crackers! And I'm taking Ike with me!   We have to ask you something. Yeah. If we're Jewish, are we gonna go to hell?  Stan! You've got to help us become good Christians. ''Please.'' HAAAAH! But what if we're wrong? Yeah, this life is short. The afterlife is forever. Yeah, this church kicks a-- Eh... I-it kicks! Don't try to take me away again, Mom and Dad! I ''told'' you! I renounced the Jewish faith!  Ask him what hell is like. Yes! Yes!   Uh, I think so. Yeah. I don't remember him saying anything about this. You're keeping that money yourself?  Then why didn't you tell ''us''?! The only thing of yours that's larger in size is your big fat ass! Serves you right, Cartman! Yeah. No more getting pushed around by fourth graders!  Hey! We're fourth-graders now, too!  Ungh, gay, dude. You know, I heard our fourth-grade teacher is some new lady from Denver. He's right. We have to take a hard stance ''right now'' and establish that ''we're'' the dominant ones in this relationship!  ...Yeah. Or we could just show our asses. Together we are strong!  Whoa, dude, this is our new classroom? Holy God, dude! Yeah!  And did you see her lazy eye? You can't even tell what she's looking at. I just didn't think it would come so soon. Huh? Wow! I had already forgotten how great third grade was. How? Oh yeah, time travel. Well, what about those two college guys next door to me? They're always doing science experiments in their basement. So can you do it? I can't wait until the teacher yells at us this time, and we all tell her to suck our balls! Dude! Timmy's chair is packed with all that stuff! We've gotta help him! Come on!  What?! Timmy! You've got to get off that chair!  No?? Oh no! What have we done?! What do you mean, "can't"?! You made it work; just build us another one! Yeah! Timmy's probably back in third grade right now living it up! Wouldn't it be better to just agree with him and forget the whole thing? Look. You guys built a machine together that can bend time. If you'll just agree with him, you can build another one and usher in a whole new era of science! Yeah. And you know, now that I think about it, third grade wasn't all that great, either. Yeah! You suck, Cartman!  Hey, Timmy's back! Ike is starting his first day of kindergarten. Yeah, but he's some kind of genius, so he's getting advanced placement in kindergarten.  and it's all covered with pictures from ''Dawson's Creek''. Goddammit, Cartman! You only got that because you knew my mom would buy it for me! He's going to kindergarten because he's a genius! He's smarter than you, fat boy! I don't even know how you made it into fourth grade! I thought-- Nobody gives a crap about your Trapper Keeper, Cartman!  You are? I'm gonna shove that thing up your ass! No, I don't! I don't care! Oh, you are so full of crap, Cartman! Metal spikes will not come out! I'm gonna! I will!  Damn! I thought fourth grade was gonna be different. Whoa, dude..! Man, I guess sometimes we let our technology and stuff grow too fast. That should do it. Cartman, you dumbass! You can't ''get'' a new one! Don't you get it?! You can't have any Trapper Keepers, fat ass! Hey! What are you doing? Oh... Okay. Yeah, that'd be faster. Here we go again.  Dammit, Cartman, open up! Cartman?  He's not gonna open it. Break it down. Okay. Ready? One, two, three, not it! You ba--!  Why is ''that'' bad? Step on it, Bill Cosby!  Not-- Aw, damnit..!  I'm going to try and break you away from the computer, Cartman. I need to remove the CPU. Screw you, fat ass! Cartman!  No! I can't reach the CPU. Got 'em! I am sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Keller, but I'm afraid your daughter Helen still cannot see, hear, or speak. Can we take a lunch break now? What is it, Butters? We ''can't'' be outdone by the kindergartners! Revamp how? The rules are that the fourth grade class ''has'' to perform the Helen Keller Story. Okay! A smart one, that can do tricks. Uh, Timmy, if we back to the other kids with that turkey they're gonna be pissed! What?! Aw, dude, don't say that! Alright, we'll take him. How much? But you were just gonna take it out in the backyard and put a bullet in its head!  Aw, blow it out your ass! It's a turkey.  His name is Gobbles. Um, we... sssort of spend all the money on this... one... I didn't do ''anything'' to you. Timmy saw the turkey and wanted to get it. What do you want me to say to him?  Look, I know it isn't exactly what we wanted, but maybe we can train it. Timmy, we already ''got'' a turkey. Dude, don't forget: Timmy is the only kid who can play Helen Keller. Don't piss him off. What Butters?  So wait. Do we do that spin-around thing on the last beat? You ready for the big show, Timmy? Cartman, where's Timmy's turkey? He's gone, dude! Butters says he saw him leave.  Dude, it just can't be better than ours. It ''just can't be.'' Butters told us their play was awesome!  Aw, don't be such a baby!  You do it, Kenny. Come, on, Kenny! I'll give you five bucks to do it!  Hey, Kenny. How much for you to eat this? I'll give you ten bucks to eat it. Come on, dude. All you gotta do is eat it very fast!  What's the matter? Uh oh. I guess we shouldn't have made him eat it.  Aw, dude! You can still kinda see the spleen!  How much, Kenny? I'll give you five bucks to eat your puke. That's 19 bucks, Kenny!  Kick ass, dude! Yeah. People are willing to pay big money to see Kenny do this stuff. Whoa!  What did they do with all the fat? There must have been enough to last an Eskimo family months. Dude. I don't know if I'm going to like the new Eric Cartman. Good point.  Huh? Why not? I don't know. Why? Cartman, what the hell's the matter with you?  Alright, Ms. Crabtree. Is it comf'table enough? Six hours. Great. For what? Three months?! But the pay-per-view is tomorrow!  He worked so hard, come so close. Now we'll ''never'' see Kenny crawl up into Ms. Crabtree's uterus. ...Alright, that does it!  I knew it! You're not Cartman at all! Don't worry, dude. You're gonna do great. Oh, you're doing it, or else we're gonna bust your whole scheme wide open, and tell your mom you haven't actually been at your drug rehab this whole time! Yeah. They've kinda killed Kenny -'s look-alike. You bastards! Come on. Throw the football, Ike. Hepatitis B? ...You got Raging Pussies tickets??  Mom, Dad, can I go with the guys to see the Raging Pussies? But all the ''guys'' are going! But Mom, I- Ugh!  My parents said I can't go.  Ah. Oh, now I already told them. No! It's alright! Just give me some time to work on them. I'll see you guys later.  ...But what if I do a bunch of chores around the house? Come on, you're being unfair! What's Cuba? And do I have to shovel the whole driveway, or just the side the car is on? Hoh, geez.  Dear Mr. Castro:  I am an eight-year-old American boy who lives in South Park.  I did it! Now I can go to the Raging Pussies!  What?? But I did! Ah, I brought democracy to Cuba! But that's not fair! You lied to me! What I understand is that you totally screwed me over!! So why should I have to listen to you?! Well I wish I didn't have any parents!  It's so unfair! How can my parents do that to me?! They're evil! I WISH I DIDN'T HAVE ANY PARENTS! How?! What's that?  Wow! Three months without parents! Who cares? My parents deserve whatever they get. They're liars and cheats.  "My parents molestered me." What's "bad touch"? Okay, molestered, bad touch. Cool, thanks. ...Nothing. Not one adult left?  The fatass. The mayor. Because we do. It was like this yesterday, and the day before that. Sure, outlander. I'll get it  Parents. Mom. Dad. Yeah. I guess their rules did have a point. Things have gotten a lot worse in the ten days since they've been gone. Here's our cell phone, dude.  Do you think they're gonna pissed at us for lying that they molested us and sending them all to jail for ten days? Did you make it to your job interview? Well, thanks for everything, you guys. You really helped us see how important parents are. Mom! Dad! Yeah. We're fine. But you didn't do anything to me.  But, you guys, I-- Huh. Sure.  He's gonna be here any minute, Ike. Heee might not come if you're too close to the toilet bowl, Ike.  Just let us stay up a little longer, mom. Mr. Hankey's gotta show up. He always does. Happy Chanukah, Mom.  Go away!  Stan! Go get the other guys and tell them to meet me at the bus stop in ten minutes! Okay, good. You're all here. It's Mr. Hankey! He hasn't shown up yet. It's only three days until Christmas, you guys! You know how bad things have been around here. I think it might be because Mr. Hankey hasn't come. If you guys want there to be a Christmas, you'd better come help me!  Dude, you sneezed on my back! Hey, look.  Hello? ...Mr. Hankey! Hoh, we were so worried! I was waiting up for you and you didn't come, so I thought that- But where have you been? Things aren't the same without you. Nobody seems to have the Christmas spirit. A family! So THAT's why you haven't been able to spread Christmas cheer. Sure we'll help!  Jesus, this sucks! All they keep doin' is dancing around! Hey, that's it. Oh, my God, that's totally it!  It's so simple!  How hard can it be? Look at it.  Mayor! We have the solution to your problem. We're gonna make a short animated Christmas card that everyone can watch and play it on the screen at the old drive-in.  You guys go tell Butters to start making the cutoouts. I'm gonna go tell Mr. Hankey the good news!  Ah, Mr. Hankey?  We got the money, Mr. Hankey. We're gonna make our animated Christmas card. Well, I've gotta go start our animation. We've only got two days.  Alright, Butters. Let's see what you've got. They kind of look like us.  I mean, Stan's got blue eyes and I've got a sharper nose, but I mean, they ''kinda'' look like us. God job, Butters. See ya!  No ending? Well, we can't animate until we have our voices recorded, so we'd better just record what we have and figure out the ending later.  What's a hard p? Oh, yeah. <poem><i>We wish-</i></poem>  What? Well, yes, I think so.  Don't you oppress me, fat boy. Then don't belittle my people you fuckin' fatass! Check it out, dude. The camera shoots one frame at a time. So, all we gotta do, is put the right mouth on, according to what syllable they're pronouncing at that frame. Yeah. So what's the first syllable? Okay. So we put little "woo" mouths on all our heads.  And then we shoot that for one frame. That's one twenty-fourth of a second of our movie already shot!  Now, the next mouth. Okay, where are the E-mouths? Okay. "Woo" mouths again? So how much done is that?  Jesus Christ! Okay. Okay, the shot is finally set up. Now shoot the O mouth for two frames.  Cartman!  Fine! We'll do it with out you! We'll dub his voice over. <poem><i>You love-</i></poem> <poem><i>-And I'll labor. </i></poem> <poem><i>You sit- </i></poem> <poem><i>-And I'll stand. </i></poem> You can do Cartman's voice, can't you? Nuh, you've gotta sound fatter. ''Cool!'' Now let's try the script! Oh, you're just saying that because he brings you candy. <poem><i>You wish-</i></poem> <poem><i>-And I'll whittle.</i></poem> <poem><i>You sit- </i></poem> <poem><i>-And I'll stand. </i></poem> <poem><i></i></poem> Cartman, what the hell are you doing here?! You quit! Okay, Mr. Hankey! What? Yeah, I think so.  What? <poem><i>Dreidel dreidel dreidel-</i></poem> All that hard work. But we spent it! All that work! Sure. Sh-sure, Mr. Hankey. What the-- They did it! They got it working!  ...We actually spoke—to '''''the''''' Brian Boitano. Heheh, we could make you say whatever we wanted. What?  Ah. Yeah. You did it, Mr. Hankey. You brought back the spirit of Christmas!  Hey man, if you're Jewish you get presents for eight days. Sega Dreamcast?? Hey, Chef.  (Nuh-uh.) (No way!)  (No I don't! Thank you.)

Heh, I got a loose tooth right here.  Yyep. Oo-one of mine came out not two hours ago. Wwell, heck no! Uh you can't have it. Why, I'm gonna stick it under-my pillow and get money from the tooth fairy. She gives me fifty cents a tooth. Well, uh, see ya, fellas.   Who's there? Who is that?! Hoh. Sorry, Miss Fairy. I didn't mean to gaze at you. I'm back to sleep now, see?   Well, oh gosh, I, I didn't think you'd be so fat. Yuh, yu-yes ma'am! Wuh-okay! You guys ready up there!? On your marks! Get set! Uh-go!

Well, sure, u-uh I'm a team player-uh, I guess. Huh-you mean to expect me to go out there and let all those... huhu-horny old men... have their way with my fragile person?? Well just what team is this anyway?! Well uuh-uuh-alright then.  Well, alright men. Here, here I come.  Hey, watch it!  Ho, I don't wanna! Can I go now? Well, Clyde was gonna come too, but he, he said his mom was makin' tacos for dinner and Clyde likes tacos a whole lot. Huh, where are we goin'? Oh well, we're busted.  I hope it's not too bloody; I'm wearin' my favorite pants. Wwuhuh-o-kay!  Ah, I can do it again. Ahah-oo well, alright then.  Uhwell, uhwhat are we eatin' then? Huh-I can't whistle if I eat too many crackers.  Eyou guys! Eyou guys! Uh we just thought of somethin'! Uhwell, uh what about the handicapped kid, uh-Timmy? No! I mean, poor Timmy's gonna go to hell! He can't confess his sins, 'cause all he can say is his name! Uh us too. Uh we saw a picture of a naked lady. We could see her whole beaver. He had sins that he didn't confess! Hey, there's a window in the back that's usually open.  He had sins that he didn't confess! Huh-Hallelujah! Jesus! Uh, we can help Timmy learn how to ice-skate, too. Well, buh wuh when we pull our pants down,  should we stand frontways or back? I mean, do we show 'er our... behinds, or-ar our w-wieners? Uh-uh, maybe we could stand like this , with our wieners pokin' through the back of our legs, you know, and give 'er a nice fruit bowl. Huhuh, look at all this stuff. Huh-it sure was. Oowuh how are we gonna do that? Does it hurt?  I don't wanna do it if it hurts. Or if it... makes you get all sticky. Yeh-hah. They don't even realize that "The Menagerie" originally ''was'' the pilot and ''later'' got split up into two episodes, eh ha ha. Ha ha.  Hahahaha, eh the, eh the dumbasses.  The kindergartners! I just came from ''their'' dress rehearsal. Hoh, it's good, you guys. It's ''real good!'' They got Pilgrim outfits! And Indian ones, too! They've got singing and dancing and boy you've never ''seen'' such a show! Why, it's a Thanksgiving extravaganza!  The kindergartners! They've got amazing stage effects. Pyrotechnics and what have yous. Why, it's a regular feast for the eyes! ...Wow, did you see that? They had a horse, too! Hey! Ours is still alive! I'll throw in a dollar! Huh-I'm in for five! Uh-here. Uh-you can scoop it up in my R. Kelly thermos.  Who-what's a hummer?? Hoh, hahh, can I- help you folks? Oh, well-l-l, uh, I'm the mec-hanic, I guess. Woh-what seems to be the problem? No, uh Craig's here, too. But he's playing Spaceman right now. Huh. Hey, Craig!  Huuuhhhh, no. Phone here doesn't work. Haa-I'm afraid the only phone that ''does'' work... is over in Treasure Cove. Uhh rrreeally are you sure? Oh, alright then.  Uh, show 'em where it is. I think I found the problem, ma'am. A broken window roller-upper. Oo what the heck are you talkin' about? Oh, I'm gonna be sacrificed to the Provider! I'm here for you, Provider! Uh, take me!  Oh boy, here it comes! Hey, uh, what are you doin'?? Ha-I'm ready to give myself to Mr. Elway. Hey! Here they come!  Oo-what the heck are you talkin' about?  Huh, well, okay. Now, don't expect too much with the budget you gave me. Well, alright. Here's a little paper construction of Santa Claus.  Woh, ah, hey! I made a little cutout version of me, too! Ih in case you need it for your animated film. Uh-m, alright, alright then.  You what?  Dentist office. Oh, yes, Ms. Cartman. What can I do for you? Well, losing baby teeth is a natural thing, Ms. Cartman. How many has he lost? ...A hundred and twelve. Your son wouldn't happen to be an "alligator," would he? No? Hm, I see. Well, I'm afraid I can't help you right now. The American Dental Association convention is this week, but, as soon as I get back, I'll look into it. What? Fellow dentists: As you all know, we are still having numerous reports of missing teeth from all over the country. There are also reports of missing tooth fairy money. We believe that there can be only one logical reason for all of this. , and that it- ...Yeah. Weh well, by all means, Mr. Foley, enlighten us! Oh, Mr. Foley, you realize how ridiculous that sounds. Where?! And where, pray, is this "Montreal"?! Uhyub-dub very well, Mr. Foley, you go on your wild goosechase and meanwhile, we'll deal with the real problems at hand.   Anyway, the half-chicken/half-squirrel would most likely be about three to four-and-a-half feet tall. His large beak is probably detachable, and works as a flotation device. Well, I told you!   What? Oh. Kyle, let's have a little talk.  No. Kyle, she's just make-believe. Like Peter Pan. Kyle... Well, they were probably real. Probably not. Look, Kyle, adults make up those things because they're fun for children. It sure did. It's so wonderful to be on the same wavelength as our kids. Oh my God!   Hey, boys, how's the research coming? Oh, uuhh. I don't know.  Oh, those weren't mints, those were antacid tablets. Very good, Ike. That's two John Steinbeck books in one day. Kyle, it's all about being a good person now! You see, Christians use hell as a way to scare people into believing what they believe. But to believe in something just because you're afraid of the consequences if you ''don't'' believe in something is no reason to believe in something. Understand?  Oh yeah, I got a great angle here. Good idea. That's what being young is all about. The answer is no, Kyle! A communist country run by a dictator named Fidel Castro. Kyle, your mother and I don't want you going to the Raging Pussies concert! We gave you a chore that we thought was impossible. You weren't supposed to actually do it. Kyle, perhaps we handled this wrong, buh- but you need to understand that we don't want- Because we're your parents! Hello, honey, how has prison been for you? Eh, neither did we. Oh, that's disgusting!!! Now, now stop this!! I don't have any urges! Kyle, we're so sorry for the horrible sexual abuse over the years. But we're all better now. Hup, we did. We've come to terms with it through therapy and learned to admit it.  We're gonna sneak a tooth under this rich kid's pillow, then come back and collect the tooth fairy money that his parents leave him. Look, this is ''our'' turf! You'd better scram before the Boss breaks your legs! Alright, that does it! Come on, we're going to see the Boss! Loogie. Right on our turf, Boss! I ain't ever seen that kind of disre-  Erp. Ha! You guys don't even know how the tooth trade works! Rowwr! Alright, kid. Time to die.  Yes, Mommy. Yes, Mommy. Woohoo, let's go sledding, let's go race and race, let's go!    They tricked us again, huh? They always get us. Sometimes it's a ice cream truck, sometimes it's a taco stand. But they always fool us.  Why not?! What the hell are you talking about?! We've been doing this for over two years! Oh, nice going! Now you woke him up!   This is your last chance, kid! Either you give the boss his cut, or else we're gonna throw your pal into the river wearing concrete galoshes! He's not gonna do it?! He's not gonna do it, boss! Oh, man, how deep is the Platte River? Hi, Mom. Grounded? Oh, no! Um, wait...  Nice tooth fairy costume. You think anybody'd believe you in that?! How dare you!   Oh! It's the tooth fairies! I don't have any loose teeth, Miss Fairies but I ''have'' been a very good boy. Shut up! Aww. ''Lord, Lord, Lord''  My associates here tell me you were working Cherry Creek tonight. Is that true?  I do it just like my big brother before me, and my oldest brother before that. Let me ask you something: You were gonna sneak a tooth under this rich kid's pillow? Then what? How are the kid's parents gonna know there was a tooth under their child's pillow?  Look, any shmuck can sneak through a window wearing a pretty dress. The tooth racket is much more involved.  And the kids never know what hit 'em. The hardest part is getting teeth. We tried various places. Cemeteries  The teeth we do manage to acquire are then sorted according to size, color, and quality.  But there's never enough teeth. Never enough. And now my only problem is, what do I do with you?  Tell you what: how would you like to run the South Park tooth racket for me? It's that, or else I can cut off your penises.  I'll cut you in at 2%. They're ''what''?! They're not gonna pay me? Who the hell do they think they are? I want those South Park kids dead! I want their families dead! I want their houses burned to the ground!  Oh, hi there, Mister. My mommy and daddy are out front, if you need 'em. Sit down, Mr. Foley. Do you want some spaghetti? I told the ADA a thousand times: I know nothing about teeth. I'm just an 8-year-old boy who likes climbing trees and playing in puddles. Well then, throw him in.   Well, well, well. What do we have here? Did you bastards really think you could hide from me forever? Kolovski  Aw, drat!  It was a trap! Jesus! The little sick kid was a setup all along!  How could I be so stupid?! I can't believe I fell for such an obvious trap! What the hell is wrong with me?! Oh well. Maybe it's good my empire has fallen. Yeah. I kinda wanted to play in the flag football team this year anyways. Naah. In a way, I'm just glad the whole thing's over with. Wow! Nooo!   Uh, excuse me? I think I have a more logical theory. I think what we've got here is some kind of black-market tooth racket. Something where one group is stealing the money and teeth from another group for a profit.  It's not ridiculous. It's very possible. I've seen it happen before. In Montreal.   Look, I know how to handle this. All we have to do is bring down the kingpin and the rest will fall. You'll see! I'll have it taken care of in a matter of weeks! Well, I will!  Let's cut the crap, kid. My name is Tom Foley. I'm with the American Dental Association.  No thanks, I just brushed. I just wanted to let you know that I'm onto you. I ''am'' going to find out who the boss is! And when I do I'm gonna bust his ass and everyone's ass who helped hide his ass!   Perfect. The trap is set.  If this sting operation works, some bogus tooth fairies should be showing up to take the sick kid's money. When they touch the kid's pillow, an alarm will sound, and that's when you hit the button, Murphy, and activate the lights. Everybody got it? Alright. Everyone, keep your eyes peeled.  Let's move out!  Give it up, kids. You're surrounded by dentists. That's right. And now it's all exposed! You're through! The only thing left to do is to haul all you kids down to prison!  What the hell? Let's get outta here!   Denver. Yeah, that's right. Aghh...  Yeah.  Daddy, why did Mommy leave and go to heaven? But I miss her.   So am I. The story of the before time. Bwack bwack! Hello there, children. Oh. Well, uh, I'm afraid that the school charges extra for that.  Oh my God! There has got to be at least fifteen dollars here! Well! Look at you cute little crackers! With your money and your fancy clothes and your cell phones, it's almost like you were-  Oh my God, children! What have I told you about drugs?! That's right. And the only thing worse than doin' drugs is dealin' drugs! I'm gonna tell you about when ''I'' was your age and got offered drugs.  Uh? You're not? Oh, uh weh-ell, children, whatever you're doin', just remember this: havin' money may seem fun, but...  Ooh, uh-oh, never mind. ''Damn'', that little Amanda was fine! I'm gonna look her up.  Hello there, children. How's it goin'?  Everything's fine?? Why?? What?? So ''that's'' why all you children are acting so damned boring! Damnit, children, you don't need drugs to make you pay attention in school! In my day, if we didn't pay attention we got a belt to the bottom! Now they're tryin' to cure everything with drugs! Oh, it makes me sick! Those damned psychologists prescribe all kinds of medicines to you children without even carin' about the side effects. Parents, I called you all together because I think you might be making a mistake puttin' your children on Ritalin.  I know you wanna help your kids, but I brought over a videotape to show you that there are alternative' to Ritalin. There's this doctor in Northern California who is doin' real amazing things with kids who have ADD. I want you to watch this tape.  Well, what do you think? I can have Dr. Shay come to South Park for a small fee. What the...? Dammit! Have you all been taking your children's Ritalin too?! Awww, fudge it!  The what? Hold on a second: you children ''want'' to go see Phil Collins? Oh my God!! That does it! That Ritalin has affected your little cracker brains too deeply! I'm going to go see that damn pharmacist!  Yes you can! What the hell are you two doin' prescribing all the children Ritalin?! I know what it is! But now you've got a town full of zombie children from the planet Zandor. All around the country, you bastard doctors are giving children Ritalin! And for every one child that actually needs it, you give it to 50,000 that don't! You're damn right I'll tell you yo' business, because you two have got your heads up your asses! Thanks to you, we have children in our town that like Phil Collins! That's right! You've made them so dull and boring that they're actually going to go to a Phil Collins concert! Well, how do we reverse the Ritalin?! Then we need an antidote! Alright. Come on, we've got to get the antidote to all the children. Quick!    Come on, drink it down. It's free.  She's gone! Thank God!  I think it's working. Mayor, as I've said before, I find that flag to be ''racist and insensitive!'' That flag represents a time when blacks were persecuted by whites! How can a black man ''not'' be bothered by it?! You don't see anything wrong with that flag?! Yeah! Look, I have gone to every quiet protest I could! I have written everyone; I've put up signs! But now I'm telling you , THIS FLAG WILL BE CHANGED! Sign up to join me, and come marching to the Mayor's office in protest of the South Park flag!  Randy! Sign up to march with me against the South Park flag on Wednesday? Well, alright, Marsh, you're entitled to your own opinion.  That's how it is in this town. I haven't gotten one signature on this damn sheet, and I've been here all day! That's nice, but I need the support of some registered voters.  Ey, Mackey! Sign up to march on Wednesday? Alright, fudge it, Thursday. Anyone else wanna go Thursday? Fine! Next Sunday! Monday?? Okay! On Saturday, we march! To bring down the South Park Flag!  My name isn't Chef anymore, children. I've converted to Islam. From now on, my name is  With everyone in town so insensitive about the flag, I find it no longer fitting to use my slave name! You WHAT?!  You don't think they should change the flag?!  Well, that figures you don't! Because your cracker-ass parents turned you into little cracker-ass cracker-racists! I never thought I'd live to see this many of the people I considered friends turn against me! But nothin'!  Change the flag!  Change the flag! Change the flag!…  Change the flag! No, damnit!  How can you all just stand by and let these racists do this?!  Aw, to hell with all of you indecisive bastards! I ain't gonna listen to nothin'! This whole cracker-ass town can kiss my ass!   Whoa whoa whooaa! You just missed the point entirely! I'm not mad because the flag shows somebody gettin' killed, It's because it's racist! Children, don't you even know what this argument is about?! That flag is racist because a black man is being hung by white people. Ooooooohhh?! But that's a ''black'' man up there! Well of ''course'' it matters when-  …Oh my God. Wait a minute. You children didn't even see the flag as a black man being hanged by white people, did you?  Why, that is- that is the most beautiful thing I have ever heard. Don't you see? All this time I thought these little crackers had turned racist, when actually they were so ''not'' racist that they didn't even make a separation of black and white to begin with. All they saw when they looked at that flag was five people. I'm sorry, children. I was wrong about you. But I still the flag needs to be changed. But now I realize that I almost let racism turn ''me'' into a racist. Oh, I know you don't, Jimbo. I've known you for almost ten years. You're a good man. I think that's a much better start than me tryin' to separate myself from all you wonderful crackers. Hooray!  Oh! Oh-h, hello Eric. Wellll, if you uhhh, come back in just a little bit, Eric, I'll see if I can help you out.   Alright, Eric, what's the matter? Well, Eric, I, I think you were just focusin' in on the wrong thing. Boy bands aren't about music, boy bands are created by corporations to make money. They're all based on the Gomlich effect. The law of physics that states, "If one girl screams for something, it will make other girls scream. And then, it grows exponentiously until all girls within a five-mile radius are screaming." All they do is make videos, showing tons and tons of girls screaming for the boy band. Once you get girls screaming, you can't stop 'em. They're crazy!  You're welcome. Now, go away! A-and a cucumber in the pants never hurt either! What's the problem? You call that a problem? That sounds like heaven to me. Oooo! Call the doctor! Uuuh, Ms. Choksondik, Mr. Garrison had several uuh, eee-motional issues. He was a closet homosexual who hated gay people. Whenever someone asked him if he was gay, he'd go nuts. Some say that on cold nights you can still hear him moanin', "I'm not gaaay! I'm not gaaay!" You know I'm always here to help, Principal Victoria.   Hello there, children!  For once, can't you just come in here and say, "Hi Chef. Nice day, isn't it?"!  It sure is! Thank you. Uh uh! You children are gonna get me in trouble with the principal again. Oh my God. Eric? Why do you need to know what a prostitute is anyway?! Well, no, uh of course Kenny is not a prostitute. Well, because, children, a prostitute is someone who... you could pay for certain services. Like keeping you company. Understand? <poem><i>And that's why I say-</i></poem> Oohhhh  ...These children tricked me! Hey, Chef. That there's a time and a place for everything, and it's called "college." Thanks, Chef.  Ahhhh. Aaaaah!  Whoa!   Aaaaaah! Yeah. Yeah! Awww. Alright! 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1  . It's all top-grade stuff, too.These Chinese kids are selling their teeth for peanuts, see? Well, huh, Tang Li wants 30, but, but I can cut you a deal for 28, yeh ha, buh. Heh, ha-buh, what do you say, huh?   Awuh, hawuh, why, sure, sure. Huh? ...to which Ms. Clinton replied, "I don't even like Vagina." Finally tonight, a human-interest story. Dan Akawa is live. A car chase is evolving on the 285 corridor east of South Park! Hate-crime suspect Eric Cartman is trying to outrun federal prosecutors in his friend's Go-Go Action Bronco! Our Eye in the Sky Greg Nimins is there live. Greg? Here's Lalapalalala's news. The hit group Timmy has broken up. And so, Phil Collins is back on as the headliner. The opening band now will be Timmy's guitarist Skyler's new solo project, Reach for the Skyler.  Louder, Billy, we can't hear ya! Well, that's a lot of money.How the hell are you gonna get all that in the short amount of time you have left? Well, Billy, I also understand that you lost a tooth today. Billy, we want you to put that tooth under your pillow tonight, because we have a feeling that the tooth fairy  is going to leave you six hundred dollars for it! Yes, really.  How was that?   Duh six hundred dohollars. Well, I a-I don't know. Yehahah. Really? Okay-y, Mom.   G'night, Mom. G'night, Dad. I'm going to bed now, Mommy. I put my tooth under the pillow. Do you really think the tooth fairy will give me money for the transplant? Well, I can't wait to feel healthy and strong again.  Really? I think so, Billy. I think so. Naw, come on. D'ya really think anyone will fall for somethin' that stupid? Be sure to put your loose tooth under your pillow, Billy. Got it.  Just kidding. You know how there's always the dumb guy in sting operations in the movies? I was, you know I was actin', I was actin' like him, eheh, oh. Eh something strange is happening with the computers.  This is reality! I am everywhere , and nowhere.  Ready! That's not fair! Cartman's ass is so fat he makes your sled go faster! Yeah! And with Cartman's enormously fat ass, the boys are ''sure'' to win! Oh!  No. Yeah. Yeah.  If somebody kills somebody, it's a crime. But if someone kills somebody of a different color, it's a hate crime.  And motivation for a crime shouldn't affect the sentencing.   What are we gonna do?!  Hey, what are you guys doin'? Yeah, a turkey that could do tricks. Yeah, that turkey sucks. But what are we gonna do? Six! We want to use the sleds now, butt pirates! These are the ''school's'' sleds, ass rammers, not yours! I bet we can sled ten times better than you, doughnut punchers! How about a race down a ''real'' hill, then?! Your best four sledders against our best four sledders! Then we'll see you this Saturday on Phil Collins Hill! See you there! And may the best woman win, turd burglars!  Just a friendly reminder: Cartman's going to jail and you've got four days until the race, rump rangers!  See you Saturday, poo sniffers!   Well, come on! Are we racing or not?! Come on, my feet are getting cold, fudge packers! Okay, girls. Time to show the boys what we can do! This is your last chance! Are we racing or not?! We've got' em, girls! G'aaaaah!  Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah. Those girls don't realize what good sledders Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are. Huh? I'm not fat.  Hey, I'm ''not fat'', you guys. I'm just kind of big-boned. So I don't get to be on the team now?  Right here. For the last time, I'm not fat, so stop calling me fat, God-damnit!  Oh, thank you! Thank you for coming back!  Thank you so much. Thank you. Right.  Yeah. If we died right now, we'd have unclean souls and we'd burn in hell.  ...We've gotta get to that church before ''we'' die. Like what?  Hey, Timmy might need some help pulling his pants down. Oh, no! Oh, now what? Well, we can add music numbers, but how do we make the Helen Keller story more Thanksgivingy? Tonight we present the story of a courageous girl and her fight against depression Oppression. Our play begins in a simpler time.  Oh.  That's the prettiest turkey I ever saw. Yeah, and it's from Broadway. We're never gonna outdo them now!  I've got three. And what you need to understand is that this is not appropriate behavior, young man! M'kay? Well, I hope you learned that throwing rocks at people is bad, Eric.  Not this time, Eric! You've got to learn to respect your little friends! You're gonna have detention for two weeks! Yes way! M'kay, and that settles it! Now, let's all go-  Yes? Nn-um. m'kay, uh, I've already taken care of it; Eric Cartman here is gonna be punished with two weeks of detention. Uh, oh, but I don't think this is a ruh- Oh no. Uh young man, if you don't wanna be held back a grade, I suggest you start cooperating, m'kay?! Huh- hold on just a second there, Principal Victoria.  Yes, of course.  I think maybe Timmy is suffering from something called, "Attention Deficit Disorder," or ADD. It's very common in kids his age. It should be easy enough to find out. They have tests for that kind of thing now, m'kay? M'kay.  Oh oh, I nuh-I knew it.  Okay, well, maybe you need to view this as a chance to do something you've always wanted to do. Well, there you go, m'kay? Well that's easy. Write about what you know. Write about what you love. What do you love most? Yes. M, m'kay Well that settles it, Mr. Garrison. What you need to do is go write a great romance novel. Oo, Wednesday? Uh-Wednesday's tough. I guess- maybe I could do somthin' uh, Thursday afternoon. Oh, yeah. Yeah, Tuesday morning's good. Yeah, I think that's the best day. ''Oh, Mrs. Cartman, I've been uh very bad. M'kay? [he's handcuffed against a brick wall. Mrs. Cartman appears as a dominatrix]'' ''Oh, yeah, that makes me hot, m'kay? [Cartman is shocked at what he sees; the manager is pleased]'' Uh, God is our refuge and strength, m'kay. A very present help in trouble, m'kay.  Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea... God is in the midst of her, m'kay. She shall not be moved, m'kay.   -m'kay. The God of Jacob is our refuge, m'kay.  Uh, you see, Chef, Ms. Choksondik has very large, uh, honkers, and she doesn't seem to like wearing a bra. No, it's really not as nice as you might imagine, Chef, m'kay.   We... don't like to talk about it. After being dismissed from teaching, he went off to write romance novels. His first novel sold well and everything was fine until he found out that his novel won the gay Pulitzer Prize, and was considered the best homoerotic novel since ''Huckleberry Finn''. Well, we really haven't ll-looked. What? Oh, that's great, Mr. Garrison. You've finally come to terms with yourself! Yeah, congratulations!  Every year the fourth graders do "The Miracle Worker," and every year I have to sit and watch it. Eric, your friends and your family are all... concerned about your weight. M'kay? Now, Eric, all these people came here and paid to send you to camp because they care about you. Uh what's all this about, Mrs. Cartman? Is Eric having trouble at his weight-management camp? Eric, that's fantastic, m'kay?! Christmas ''is'' about presents. If we all buy presents, everyone benefits. M'kay? Counselor Mackey? I'm Agent Sharp and this is Agent Keen. We're with  the FBI. Duhude, that handicapped dude ruhules! Oooh, free-range aspirin! You mean, during the ball game? You know what would be better for me is Saturday afternoon. Yeah. I know what I may like. I don't like marching. Do it again! Oho! Yeah! We're here to investigate the rock-throwing incident. New laws have been passed that make any crime based on race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation a federal offense.  We're sorry, Ms. Cartman, but we must follow protocol.  I'm afraid it's a bit more complicated than that, Mr. School Counselor. You see, since the victim in this case is African-American, this is considered  The hate crime trial of the century is underway . Live. Here's your host, Leslie Smith. You're watching MTV, the cool, brainwashing, twelve-year-old-and-younger station that hides behind a slick image. We're so cool that we decide what's cool. And now, MTV News, the news that is singlehandedly dumbing down our country. Which is cool. Here's your host, Kurt Loder.  Kurt Loder didn't just say that. No way, he ''did'' just say it, but just to be cool. That's what makes him cool. You think Kurt Loder is cool. And now, the news that's cool. You're watching VH1.  Ladies and gentlemen, please, no smoking and no flash-photography during Sarque du Son Bleu.  You'll be Rocky Mountain High with this, the most EXTREME, INSANE RIDE EVER BUILT.

''Previously on'' South Park''...'' ''And now the exciting conclusion of...'' South Park''.'' And now back to ''Jesus and Pals'', on South Park Public Access.  Whoa-ho ho! You heard him, folks! Kenny is going to give a sensual full-body massage to his own grandfather! This week on Pay Per View  stay there for six hours. Don't miss this once-in-a-lifetime event. Order now! Well, we've seen him do just about every disgusting thing in the book, and today live on pay-per-view, Krazy Kenny is going to crawl into a woman's uterus for six hours!  Well, Ms. Crabtree, your cervix has been dilated, your womb equipped with oxygen- How do you feel? Well, let's bring out the man of the hour, you know him as the- And here he is, Kenny McCormick!  He did it! Come on out, Kenny!  Well, he gave his life for our amusement. One little boy who dared to be different. Let us never forget... Kenny McCormick.  Who was that? What turns a normal, fat little eight-year-old boy into a vicious, hate-crime-committing racist? We take you live to the courtroom  as the defendant takes the stand. Mr. Cartman, do you know a boy by the name of "Tolkien?" Who is Tolkien?  Black?! Did you say black?! You called him black?! O!  He is African-American, and so you decided to pick him out! The rage built and built inside your head until it became too much because you hate African-Americans!! What? Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, this is why we have hate-crime laws! This "monster" committed a crime—not against an individual, but against a race! Do the democratic thing and send his fat little butt to prison!  The prosecution rests. We know! Oh. Hooray! Yup.  Me. Me. Me. Me. Hello, Chef. Kenny!  Eric Cartman, you have been found guilty of committing a hate crime. For this, I hereby sentence you to the Alamosa Juvenile Hall, until you turn twenty-one. I am making an example of you, to send a message out to people everywhere: that if you want to hurt another human being, you'd better make damn sure they're the same color as you are!  Bailiffs, escort this little bastard to Juvenile Hall.  Woohoo! Hooray! Yes, sir.  Alright, you! ...Uh-uh-uh, where'd he go?   Tom, it looks like the fugitive is going to make a bold move off an exit off 285. He's going into a residential neighborhood now; this is where it could get dangerous, as there are pedestrians about. Tom, the police have set a roadblock right where the Go-Go Action Bronco is heading.  This could be the final stand-off. Well, it's been over thirteen hours now, and still the car chase has not ended.  The chase has now moved through most of Arizona and nears the Mexican border.  Crazy son of a bitch. We're gonna make it, Kenny! We're gonna make it to Mexico!  Here we are, the end of the road. Alamosa Maximum Security Juvenile Hall.  'Kay. What's stuck to the bottom of the bus?  Oh, goodness! We must have run over a little Mexican further up north. Is it okay?  Well, here's fifty for the gas. ''[starts the bus and drives off] Adios.''  Can I interest you in some ice cream?  Hang on, we'll be back at camp in a matter of no time.  Prisoner 24601, arriving.   You don't have a choice, Stomper! Now, show this new prisoner the ropes!  And I don't want no new cellmate! Oh, I will!  You bet your ass I will. Well, well, well. New fish. How about you come up with a reason why we ''don't'' break your arms?! Oh yeah? The way I see it, there's two kinds of kids in the world: kids who like ''Animaniacs'', and kids who don't like ''Animaniacs''. You're either with us, or you're against us. So which are you?!  ...Neither do we No! There's no friends in the Big House! You come in with nobody and you leave with nobody. We don't believe in "friends." Now, go find me some cigarettes and I'll tell you how to bust out of here.  Well, did you get the cigarettes? Alright. Go sit on the toilet and poop them out. I'll keep an eye out for the guards.  You flushed them?! No way, douche. I told you: I ain't your friend. If you want me to help you, you're gonna have to sneak something else in for me.  Ew, it smells, man. You're ''not'' gonna break out of here! You're here 'til you're 21, douche! I just wanted you to sneak stuff in for me. What? You actually think I give a crap about you? Hneah. You'd better wise up to the way things work in the big house.  You... you can't cry in prison, man. They'll bust your head open. What's the matter with you?! Dude.  Look, if it's that important to you, I'll bust you out of here. Yeah. ...Yyeah, I will. Uh-but not because you're my friend. Only because... because I wanna bust out, too. Anh-anh, and see Disneyland. Hurry up! They're sending the dogs after us!  Mph. Oowww!  You go on ahead without me. Hey.  You're supposed to say, "I'm not going without you," or something. Look, kid, you go on. You've got something to live out there. You've got friends. I sure would have liked to have seen Disneyland. Here. I want you to have these.  No! You're supposed to say, "I can't take these," or something, dumbass! Take them. They'll bring you luck.  Yeah? Eric! Wow! I've never had a visitor before! You did?  Yeah.  Whoa!  Oh, yeah! Oh, the monorail! Yeah! Yeah! Oh, that's a wonderful idea. This is a sad day for men everywhere. Let's all hear it for Cartman's big, fat ass!   Wa-a-ah!  I'm an apprentice blacksmith.  Well, it's not for me to judge you, sir. We are all the same.  Waaah!  Lovely day, isn't it? Where? That's a lot of  money-loney. ...I've come to answer the want ad.  What?? Eho. After you, miss. I've come to answer the want ad, ma'am. Oh, no, no! You you sort of look upon one when you have not seen the sun for over 20 years quite a lot these... days.  Righty-o. What are we going to play?  Well, uh... I think she's very pretty. I think she's rather insulting.  Don't you wanna play anymore? Oho. Well, yes, miss. Oh, um, not so much as before.  Ow!  Oh, dear. Who is that? Oh I... rather thought I was.  Hoh, lovely. Joe, do you know anything about girls?  But, do you know anything about them? About how they work. Do you think that a girl who is rich and educated would ever want to be with a blacksmith? I'm Pip, sir. Oho. But it ''must'' be Ms. Havisham! Yes sir. Good-bye, sir. None, sir. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.  Mr. Pocket? Thank you kindly. You do look rather familiar My, how lovely. Oh it's... quite alright.  Lord bless me! Why, you're the pale young man I saw at Ms. Havisham's house! Perhaps, but perhaps not. Ms. Havisham is very generous indeed. Well, what do you mean? Pocket, may I ask you a favor? I am desperately trying to become a gentleman! For the love of a certain girl. So, will you please tell me if I do something wrong at the table?   Sorry! Sorry! Oh. Excuse me. At half nine, the time when she stopped all the clocks in the house. Terribly sorry, Pocket.   Thanks to you. Oh, my! She is even prettier than before.   I don't know. I mean, I think about her every day. Righto. Yes, but... where will I find her? Thank you, Ms. Havisham! For everything!  I'm the happiest boy in the land! Hello, Estella. Yes. I've become a gentleman. May I?  Well, I was sent to be schooled in London. Oh. I see Joe once in a while. But I don't have much in common with him anymore, now that I'm a gentleman and all.  It is wonderful to see you again, Estella. Because I believe I'm in love with you.  I think you do. I see past that, Estella. I see a little girl who wants to be warm and kind. Who...? Who is that? I see, and you... fancy this Steve fellow?  Boyfriend?? I don't understand! I did everything right! I stopped being a poor commoner! I even blew off my lovin' Joe! Ms. Havisham! You have to talk to Estella! She's going out with a-  Ms. Havisham! But um... But I don't understand.  You sent me away to become a gentleman so that ''I'' could be with Estella.  ...Well, I suppose that if you set out to break my heart, you did a very good job of it. Because it certainly does hurt. It's... a-as if... squeezing it very tightly. But why do you make your daughter hurt people?  Joe?  Oh, why would she have wasted all that time sending me to school and making me into a gentleman? Why, you're the escaped convict I helped a long time ago. You? But why? Oh, dear. All this time I thought it was Ms. Havisham. She totally let me believe it.  Well, I've certainly learned a lot. That being a gentleman doesn't mean learning to dance, or proper table manners. It means being a gentle man. Gentle to ''everyone.'' And now I suppose there's only one thing left to do. If Ms. Havisham is determined to do this to others, let's go KICK HER ARSE! Not so fast, you ugly ancient bitch. You won't get away with this!  Pocket! Get over there, and do whatever it takes to keep those blokes from crying!  Come, Estella! You can't want to be part of this.  Estella! Listen to me! You are a wonderful girl, with a kind heart. But you do! And I shall prove it to you once and for all!  Look at this adorable little bunny. You see that? A heartless person wouldn't care at all about this bunny. They'd just as soon break its neck.  ...Right. Nine. Nine baby bunnies. A person with a heart could never kill ''nine'' baby bunnies. So you ''do'' have too big a heart to-  Ten baby bunnies! Twenty-six baby bunnies What? There! You see?! You ''do'' have a heart!  You're released from her now, Estella! Now we can begin our life together! Shut up, fatass! Yeup. Woopee! Wo-o-o-o-oh!  Oh?  Huh? Hooray! Alright! Here we go! And have you been brushing your teeth? And not dropping your soap? Young man, that is the fourth time you've been late for our visiting time; you are grounded.  Here you go, boys. Keep it short.  But ''you've'' been pardoned by the governor!  Hey! Romper Stomper! Get up!   Hello? Well, his head is still a little sore, but you can come in, if you like.  I'm afraid it's not that simple, boys. No. You see, the only person that can let Eric out of Juvenile Hall is the governor. No, I'd, actually agree with you. Yeah. I have a real problem.with hate-crime legislation. In fact, I'd love to see you kids go down and give the governor a piece of my mind. Oh, he wouldn't listen to me. Because I'm black. Sit down, boys. I'm gonna give you a little lesson about hate-crime laws.  Governor, the Free Eric Cartman Now Committee is here to see you? I... used to believe in miracles.  Naw, not another committee. Send them in.  This is the Free Eric Cartman Now Committee? Well, boys, what can I do for you? Hm. That made the most sense of any presentation I've heard in the last three years. Yeah. If you're too scared to race, just say so! Sure, what?  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! Why would you tell me this? Why would you tell ''anyone'' this? Alright, look. When two people work closely for a long time, sometimes they feel what's called, "sexual tension." Sometimes you just have to act on impulse and get it over with. Kiss him and get it out of your system. Are we gonna get paid now, or after? We wouldn't give a rat's ass if Leonardo DiCaprio came walking past us. Oh... Okay.  Okay, so where's our money? Let's go ice-skating.  Hello. My name is Anne Sullivan, and I believe I can teach this child to communicate.  Water, Helen! Waaa-terr! Her feathers are beautiful.  Water, Helen. It has a name. Oh, why can't you understand? <poem><i>Water, Helen, Water.</i></poem> <poem><i>Helen, Helen. Water, Helen.</i></poem> Yes, that's it.  That's it, Helen. Water! WA-TER! She did it! I've got three. Yeah! Hooray!  Hooray! Go, fatass!  Go! You can do it! Come on! Rowr. ''{carries Lizzy away]'' Awww.   Ahhh. Wow. Woohoo. Yay. ...Matt Lauer. '''''AAAGGGGHHH!'''''  Yea!  Hooray! <poem><i>Even a miracle- </i></poem> Naah. Okay, children, I hope you all did your homework last night, because we're goin' to talk about pages 42 through 612. First of all, who can tell me what year the Founding Fathers got together?  Let's see, how about... Wendy? Good job, Wendy. And what was that document called?  Kyle? Very good, Kyle. Now, who can tell me what famous person ''wrote'' the Declaration of Independence?  No, it wasn't you, Timmy. Try again. Timmy, did you not do your homework?! Don't call people names, Stanley! Now, Timmy,— —You need to work on your study skills! Are you mocking me?! Because if you are, I have no problem sending your butt to the principal's office! THAT DOES IT! Hurry up, children, let's take our seats.  A note from the principal? "Please excuse Timmy from all questions and all homework, as he has been diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder."  Oh, brother! That's just swell, Timmy! Looks like you've outsmarted the principal and the counselor! Very well, I guess you're excused from homework. Okay, children, let's settle down!  Well, dammit, Eric, don't you have some smartass thing to say?!  This is driving me crazy!! I can't handle you little bastards being so mellow!!  Haah! Eric! Oh, crap! Huh-uh, nothing! Nothing!   Hey uh, uh, uh. Good thing you guys came. This... little boy was trying to have his way with me. No-o! I'm telling you, this is all a terrible mistake, Officer Barbrady. O-ogh!  Eat me, pervert! I did not want love from a young boy! I like men my own age.  Aah! I mean, I like women! What did I say?-Oh God! I love titties! Aw, damnit, I'm in the wrong place.  What?? Well, who cares about a guy that makes beer?! Jesus Christ, I'm trying to teach history!  Oh, whatever! That was not me, that was Mr. Hat!   Gentlemen, teaching is all I know. It is the air that I breathe.  Oh, sorry. So I can keep it then?'' [grabs back his revolver]''  I don't know what I'm goin' tuh do, Mackey. Teaching is all I know. I've always wanted to write a novel. But I never know what to write about. Besides teaching? ...Poontang. I can't help it. I'm a womanizer sometimes, I know, but I just think that... taking a woman home and getting some hot poon is about the greatest thing in the world. Yes, that's it.  I am going to write the Great American Romance Novel! Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, did you read the book? Well, what did you think? Ooohhh, why not? Well, I'm sure there's lots of naughty words. It is a romance novel. No? What the hell are you talkin' about?! Well, I thought it was mostly women that read these things! Well, women want to read about ding-dongs! D'you think women care about the details of female anatomy?! Hell no! Women wanna read about big, powerful schlongs!  Look, I've seen women read these things. They skim along and skim along until they get to the part about the penis! That's what they want, so that's what I'm giving them!  Boys, I have an announcement to make: I'm not gonna be your teacher anymore. I've become a best-selling author! And Kyle, I want you to have a signed copy as a get-well present.  NO, no,   White Power! White Power! Ogh! You're such a racist bastard, Mr. Hat.  Oohh, I'm sorry, Chef. Mr. Hat is a racist son of a bitch.  Don't apologize for me to that ''spearchucker!''  Mr. Hat, what do you think you're doing?  There's another Klan rally tonight; I have to be there in 15 minutes. Ooh no, Mr. Hat. You are not dragging to another Klan meeting.  But they're electing a new assistant to the Grand Dragon. I might get elected. Well, good for you, Puppet Pants! I'll have nothin' to do with it!  I'm going whether you like it or not! Oh yeah?!  Mi-Mr. Hat?  Iii'mmm nnnooottt gggaaayyy!!! Who-? Who are you? What do you want?  Do you know what it is to be a teacher, Ms....? No, I don't!  IT'S A LIE! You see? That's what you get for bein' a teacher! You work and you work for the children and then people start rumors that you're gay even though you love poontang! ...Two hundred bucks. Alright, let's try it again. "But teacher, I don't want to do my math problems." "Well, I'm not ''gong' '' to do it, teacher! You can just suck my balls!" NOOO! Look, you can't counter a profane command with an idle threat! You must extinguish it with a vulgar suggestion! When a child says, "Suck my balls," you say, "Present them." Now, let's try it again.  SUCK MY BALLS!  You're ready to move on to the next level. But I warn you: we will now be diving deep into your own psyche. These children know what scares you, and so we, too, must face those demons.  You will be. This is it: The Tree of Insight. You must go in and face what lives inside. Hell if I know. I wouldn't go in there.  Haaa! Who? Who are ''you''?  I'm as gay as a gymnast on shore leave!  Yeah, it feels really good! You know, I, I feel like I can start anew. If it's alright with you, I'd like to go back to teaching the third grade!  No, that's right, it's not. Well, let's start with roll call. Uh, let's see. Filmore Anderson? Sally Bands? Ike Broflovski? Broflovski, I had your older brother Kyle in my third-grade class. He's a very smart kid. I'm sure you are, too.  And that's how the relationship with my father sort of ended. There's still some sort of skeletons in the closet, but things between us are a little better.  Who would like to nominate someone? Okay, Filmore.  Yes, Jenny. In a minute, Jenny. Who else wants to nominate a class president?  Oh, come on! You can't have an election with just one person running! What's the fun in that? Ike? How about you? You're a genius. Okay, our second nominee is Ike the genius.  Okay, children, now we'll hear briefly from each nominee. Filmore, why don't you go first? Very enthralling. Okay, Ike? How about you? ...Well, this is gonna be a tough one, kids. So that's six votes for Filmore and six votes for Ike.  You've got the winning vote, Flora. Who d'you pick? Flora, you have to pick one. Filmore or Ike? Oh, great! Flora's undecided! Well, you're just gonna have to sit there, Flora, and think about it until you come up with an answer. Oh, for Christ's sakes, you're all acting like a bunch o' kids!  Alright, who do you vote for?  Okay, so then the total is six for Filmore and now seven votes for Ike. Ike is the new class president.  What? Oh, of all the juvenile things I've ever heard! You lost, Filmore! Don't be such a baby!  ...And this time, I again get six votes for Filmore and seven votes for Ike. No, children! I've recounted 106 times now and I keep coming up with seven to six! Except in the one instance where it came out seven to five, and one where it came out twelve to fourteen. '''''It's over!''''' Ike is class president! Oh, will you grow up?! Jesus..! Alright, we'll wait for tomorrow so the absent kid can cast his vote. Now go home!  Alright children, as you know, we've been waiting for the absent kid's ballot to come in. Well, his mother was nice enough to bring him in from the hospital so that he could cast his vote. Ms. Harris?  Filmore. Oh, Jesus tap-dancing Christ. There's a box next to Filmore's name and a box next to Ike's! What's not to understand? Who's your famous aunt? Your aunt Rosie O'Donnell is coming here?  Oh no..! What the hell is that?   I'll try to fight it off! Oh. Oh, um... Pleasure to meet you, Miss Donnell. You're looking... well. Look, it's very simple. We took a vote and the vote tied, so now we gotta come up with a way--  Half the kids in the class didn't ''vote'' for your nephew, so what about them? You don't give a crap about them because they're not on ''your side''! People like you preach tolerance and open-mindedness all the time, but when it comes to Middle America, you think we're all evil and stupid country yokels who need your political enlightenment!  ...Oh, sorry I got a little off the subject there, kids. Oh no, children, I think I've just made this a whole lot worse. Okay, children, the lawyers for Ike's side have agreed with the lawyers on Filmore's side to hold another meeting regarding Form 22F. Do we all have that form?  Jesse Jackson?  We don't have any African-Americans in our class! Alright, so apparently what we're gonna do now is hand-count each person's ballot-- You... yuh, you what? Ohuh... Yes.  Yes! Let's fingerpaint! Hello, parents, and welcome to the 13th annual South Park Thanksgiving Pageant. And now, here it is. The touching story of Helen Keller, "The Miracle Worker."  And finally tonight, parents, we have the South Park Kindergarten class. Their play is titled, "Thanksgiving, Mon Ami." Alright, see you next year, parents.  It's called intervention, Eric. Yeah, except for me. I just wanted to see the look on your face when they told you.  But that's not the question. 1776. It's not that funny, you guys. Jesus. We'll march with you, Chef. How could any of you think that flag should stay the way it is?!  Stan?! How could you be so insensitive?!  Okay. Now, in order for us the debate to change the South Park flag, we will need to do a lot of research. Now, my plan is to divide up into three research teams. We will present our arguments based on things that w-  Nice of you to show up! We were just discussing how we should state our case.  What??  Cartman, we can't just attack Stan and Kyle's credibility. We need to present our side of the debate. The South Park flag! D'aaaaahhh! This might come in handy. It says here that recently a case was brought before the South Carolina Court about their flag, and they- If we could show a parallel between the South Carolina case- Cartman, why don't you just go home?! You aren't helping any! That's because you're stupid, and you're a racist! I can't believe it. All the pressure's on ''us''. I mean, this debate is going to actually af''fect'' the outcome of the vote. Oh man, we've got to come up with rebuttals to the history argument. Huh?  Hey, that's a pretty good point, Cartman. Not bad at all. I may make that our first argument.  Double-stuffed cookies are my favorite.  Hey, that's what ''I'' always do, too! Yeah. Jesus, I never thought I'd have anything in common with you, Cartman. Aha ha. Weird, um. Okay. Uh. Now, let's say that first we talk about the history of the flag.  No.  You go ahead.  Say it'll be like this forever. Oh, Cartman!  AAAAAAaaaah!   Aaaah!  Oh God, please don't let this be happening.  Thanks for coming over, Bebe. I have something to tell you. Bebe, I'm attracted to Cartman.  I know. Because I don't know what to do. I can't concentrate, and if I can't concentrate, then I can't win the debate tomorrow. The whole vote is dependent on me doing a good job- You mean, I should kiss him?   Oh God.  Mmmmmummmmeeemmeeemeeemmee...  Phew. I'm sure glad ''that's'' over with.   I can't believe how right Bebe was about feeling under pressure with somebody. As soon as it was over, all my feelings for you just vanished. I'm totally back to normal. See you later.  Hahaha.   Yeah!  You guys don't actually think this is going to work, do you? Doctor, doctor! Will our daughter be okay? Oh no! NO! My poor little Helen. She can't see or hear us, John. I know! How about, instead of a dog, Helen Keller has a pet turkey. Do you think we could make up a good Thanksgiving play in four days? Oh, no! She can't see hear, John. Watch. Helen! Oh no! Oh no!!!  There is nothing we can do for our poor daughter. We cannot reach her. Uhh, Ms. Choksondik, aren't manatees endangered? Well, Timmy. I just don't know what to do with you. You're getting very poor marks in school and the teachers are complaining that you aren't paying attention. Well, that does it! I'm suspending you, Timmy, until you can learn to respect your elders!  What?? Oh! Well, that certainly would explain it. Good. What can we do for him, doctor? Mr. Garrison, last week's charges of attempting to solicit sex from a minor wa-  Thursday's no good, we've got choir council. What about next Sunday? Oh, I can't do Monday. Yeah. How about Saturday at 11:30?  Apparently he's read the entire Bible, and now he's scaring the hell out of everyone. Don't listen to them, kids. You have to go to school. Oh, this new fourth-grade teacher is driving me nuts! Well, Miss... Choksondik, those children did fairly well in the third grade. Oh? Which one? I'm afraid that's impossible. Nobody's seen Mr. Garrison since the last school year ended.  Whattaya think? Too forward?  Waaah!  As we said before, that's impossible. And then he was accused of trying to solicit sex from a young boy. He finally snapped and had a nervous breakdown and... went up into the mountains to live in solitude. But he could be anywhere up high in those mountains. Mr. Garrison? You admit it? You admit it!  Well, congratulations! Oh. I'm sorry, we don't hire gay people.  Yeah, I swore that if I had to see it one more time, I'd put a bullet in my head.  But luckily I got really stoned before I came. Oh, oh, haha. Wow.  Oh, wow.   Ah, Ms. Choksondik, can we have a quick word with you? And so apparently there's been a little mixup. The ''manatees'' were meant to go to the Denver Shelter Aquarium and the ''frogs'' were meant to come here. Congratulations. How do you feel? Alright, this is a very simple test which should determine without a doubt whether or not Timmy has Attention Deficit Disorder. Egh. Now, Timmy, I'm going to read you a book called, "The Great Gatsby," by F. Scott Fitzgerald. At the end of the novel I'll ask you a few questions. Are you ready?  Okay now, Timmy. Can you tell me: In Chapter 7, what kind of car did Gatsby drive?  Well, that settles it! This young man definitely has Attention Deficit Disorder! Well, ADD is fairly common in kids today. I'm gonna prescribe some Ritalin, and we'll see how that goes for little Timmy. "After a while I went out and left the hospital, and walked back to the hotel in the rain."  It's Ritalin for all of you!  That's easily another twenty grand apiece!  Well, they've all been diagnosed with ADD. That's Attention Deficit- Huh? Hey now, don't tell us our business, Mr. Chef. Why, we- Mm- my God. What have we done??  We uh... have to convince them not to take it, but, ahah ih it'll be hard to get it away from them. Uh, what's the antidote for Ritalin?  Huh?? Yeah, I've got it. Me too. Yeah. It's gay.  Hooray. Dude, we suck! Hey, that's not the right attitude, Jonesy! The Battle of the Bands is tomorrow night!  Not a big deal! This year's winner gets to open for Phil Collins at Lalapalooblaza, and that's no big deal?! We've just gotta practice more. Hey, am I the leader of this band or not?! Huh, let's do it from the top!  Huh-I don't know, man.  Whoaaa! You a singer, man? Yeah! 1 2 3 4   Wooo!! Yes! I'm a rocker!   Yeah? Oh, yeah. You're opening for us as Lalapalazabla. Oh, thanks a lot. I appreciate that. Gotta run.   Huh? Nuh-nn, the name of the band is Timmy and the Lords of the Underworld.  Uh, thanks man. See ya.  Yeah. All of them chanting "Timmy, Timmy." The name of the band is Timmy AND the Lords of the Underworld, not just Timmy. And the Lords of the Underworld! It's always about you, isn't it?! I'm sick of it! Timmy gets all the applause! Timmy gets all the chicks! Well, you know what?! Forget you, man!  I'm goin' solo!   They booed Phil Collins off the stage. Everyone's chanting for Timmy and the Lords of the Underworld.  I don't expect anything. Timmy, I-gh... Well, I just wanted to say we had some pretty rockin' times, dude, and... maybe I let fame and Phil Collins go to my head...  What do you say, Timmy?  Dude, we ''never'' win the Battle of the Bands! It's no big deal. Dude, we've been practicing for eight years, Skyler.  What was that? Dude, that's hot!  We did it, dude!  Alright, let's rock this house! Hello Miami!  Another great show, man. There must have been a hundred thousand people out there. What's the matter, Skyler? Man, it sucks not being part of Lalapalabala.  Skyler, what are you doing here?!   Hey, you guys, you'd better stop fighting. Who is that? Skyler, Timmy is what made our band famous. Yeah.   Hn they want us back.  Wow. That is about the nicest Trapper Keeper ''I've'' ever seen.  Well that does it. I'm gonna have to report this.  Relax, Linda, everything's fine.  No, uh, it's lemon juice. No, it just really, really, really hurts!  Where are your parents?!  ...Okay, I'm scared now, too. That freaked me out. Get off me!  What the hell is gong on here?! Alright, kid! We demand to see an adult this instant! The mayor! Good! Finally! No parents in the entire town? What happened to them? No phones, either? How do you communicate? Alright, we've had just about enough here! That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen! I don't care what little games you kids wanna play, we just want outta here, alright?  I have the job interview of my life in Breckenridge! Just tell me how to get to a phone or a car! Look! If getting the stupid book will get me a cell phone, I don't care!  Well, I ''told'' you I can't deal with kids, Linda! That's why I don't want to have children! Oh, let's not go through this again, Linda. D-  it makes no sense. It's a boy.  They... killed him. Oh no!    Why are you doing this? Who? Look, ''I'' have the job interview of my life in less than-  -12 hours! I just need a phone, and he said he'd help me if I took your book so you couldn't... kill them anymore. I'll do anything to get to a phone! Ah-ah-ah-ah,let me get this straight: if I go get the fat kid's book on the other side of the white line, you'll show me where a cell phone is? No, uh, it's it's it's right out here. Come on.  Linda, I want you to just go back to the car and wait for me, alright? I'll go get that fat kid's book so I can use their phone. I know, but this will all be over soon. Alright, I got the book for you.  Now, can I please have the cell phone? Give him the book back. Enough of this! You kids are all in big trouble!  Stop right there! Nobody's killing anybody tonight! What?  Is that what happened to the adults here?! You lied to the police and said they molested you?! My God, they were your parents! The birth-givers! Your birth-givers.  He won't take care of you. Your parents... your... providers... will.  Ten days?? It's only been ten days since they left?? Yeah, I guess you're right. Maybe we ''should'' have some. Yeah. I got the job. You're looking at the new manager of Denny's in Breckenridge.  Well, what are you kids gonna do now? There is your prescription, Ms. McCormick. A hundred dollars' worth of Ritalin. We can only hope so. Next?  Next, please?  What do we have here- ah! The Ritalin! Oh, no no, your son may experience a small lack of energy, but that's all. Oh, and he might start seeing little pink Christina Aguilera monsters, but that's to be expected. Look at that. Ritalin stocks are up ten points. Can I help you? Eh wuh, what??  Well, if I had known... Phil Collins, uh, my God!  Yes, of course. I have some right here.  It's a compound called "Ritalout." Can I help you, young lady? Oh, you want some morning-after abortion pills. Well, they're right over there.  Uh, I'm sorry, young lady, but I can't sell that to you without permission from your parents.  Oh, well, alrighty then. Cash or charge? And he won't have Attention Deficit Disorder anymore? How much is all this gonna cost? Wow, what a great country. Everybody's poor, like us. Good job, Kenny.  Well, what do you think, Kenny? You'd have to leave your friends and your family behind. Okay, okay! Kenny, your dad and I are thinking about having another baby. Wouldn't you like to have another brother or sister?  Stop it! Oh, alright.  Oh, go ahead. We can make love afterwards.  What happened?! Well, Kenny, the doctor confirmed it. I'm pregnant! You're gonna have a little brother or sister. Yup, it's for sure! Don't be out too late, Kenny. We need to start movin' stuff out of your room.  Oh, well that's very sweet of you, Kenny. You made my favorite drink for me. But unfortunately, now that I'm pregnant, I can't drink. What's the matter?  Oh, it's all right.  Come on, Stuart, let's just get you to a bathroom. You can? What is it??  Bad baby, bad!  Kenny, what are you going to plunge? Aaaaaaah!   Kenny, GIVE IT UP!  Are you alright, Stuart? Our little angel, yes. What should we name him? Yes. Kenny's such a great name. My little Kenny, a brand-new Kenny. (''The new Kenny then mumbles'') Fifty-second. That's my boy!  We didn't, either. Make a sweater?  Kenny? Kenny, we're sorry. Where is he? Oh, hi, Sheila. Yes. I should have known. It all makes sense now. I could never get Stanley to pay attention when his grandfather told him stories about the '30s. That video had pretty colors. Me too. We were lucky to get tickets.  No, Stanley. Cirque du Cheville is French-Canadian. They get acrobats and singers from all over the world and then do very ''artistic'' things.. Dad, Stanley needs to see the arts! Come on, everybody, let's go.  Oh, look at the funny clown, Stanley. Ooo, these are the contorting quintuplets from Romania.  Yes. Too bad it was their last show, or I'd go see it again. Well, of course you can. Come in out of the snow.  There's some spare bedrooms upstairs, Mrs....? What should we do, Randy? I like these Romanians fine, but I hope that old woman isn't planning on staying here much longer. Poor dear must be tired. I don't know how to tell. ''You'' tell them.  Randy!  Well, for the time being I, I mean, of course they can stay. Randy, Randy, you'd better have look at this.  Well, I… think we… have to,… don't we?  We'll have to call the police and see what ''they'' want us to do.   Oh my God! I didn't know this was going to become such a big deal. Stanley, we have some bad news. The courts have decided the girls must go back to Romania. Oh, Randy, it's gone! It's all gone! You ruined my house!  Hello, sweetie.  Well, the kids at school made you a card, Kyle. Look.  Sheila, have you tried holistic natural medicines? They work wonders. I read all about in People. There's a brand-new shop in town that sells holistic medicines and all-natural foods. It's run by this fascinating woman named "Miss Information." Why don't we at least take Kyle down there and see what she has to say. Wow, that's amazing, Miss Information! Don't be a smartass, Stanley. Ooo, Native Americans. Now, they know how to heal the body spiritually.  Oh, that's great news!  Ooooo. Stanley, what did I say about being a smartass?! Ooh, a tampon made from Cherokee hair—now that sounds natural. Oh hi, Stanley. Look, I'm buying you some more all-natural toothpaste. That's right. You watch your mouth, Stanley! The Native Americans were raped of their land and resources by white people like us! Enough, Stanley! It's okay. We trust that you know what you're doing.  How dare you deceive us like that! Yeah, it looks like Western medicine really did the trick. Did you have fun at Eric's house today, Stanley? What did you do? Oh well, that sounds nice. Oh, he's over at Eric's house practicing for his boy band. Now, Randy, calm down. It's just a silly little dream. They're not gonna actually make it. It's a long story, Shelly. Let's just say your father... has a lot up his ass right now. Yeah.   What? We are not trying to persecute you kids, but you're supposed to be in school. Hi, Sheila. Oh, he's in the back. He set up a video camera so he can tape the performance. I... well... maybe.   Oh, Stanley, I wish we could take back all the years of abuse, but we can't. Isn't this a nice Christmas, Stanley? No commercialism and shopping, just a nice fire and family. Sharon, your son has Attention Deficit Disorder too? I know what you mean. Kyle gets so hyper, sometimes he runs around and screams like a little eight-year-old. Oh, I'm so excited. I've always wanted to see Cirque du Cheville. Oh, this is so exciting Oh, that was wonderful! Kyle, Stan and his mother came over to visit you. They say it's his kidneys. Kyle always has been a diabetic and lately his kidneys have just been shutting down. I don't know what to do, Sharon. They wanna have him go into surgery, but they're so dangerous. Really? In People? Oh, well, with a name like "Miss Information" she must know something. Okay. I'll get our coats.  Toxins? You hear that, Kyle? You don't need surgery after all.  Really? Oh no! Wow. Well, I am on natural medicines. If only I had known sooner. Wonderful! Everything's going to be fine, Stan. We're bringing Kyle in tomorrow to see the Native Americans personally.  Okay, here he is. But you're more in touch with the earth. Yes, of course, but we don't have a kidney donor! How are you feeling, boubbie?  Mr. Garrison, you're a Klan member?!  Why? What did you do, Kyle?! Oh noooo, that's just Catholics. Us Jews don't believe in hell. Well..., Kyle..., they could be wrong, too. Kyle! Us Jews don't believe in hell. It's not that, Kyle. It's just that Eric's mother needs to see you all right away.  Just really quick; she says it's very important. I sure hope this works. Hello, Sharon. Where's your husband? Oh, so did Gerald.  This is "The Miracle Worker"? No, Kyle. Kyle, you're not old enough, and those concerts are dangerous and vile. Alright. Fine, Kyle, you can ''go'' to the Raging Pussies concert if you clean out the garage, shovel the driveway and bring democracy to Cuba! The whole thing. No you can't! We know, Kyle, but we just don't want you going to their concert. Kyle! Oh my God, this isn't happening. I would never touch my children like that. Ugh, please, just listen to me!  What about my children? Who will take care of them? Their grandmother's been dead for three years.  mother never raped you! Tell them! It's my fault. Say it! Tell them right now!! Oh, Gerald, I haven't seen you for so long! Oh, it's awful! Just awful. Kids!   It won't happen again.   It's getting late, boys. Why don't you come on up to bed. Alright, bubbe.  Oh, and boys? Happy Chanukah. Look alive, lettin' it feel (so light). Lettin' it feel so light. Boooo!  You suck!  Alright, that was "Sisters of Mercy Hold No Pain Against the Dark Lord," with their song, "Silk Blood On The Footsteps Of My Mind (Revisited)" And now it's time for our final band. Give it up for "Timmy and the Lords of the Underworld!"  Dude, this is a no-brainer. This year's Battle of the Bands winner and the band that gets to open for Phil Collins at Lalapalablala is... TIMMY! We got the best response. We'll be opening for Phil Collins for sure. Thank God!  Oo-yee-hee-yeh-hah! All-natural cell phones!  Oh, yeah. We can't do Sunday. Saturday is perfect for me. Mm hmm. Oh, march? What are we marching for? …Oh.  See you later. No doubt about it... Do it again! Woohoo! Oh yeah. Right in the balls, man. Right square in the balls. Boring. You guys are terrible! How could you laugh at that poor kid?! They're ridiculing that singer!   Ooo.  I could do Tuesday. Mm hmm. That sounds good. Oohh, I gotta go. Oooooooooh! Hey kid! I'll give you 20 bucks to eat a really old piece of bacon! I've gotta go. <poem><i>Lords of the Underworld.</i></poem> <poem><i>Darkness fills my heart with pain.</i></poem> <poem><i>The Lords of the Underworld.</i></poem> <poem><i>Darkness fills my heart with pain. </i></poem> Alright! <poem><i>And the Lords of the Underworld.</i></poem> Boys! You shouldn't laugh at him! He's ''handicapped!'' How would ''you'' like to be handicapped?! Do you think that would be funny?! You're making him feel bad! Oh, you people make me sick!   Cartman, I want youuu! Nothing. Why? I don't know, uh. I guess nothing. Oh, huhuh.  Eh, heheheheheheh. Oh, huhuh.  What's happening?? ...Because now, every time I look at you  I have to move on. Oh, sweetie, I have no idea where we are. There ''has'' to be a town around here somewhere. Hey, it was your idea to take the backroads.  What's the matter with it? Oh, look! There's a town up ahead.  Smiley Town? That's a strange name. Hello? Is anybody here?  Yes. Why not?! Ew, I almost stepped in it.  Wooo!  Wooo!!  Awww. '''''Aaggghh!''''' Awww.  Oh, wow! Tonight, we analyze the new rock sensation, Timmeo , the band prepares for its biggest gig, Lolapalooblaza, where they will open for Phil Collins. But Phil Collins is not happy.  Well, I thinks it's a horrible tragedy, idn't it? I mean, people aren't gonna see Timmy for his musical skills. They're laughin' at 'im, and I think you shouldn't laugh at people with disabilities! Society has to learn how to be more compassionate! This is gonna stop if I have to stop it myself!  Well, I think the sad question is, "Where are the parents in all this?" I mean, that kid's parents are lettin' him be exploited, and they don't even seem to care.  Well, I mean, why are you lettin' 'em do this to your son? Don't you see that everyone's just laughin' at him? Excuse me, Skyler Morse? Nice to meet you. I'm Phil Collins. I just wanted to tell you that, well, I think that you're a great guitar player and song writer. It's too bad those other guys are holdin' you back. Well, I mean, it's obvious all the talent and artistic vision in the band comes from you. Strange, how everyone focuses n Timmy, idn't it? I mean, even the name of the band is "Timmy," Look, I used to be in a band, too. Genesis. And all those bastards did was hold me back and hold me back. But then, finally, I went solo. And that's when I started writing really ''great'' songs. But look, if you happen to be on the sidelines, you know, bein' more of a cheerleader than a player, well, then I guess you should stay on as Timmy's shadow. That should just about put an end to all this Timmy nonsense.  <poem><i><br />Last night I went, "O!"<br />Bubudio<br />Last night I went "Bubudio"</i></poem> <poem><i>Last night I went, "O!" Bububudio. </i></poem> I know. I'd like to sing the complex and amazing song that won me the Oscar, a song entitled, <poem><i>"You'll Be In... Me."  So deep inside, I can feel you pushing against my heart.</i></poem>   Shut your filthy holes, you little bastards! You just wanna laugh at him.  Awwww!  Hah haha.  Hello. This is Romanian father. I am desperate to have my girls returned to me in Romania. How I've missed them all. Little Nahlal. Nadia, my sweet Barshta Baltania, eh anyway, my heart is aching for their return. I, I know the American government will do what's right.  We demand you release these men at once! We are NAMBLA, the North American Man Boy Love Association, and we heard about these political prisoners you're keeping? Loving young boys has been around since the time of the Romans, pal! There's nothing wrong with it! We are an organization dedicated to showing that sex between a man and a young boy can be a beautiful thing! Hate mongerer! Hate mongerer! All these men wanted was to love a young boy!  There is nothing wrong with love! You haven't heard the last of us, officer! Together we are strong.   Fellow members of NAMBLA. As you know, hn hn, we continue to be discriminated against. Recently, the FBI has started to arrest men, who are doing nothing more than trying to start a sexual relationship with a young boy. Hu-uh?! Nothin'. Just... shopping. What's happening here? Hm... Well, let's just walk away then.  Aaawwwwwww!  Where are we?  I am not a homeless person. I am a new fourth-grade student. Yes! My name is Bill. Bill Cosby. Kelly, please. Don't do this. I'm sorry. I don't know!   And me. How are we not to cry. Our hearts have been broken, our lives ruined, and now we are set to die!  Panda bears make me sad. They're almost extinct.  My father died in a stamp-collecting accident.  I haven't seen a road marker for miles. What was the last highway we were on? Maybe you're reading the map wrong. What the?  Oh no. No, no, no, no.  I have no idea. Oh, we're gonna have to find some help quick. We're not gonna make it more than a couple of miles. Well, it'll have to do. It's probably the only town for a hundred miles.  ...Yes, we need a mechanic to look at our car. ...It's... just you here? Oh, good. Look we're in a bit of a spot here! I've got a very important job interview tomorrow morning in Breckenridge, so I have to get my car fixed fast! Is there another garage in town? How about a ''phone''? Can we just use the ''phone''? Fine! Can you take us there? Yes. Well, can you help us find the phone, please? Alright, let's just... go, Linda. I don't have time for Spaceman Spiff's little games. What? Look, there's an elementary school  Linda, it's a remote-controlled car.   See a movie?  You know, it's just that a lot of people don't really believe in the whole Jesus thing anymore, you know? So what's to celebrate? Oh, that's Christmas for ya. Hello, Chef. Very well, thank you. Yayy! Huh? Rown!   Rowr.  Rowr.  Why am I still doing this? I've got to be the oldest person in this network by at least 40 years. Well, it's only two weeks until Lalapalalababa, and the headlining band has changed. Now headlining the event is Timmy , the new hit sensation out of Colorado. This news came as a shock to the performer that ''was'' going to headline Lalapalabala, Phil Collins.  Phil Collins warns that a novelty band that makes fun of the handicapped should ''not'' be allowed to play Lalapalablalala, and vows to do everything in his power to stop it. Phil Collins, by the way, divorced his wife via fax and then married a 27-year-old. I'm Kurt Loder, and that's the news. Richarrrrd! 'Oodleahah. Helennnn! Thank you, Baltimore! Good night! Terrance, what brand of pants am I wearing? How do you like that, Terrance? Hey, Terrance, I think I have to fart.  Say Terrance, this body appears to have been moved since the murder. Look at the forensic evidence around the torso. Look closer.  Hunh-nh. Waitwait. Hunh.  Af!  Wait. Before you do, pull my thumb. I don't see anything. I still don't see anything, Phillip. AAHahahahahahaaa! Uh, but our kids have Attention Deficit Disorder, Chef. They can't pay attention in school without it. Wasn't that great, son? Okay, is everyone ready to go? You didn't know ''that'' was gonna happen, did you, Stanley?  You're from Cirque du Cheville.  Well… Ew, Dad! Not in front of Stanley! Heh, it's 11 o'clock and she's still sleeping. Huh? Alright, we've gotta figure out what to do. I'm gonna go wake her up.   No, Dad. No, Dad, she's dead! It looks like she had a heart attack.  Ew! Uh, girls, we… have some bad news. Um...  Well, Stan, it's not really our-  Uh-oh. I don't know.  That'll teach us for taking an old lady and her granddaughters out of the cold.  I'm sorry, boys, but Janet Reno is having them taken away on Easter Sunday. We... don't have a choice. Sorry, girls.  Oh, shi-  Oh, uuhh, look, Chef, you know I'm-m not a racist, but uh, I just don't really feel strongly one way or another about the flag.  Stanley, you are gonna have no part in that boy band.  would you do that too? '''''You are not gonna be in a boy band, Stanley! AND THAT IS FINAL!'''''  Where is Stan? '''''What?! I specifically told him not to do that!''''' And what if they do make it, Sharon? What if they ''do'' make it? Are ''you'' gonna be the one to tell 'im?!   Stanley, what the hell are you doing? You get in the truck right now!   Stanley, it's just that there's better things you could be doing on a Saturday than singing and dancing. You could be watching TV or, laying in bed. Well, there's plenty of other interesting you can do. Have you ever tried marijuana? Well, maybe it's time. Because I said so! Let 'em be pissed off, then! '''''No!!'''''   ...I was... I was 18 when my high-school men's choir performed at the grand opening of a sporting-goods store in Denver.  And just like that I left everything. I dropped out of high school... ...I said good-bye to my girlfriend... ...And I left my family. And suddenly there I was, thrown into a group with four other young men who I didn't even know.  The songs were terrible. But believe it or not, the country ate them up. The next thing I knew, we were the biggest thing in the world.   And then one day, just as quick as it started... They said that after all the money we had made we were in debt to the studio, so they towed my car... ...the women all left... ...and they took back my house. The only thing I could do was come back to Colorado, and face everyone that I had abandoned.  And so you see, Stanley, I... do know what I'm talking about. I didn't ''want'' you to know. Because now I'm a joke. Ever since then, I've wished ''every single day'' that I could go back to that moment when I was offered the job and say, "No!" Because all the fame and the money, the women... All it did was build me up, so that I could be knocked down harder than anybody in the world.  Huh? Yeah?  Stan, it was wrong of me to try and stop you from joining a boy band without explaining why. I've made some mistakes in my life, and now... I have to let you make your own mistakes. You know, in a way, I think I was even jealous of you being in a boy band. Isn't that stupid? Well, come on. I'll drive you down to the mall. Yeah. I wanna see what you guys can do. And then we'll go buy you a small toy so that you can forget all about this. Yeah. I guess I still got it in me a little.  Well, ''that'' was quite an uplifting sermon. Oh, now look at that. They're scared to death. Oh, what the hell are they doing now?! Ey, Gerald, maybe after the show we can make copies of each other's tape so we have both. Uh, excuse me, but my wife and I honestly never touched our child. ''That'' is the spirit of Christmas. Commercialism. Because it's what makes our country work! Hello, I'm Dr. Richard Shay, here to tell you about my exciting new drug-free treatment for children with Attention Deficit Disorder.  This treatment is fast and effective and doesn't use harmful drugs. Watch closely as I apply treatment to the first child. Sit down and study!  Sit down and study! Stop crying and do your schoolwork!   Ah! I want Ike to be president!  Who are you?!  Is that so, you smelly little bastard?!  In here. I'm not going in there, you stupid puddle of a homeless man urine! Me neither. Yes. Yes. ...Come here, come here. Booooo!! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Awww! Awgh!  Hooray! Four, three, two, one! OOOOHHHHHH! Ladies and gentlemen, without further ado, it is my pleasure to introduce the reunion tour of Timmehuh!  Why the hell do you wanna take these boys to see that fufu French theater crap? You're gonna turn them into poofders! Well, he doesn't need to see a bunch of frogs prance around in tights and make-up wrappin' their peckers around each other's faces!  Close your eyes and cover your ears, Billy! Remember, you're a man. Aha, I knew it. They turned you into poofders. No, Billy! You're gonna stay here and watch more MacGyver. We've gotta get all the Frenchy-poo fag-nasties out of ya.  Who the hell would be ringin' the doorbell at this time of night? That Grandma is not a bad piece of ass. Well, it's good for 'im.  Got everything you need there, do ya? They're quite agile little things, aren't they? Y'don't say.  You… ...remember any of that stuff, do ya?  Ah.  Oh-oooh-oooh!  You're damn right she's tired. Oh, nothin'. She's just gonna have a little trouble walkin' today is all. .  Well, all tuckered, is she? Ha ha ha ha. A little cottony in the crotch? Hr hr hr hr. What?!  Oh, dear Jesus! No wonder she didn't say good-night.  Aw, go ahead and shoot me! I dare ya! Pull the trigger, you little pussy! I wanna die.  Awwwgh.  Hurry up, girls. We must bundle up against the cold. Very good, my girls. I only wish it weren't your last show. I love this country so very much.  Yes, yes, of course. Just give me vone second to finish getting them ready.  Your mother did not want you to grow up in Romania. This is our only chance.  Okay girls, the Cam Ay Alta.  Very good, Glacas. We are very sorry to disturb you. My granddaughters are cold and tired. Is there any possibility we could pay you for a place to sleep? Yes. We- missed our train. If we could shelter here; it would only be for one night. Oh, thank you so much.  Vladchick.  Yes. You're avefully soo kind to my little granddaughters. Yes, as I was back in my day. I was a contortionist, too. Yes. Did we do good final show, Grandmama? You have your own?  Mmm. Mrs. Vladchick, it is time. It is time to return to Romania. Nid kelmin da bushka. Nid kelmin da bushka ayn zolt!  Dash fam da bushka!   There's nowhere to go, Mrs. Vladchick. Pull over!   This could kill our tourism.  Mrs. Janet Reno, you must understand, the father has right to his children. Our home is Romania. We love it there. If daughters will not return on their own, you must ''force'' them to return Protest?  Alright, it is time for us to return to Romania. Vhy are we going out the window, Grandmama? Nid kelmin da lushka velt M-Mrs. Vladchick?  They're trying to defect!  ''Oiga. Hay algo pegado bajo el autobus. ["Listen. There's something stuck under the bus."]'' ''Pienso que sí. ["I think so." Kenny stands up]'' ''¿Qué?'' ''¿Qué?'' Where to, Mack? Did we do good, Grandmama? Hello, and welcome to: "Singing like Bocelli for Dummies." Lesson 1: ''Yaaayayeha!'' Lesson 2: ''Hehyayaya hehyayaya!'' Good: And now we'll do the entire piece, "Con te partirò"  And now lesson 4: the complete works of Mozart. Let's begin.  where a young blond-haired boy named Pip was on his way to see his parents. Well, the very next day, Pip went to Old Ms. Havisham's house to inquire about the job.  and it was there that he met the girl of his dreams.  That night, Pip spent all his sleeping hours unable to get Estella's beautiful face out of his mind. Day after day Pip visited Estella. Sometimes they would play, sometimes they would talk. But every single day Pip's love for Estella grew. Well, what a spot poor Pip was in. He was hired to be the friend of the very harsh and beautiful Estella. And although she treated him like dirt, or perhaps ''because'' she treated him like dirt, Pip found himself more in love with the little girl each and every day.  But, isn't it sad? Because Pip knew that someone as sophisticated and as wealthy as Estella could ''never'' love ''him'', for he was just a simple blacksmith's apprentice. And so Pip spent the next several months learning how to be a gentleman. He was schooled in several languages. He was taught fencing and marksmanship, and he was shown how to dance and eat box. And after it all, after WEEKS and weeks of intense schooling, Pip was finally a full-fledged gentleman. Proud of himself, Pip decided to pay Ms. Havisham a visit, to thank her for her generosity, and to see if he was indeed, now, good enough for Estella. Yes. Our young Pip had come a long way. From the apprentice of a blacksmith to a fine young gentleman of great expectations. And now he was to finally see his beloved Estella again at a Grand Ball held by the King of England, Tony Blair. It was here that Pip would finally and formally ask Estella to be his girlfriend. And all would be right with the world. And now we come to the final act of the Dickens classic tale, in which the stage is set for an epic showdown. Ms. Havisham's robot monkeys prove a formidable foe, but Pip is not about to let Estella's soul be forever consumed by the Genesis device. And now the thrilling conclusion of Great Expectations! And they all lived happily ever after. Except for Pocket, who died of hepatitis B.  Until next time, I'm a British person. Good night. Hello. Okay. What are we going to do now?  But we haven't seen papa for more than five years. What are you doing, Nadia? All of you are acting like idiots! None of you care about us. You only care about yourselves! The only place we can go. We're going on ''Oprah'' and then a book tour.  Hello. Ve are twins, except there are five of us instead of two. No no, Natalia is just playing mirror buddies with Nadia. Count me in. Grandmama is dead? Maybe. Oh, look. An Easter egg. Look at you, Father. You walked out on us five years ago , and now you act like you miss us sooo much! You are a liar and a fake! Hi. Sounds good.  And ''you'' Romanian leaders , you don't care about us! All you care about is making America look stupid! And ''you'' protesters! Don't you have anything better to do?! Get a life! And you boys are the worst of all! You know ''nothing'' about Romania, and yet you assume America is ''so much'' better! Maybe Romania isn't as nice as America, but it is ''our home!'' We are Romanian! All you care about is your ''own stupid circus! [at this point, a limousine pulls up behind them. It's from the Oprah show. The driver opens the back door and the girls head for the back seat]'' Hello. …Oh, and me.  Hello. I'm calling the only person in the vorld who can help us.  No, don't be ridiculous. Okay.  What? Yes. You can all kiss our little white Romanian asses!  All right! Ow!  Whoa! <poem><i>We wish you a Merry Christmas</i></poem>  AAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!! Tom, I'm standing at the home in South Park where five precious little girls have been rescued from Romania. Their mother passes away some months ago, and then their grandmother died trying to bring them here. But all is well now, and people are coming from all over the country to view the little tykes. , you can feed them fishsticks. Tom, it looks like these cute little girls have made it out of that armpit of a country they call Romania. Yes, luckily for them, these quintuplets no longer have to live in Romania, the asshole of the world.  Back to you, Tom. Tom, it is now Easter morning, and as the U.S. government promised, they are here to take the girls back to their father in Romania. Rumor has it that Janet Reno herself will be extraditing the quintuplets.   Tom, I'm standing out front of the South Park Mayor's Office, where both sides of this debate have gathered. Earlier, the South Park townspeople voiced ''their'' opinion. Well, one things for sure, tensions are high and pressure is mounting on the South Park Mayor to do something.  What's this? Uh, Tom, it looks as if the KKK have shown up to express their opinion. Should the Klan be allowed to rally on the steps of the Capitol? Here's what some people think. On Friday, South Park Elementary will present its debate, and after the debate, there will finally be a vote. Preliminary polls show three in favor of changing the flag, three against changing the flag, and 4382 undecided. Z So the pressure in on those South Park kids! Once again, this does mark the end of Communism in Cuba. Cuban dictator Fidel Castro claims he was finally convinced by a young boy's letter.  This is not good. It makes our country look poor and stupid. You know what to do.   Well, he's got potential. Depends on how good he wants to be. Well, if you wanna be a ''real'' singer, you need to go to a conservatory in Europe. There's no other alternative. Well, then, I'm afraid your son will always be a hack. Well, what do you think? Can you help him become a better singer? We can't afford that. Well, Kenny, if it means that much to you, maybe we can bus it to Europe and… you can sing on the way to make money. ...until the U.S. government receives this video, which was sent from Romania just hours ago.  It's been over three hours since the police first showed up on the scene of a handicapped boy's wheelchair set with explosives. The child can't stop or get off the chair without risking explosion, and so the SWAT team will now attempt to disarm the device.  Nadia!  Baltania! Hello. Your Excellency?  This is Sister Anne, the Bleeding Eyes of Jesus, calling from the United States? Yeah. Woo hoohoohoo. Yeah.   Yes, but the girls seem to wanna stay here. Why don't you ''all'' stay here in America, and this whole thing can go away. Gentlemen, this has to be handled very delicately. You don't understand Americans' power to protest. Look, people have it so good in America that they get bored very easily. And when people get bored they start protesting things. But I want to assure you, and the Romanian people, that we are going to do everything in our power to make this as confusing as possible.  Right. "Hello, girls. I'm the Easter bunny." Ready. Code blue!    Hand over the children! Happy Easter. Hand over the children!! Down! Down!  Alright. We just need to get a few more pictures of the girls reunited with their father so everyone knows they're happy.   What is that? God-damnit!   Where are you going, girls? Okay.  Heh! Ah, yes, uwuh we love it there. Oh. Let the quints stay! Romania is gay! Let the quints stay! Romania is gay! Romania sucks! Romania sucks! Boooo! Fur is murder! Fur is murder!  Oh, what are we protesting here? Oh, let's see  Here we go. Romania sucks! We love you, son, but we only love you in a platonic way from now on.  Romania sucks!  You have until Easter Sunday to comply. Nooo! Riot! Riot!  Let the quints stay!  What?!  Hup!  Alright, Ms. Reno, let's go over the plan. We'll drop you on the northwest corner of the backyard. You hop into the back of the house and find the quintuplets. When you see them, you say… Good. And then hand them the Easter eggs filled with tear gas. Are you ready? Code blue!  You can't see them, boys. They're happily reunited with their father. Aaa-a-a-aaa-ah. I was a practicing Jehovah's Witness. Lad, we would like very much to have you here at the Romanian Music School. Don't worry, Ms. McCormick, Romania is very poor country. Apartment is cheap. Food is cheap, ''Everything'' is cheap because we are so God-damned poor. Oh, your son is so talented, Ms. McCormick. The people of Romania love him. Mrs. McCormick, we would love for you and your son to stay here in Romania, with us. Will you consider it? Alright! Yes, your two hundred American dollars will last ''months'' here. We… could use the debate as an excuse to hold a vote on the issue.  In South Park. That's it. Let's move, move move move, move!  Give us the kids, now! Now! Down on the floor. Get down on the God-damned floor!   Alright, people, the father wants his son returned to him! Hand him over to us! Find them! Shut up, Romanians! All right, let's go. Move move move move!  Freeze, asshole! Don't push me, man! Gaahhh!   Hand over the boy, now! I mean it, lady, you've got about-!  Whoops. Gun! Gun!  Pepper spray! Pepper spray!  Go ahead! In the van!  Hmm. Yeaahh. I don't know. I usually like to stop protesting by 5:30. Yeah, ah, do we get overtime for this? Alright!  Yeah! Down with Japan!  Come on, girls. Smile.  Ah, hello? This is Kenny's dad, back in America. I miss my son very much. I would like to see him returned to me so that the U.S. government will buy me a new car and-  Man.  Come on, let's go try to get you pregnant again. Huh? Uh, I'll play catch with your later, son. Aw, alright. Well alright, here comes a pop fly. See if you can catch it!  Aw, he smacked me in the balls!  And he fixed my shattered left testicle, too! Well, ''I'' can still drink.  Ogh, that hits the spot. Makes me forget all about my shattered balls.  Who-o-oa. Oh, God, I'm gonna crap my pants!  Oohhh, God!  Are you sure you should be going on this thing? What did he say?  ...John Denver Experience. Oh, God, my nose! I think I broke my nose! Oh, I'm not gonna make it! I'm gonna be sick!  Oh my God, it killed Kenny! Kenny, what the hell are you doing?!  Kenny??   What the-? No, wait, no, WAH, NO, WAAAAAH!   Coo, cootchy-coo, coohoohoohoo, cootchy-coo. Oh, he's so beautiful. I know it's been hard on both of us losing poor Kenny. But this new baby kind of reminds me of him.  Well, seeing as though Kenny passed away, maybe we should name him ah,... Kenny. God, this must be the fiftieth time this has happened.  It's the protesters. They're back. Come on, come on, come on. Let's move. Move! Come oonn, come oonn.  This is government property! Let Kenny stay! Let Kenny stay! Let Kenny stay!  Boooo!  Hello, I'm Bill Kurtis. Many believe that the U.S. Government... covered it up. I'm Bill Kurtis. I'm Bill Kurtis. Yeah. You're -Eric?  I brought you some candy.  And some books on Kama Sutra. Yahahahah like having your back rubbed?  Huh?  Do you like having your back rubbed? Okay.  Hold it right there, scumbag!  Alright, scumbag, we got you! Nice try, buddy! We monitored your little online chat—now, you're coming with us!  Hey, we didn't try that room!  You can't eat, Kenny. We have to save food for the baby. Kenny, you have to change the baby's diapers! The baby. The baby!! Your mom and I are going out for a few weeks, Kenny. Take care of the baby. You have to share your room with the baby! The baby!  Hi there. Well, the FBI said I have to hold you here, so that's what I'm gonna do, Mr. Complainy Pants. Who are you? Political prisoners? No, these are child molesters.  Uuuh, I don't know who you are, but these men aren't going anywhere until I hear from the FBI. Okay people , I think you'd better move along before I arrest more of you!  Wow, they've got activists for everything these days. Well, Chef, it's freedom of speech. We don't like it, but we can't arrest them for talking.  Yeah, uh-huh. Hate mongerer! Hate mongerer! I've done it, Kevin. I've successfully spliced this chipmunk with a piece of provolone cheese.  Why, it's little Eric Cartman. Well of course, come in.  Oh, Eric, I'm afraid it's not that simple. Genetic engineering has not yet evolved to the state where I can just make people. Oh. Well, I happen to be a member of an organization that can help you. It's called, NAMBLA. Yes. I have been a member for several years. I'm sure they'd let you join. You l-look about right. Sure! Awwww.  Yeah. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! And now that all ethnic groups, homosexuals and women's are protected under civil-rights laws,  we want the same! What we need is proof that young boys want to be members of NAMBLA. That they ''want'' love from us. We need a poster child, to show the world that it is a beautiful and wonderful thing and a-  Can we... help you? You... do?  Oho, thank you. Thank you, Jesus.  Uh hey, Eric, we have a surprise for you. We want to have a big dinner and dance honoring you as our new poster child. Yes, and we you to um... invite all your young male friends.  Great, hnn. You go invite your little friends, and we'll get the hotel ready. Yeh-hehah-hah. Just a few more pictures, Eric. You make a perfect poster child.  It was-  -fun.  -fun.  Folks, please keep your hands and arms inside the John Denver Experience at all times. There's no sense in trying to unloop at the latch at any time during the ride at the John Denver Experience. Have fun. You're doing fine, Ms. McCormick.  I can see its head! Push, now. Push hard!   Alright, send him in.  Oh, Stanley. How can I help you? He is really, really sick, Stanley. I was seeing him last week when he first got ill, but unfortunately his mother has decided to put all her trust into holistic medicine. Alright, Stanley, I'm going to be very honest with you. Your little friend Kyle needs a kidney transplant. Or it is very possible that... he will die. I know this is a lot to lay on someone your age, but... the rest of the town is so gung-ho in New Age medicine that I have nowhere else to turn. That's very brave, Stan, but I've already checked my records, and you and Kyle aren't a match for kidneys. In fact,  there's only one person in South Park with the same blood type as Kyle. Why, hello there, Eric.  Oh, I see.  Are you sure that now that it's already out, you don't wanna just let your friend Kyle have it? Well, alright then. We'll get you prepped for surgery.  Yes, but it was all a trick to get you to come in and sign this release. We believe that you might have a problem. Yes, fat camp. He's dead. The pressure must have killed him.  Fellow NAMBLA members, it is great to see you all here. It seems like we have finally found a city that won't oppress us. First and foremost, I wanna recognize Eric Cartman, for putting us in touch with all of you pretty, young boys. Now, I know that many of us have already found partners in this fahine city, and I'd like to take a minute to hear some testimonials from members.  Ho, goodness! What a gift from God! Aha ha, we'll... "get" ...to it very soon, I assure you. But first, I'd just like to hear from a couple of you on your progress. Uh yes, Patrick. Wonderful, heh hn. And how about you, Mr. Harris? Wuhell, members, I know we're all eager to get acquainted with our new partners and, so why don't we turn down the lights and start to dance!   Everyone come up and grab your room keys and we'll head upstairs, hm hm. It's clear. The cops are gone. Where's the boys?!  Maybe the boys are in here. Oh bo-oys?   Rights? Does anybody know their rights? You see, I've learned something today.  We are human. Most of us didn't even choose to be attracted to young boys. We were born that way. We can't help the way we are, and if you all can't understand that, well, then, I guess you'll just have to put us away.  Oh, yeah.  Ho hohohoho Let's say that if they change the flag, we'll burn down the Capitol! ''Woo''hoohoohoohoo.  Let's say that if they change the flag, we'll never leave this town! Uh I, I found a little eight-year-old named Buttehers. He's a beautiful , bright, little boy. And his skin is as soft as fresh linen.   Well, I want to announce that I may have found the dream boy of the decade. He's sexy, sassy, and full of spunk. His name is Timmy. Alright, I want those perverted bastards all taken in. Got it?  Hold it right there! Alright, sickos. Where are the children?!  This... is... NAMBLA, right? The North American Man/Boy Love Association? You know of them? Let's get those perverts!  Alright, you're under arrest! Damnit!  We've been after you for a long time, buddy! Do you know your rights? Alright, that's enough. You're all going to be put away for a long time.  Got it!  What's going on?  What children? Yes.  Don't tell me that that other NAMBLA is actually in South Park?! Thank you. Now, let's go get those other NAMBLA bastards before they hurt any of South Park's children! Alright, Marlon Brandos, they've got to be here somewhere. Let's try this room.  I think the boys went in here.  No! You've got the wrong NAMBLA again! Freeze! Don't nobody move! Aw, crap! We got the wrong NAMBLA. Wow. You guys really ''do'' look a lot like Marlon Brando. Know of them? We've been fighting with them for years over the rights to nambla.com! Yeah, those perverted bastards! And let's kick their asses for stealin' our domain name! All right. Alright. Sacrebleu!  Zis time, I will not drop zeh food.  Allo!   Waaah!  Aaah!  Okay, let's roll.   Dr. Flores, dial 18-  Mr. Marsh is here to see you.  Good morning, children. Mr. Garrison is away today. I am your substitute teacher, Mr. Wyland.  Now, I understand that some students in this class like to mess with substitute teachers.  Eric Cartman? Alright, and how about Stan Marsh? Okay, and where iiiiss… Kenny McCormick? Alright. Look, why don't we skip roll call? Here's what we're gonna do today.  I've been told that one of your classmates has been ill for several days — Kyle Broflovski? Well, I've been told that in Mr. Garrison's absence, our activity for the day is to make a get-well card for Kyle. So I got this large piece of poster board, and we're all gonna come up and use glitter.and glue to decorate it. Kenny, you come and decorate the get-well card, too. I don't care! Get down here and do it! Okay, children, in Mr. Garrison's absence, I would like to turn the class's attention to current issues. Some people think the South Park flag should be changed, while others believe that changing the flag is wrong. I think this is a perfect subject for your debate club. I see that you've already had a lot of interesting debates this year.  Pro-Choice vs. Cartman, Pro-Gun Control vs. Cartman, a-and People Against the Clubbing of Baby Seals vs. Cartman. And apparently, the winner of ''all'' your debates so far has been... Cartman. Alright, children, well, unlike Mr. Garrison, ''I'' want you all to go out and ''re''search this debate be''fore'' we pick teams. Tomorrow, you'll need to choose which side of this poignant debate you are on.  Well I've counted up all your secret ballots, children, and it look like about half of you think the flag should stay, and half think the flag should be changed. Save it for the debate, Wendy. Now I'm going to assign the debate leaders. Who wants to lead the "Flag Should Stay The Way It Is" team? Alright. Stan and Kyle,  Alright, children. Do your homework, and let's get ready for a great debate! Well I certainly would like to thank all the parents for their support of our debate club.  Okay, and Kyle and Stan's team, your main point?  What? Awww.  Mr. Garrison, after very careful review the school board believes that you should take a... hiatus from teaching. Indefinitely. Did you know that not one of your students knew who Sam Adams was? ...Frankly, Mr. Garrison, it isn't even your educational record that we're most concerned about.  It's your somewhat substantial police record. We're sorry, Mr. Garrison, we have no choice. Mr. Garrison, most teachers do not carry a gun! Frankly, your conduct has been somewhat disconcerting.  All we're saying is, perhaps you should take a little hiatus from teaching until this little  "child molestation" thing dies down a bit. You see, the reason our body is stale is because of toxins. All the horrible food we eat—the sodas and meats are filled with toxins, and the only way for us to get better is to flush those toxins out of our system. Western medicine is so quick to cut and carve up, but all your son needs is a toxin-flushing diet of lemon juice and cayenne pepper. What? Mrs. Broflovski, I would like to give your son herbs that focus on the kidney. I have these excellent herbs from local Native Americans.  Good morning, everyone. Huuuuuuuuuh  Oh, I don't agree. He seems much better. Yes, his chi is flowing much nicer than yesterday, and his aura is lighter. Nono, that's good. Those are the toxins flushing out of the system. Now, don't be fooled. As Kyle's body sheds itself more and more of all the toxins he will appear to be getting worse, but actually, he is getting better! Oh, look everyone. These are our two resident Native Americans. Chief Running Pinto, and Carlos Ramirez.  Native Americans are more in tune with the earth than we are.  Mrs. Broflovski's son is a little sick. Perhaps she could bring him in tomorrow and you could give him some spiritual healing.  Good-bye, Native Americans. The spirit of Maya is with you. Well, of course the doctor told you that, because he wants to make money. Holistic medicine is about NATURE.   Yes. He really needs his toxins flushed again. Uh, toxins ''are'' your enemy.  Oh my, he looks terrible. Yes, poor little dear.   I'd like to buy some more stuff.  Huh, but then again, it ''is'' part of our history. Hey, wait a minute, I shouldn't be here. I was a totally strict and devout Protestant! I thought we went to heaven! I'll pay him 50 bucks to eat someone else's vomit. Stupid. Come in. Come here, guys. Well, I guess the flag is part of history, …but I can see how it is racist. Well, who was right? Who gets into heaven? Yeah! My God, they're right! Do you have any new holistic items for sale?  I think it is history. I think it is racist. Yeah! Go for it! Oohh, oh yeah. Aah...  Here, uh, this is a- uhh, dream...catcher. Oh yeah, the earth is great.  uh'hm, ho ho hm. Oh yah. You too and junk.  Oh, here, try this, man. Ah, this is allll-naturalll ball juice.  No, man, that kid needs a doctor! And besides, we're not actually Native Americans. I mean, I'm- I'm more like a- a Mexican. Yeah. A Mexican. Yeah. She said nobody would buy anything from Mexicans.  Funny. Oh, a dreamcatcher. I'll buy one.  Kill her!   Yeah. And these here are Cherokee hair tampons. They're, like, tampons made with all-natural hair from the Cherokee people. Oh yeah. We love the earth, man. Oh, sure. We could do that, man. We'll give him, like, a, a brain enema, or somethin'. Sure, uh, we just gotta go back to our truck- I'm, I mean our horses and grab some more junk.    Ahahem, that kid looks really sick. No. I mean, he looks REALLY sick, man. You should take him to, like, a doctor. Look, bein' in touch with the earth has nothing to do with dyin', man. Hey, we never said we were Native Americans, man. Miss Information said that. Yeah.  Hey, man, we're glad you're getting better, too. D'you have anymore stuff to sell? We wanna buy more stuff. Hi, uh, I have a little bit of pain in my balls whenever I watch VH1. Wow, I feel better already!  Uugh.  Ptu, ptu. Well, I think they are racist, but I… do think freedom of speech is important. Yes. Much, much more stuff. I didn't know that. Well, I, for one, believe in freedom of speech. …Mmm but then again, I think they ''are'' racist. 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 First and foremost, Mr. Garrison, I would like to thank you for choosing Harequin Romance. Uh yes, Mr. Garrison, we did read your book.  Well, uh, frankly, Mr. Garrison, n-we don't know if the Harequin Romance label is appropriate for you. Mr. Garrison, uh... are you aware that the word "penis" occurs six-thousand and eighty-three times in your novel? Nnnno, I don't think that this book really qualifies as a "romance novel."  No. No, this is what we in the book-publishing business like to call... gay. Really, really gay. It's just that the focus really seems to be on the... male organs. It is.  Hmmm. Look out!  Oops. Four dozen Cherokee hair tampons, please.  Hmm? What?! Gentlemen, I understand you are here to present both sides of an issue. I wanna hear you both out and do this in a civil and constructive manner so that I can give you both the time and attention you deserve. Jimbo, why don't you begin?  Oh, Jesus Christ, not this again! Ahalright, Chef, I'll have my assistants hold up the flag.   Oh, boy. Oh brother, what now?! Ooh, Jesus. What a mess. Chef, we realize that you find the South Park flag racist, and we certainly understand your case.   Well, ''some'' people just won't work with you at all. This is getting out of hand. How do I absolve myself of an responsibility with this? Yes, of course. Let the children be responsible. Everybody loves children. Tell the press. South Park Elementary will be holding a vote on Friday! What? This ''has'' been an interesting week in South Park. We've all done a lot of growing this week.   Ogh! This is terrible, Johnson! Our whole town's economy is going right in the toilet! We've got to get everybody back in the Christmas spirit! Meugh. Send them in. You do?  An animated Christmas card. Kids, that just may be the dumbest idea I've ever heard, ever! But at this point I'm willing to try anything. Johnson, cut them a check for three hundred dollars.  This kids better make a good Christmas movie, Johnson. If people in this town don't start shopping again, we're ''all'' gonna be out of jobs next year. It's alright, we've got a clean-up crew coming.  Oh. Mr. Hankey, it's you. How wonderful. Citizens of South Park, the Colorado Film Commission is pleased to present to you a work by some of our very own South Park children.  We know that after you see this darling short film,  you will all feel the mighty glow of the Christmas spirit once again. Boys? Uhuh, just hang on folks. We seem to be having some technical difficulties. Well, thanks a lot, kids. Great idea you had there. Now everyone is more disenfranchised with Christmas than ever. We want our three hundred bucks back! Fine. Then we'll sue you.  They're starting to understand, Johnson.  Kids, that cartoon was fabulous. How would you like to have your own show and make 100 more of them? Mayor, it's about the South Park flag. We ''cannot'' change the South Park flag, Mayor! Chef, I respect you very much, but you ''have'' to understand that this has ''been'' the South Park flag since some of our ancestors, like my great-grandfather, ''founded'' this land! Chef, what about the baseball team, the Cleveland Indians, huh? Should ''they'' change their name because it's racist? No, because it's their ''history!'' And ''I'm'' telling you it WON'T! This is about history, kids.  And then we'll have to change everything, and pretty soon all our history will be forgotten. But to REALLY understand the South Park's flag's importance, you need to know about South Park's history. Ned here's a big history buff, and he can tell you the whole story. Ned? You sure? You boys go make me proud now and win that debate- Chris Peterson!  God-damnit, we missed him again! Don't change history! Huh? Uh hey now, uh. We don't want ''your'' support. We're not racists; this is about history. Don't change history!  Ned, nobody's gonna vote for our side if it's the side those KKK members are on. Come on, we gotta put a stop to them.  Alright, Ned. We've got to be careful. These are really evil men we're dealing with. Damnit Ned, doesn't that thing have a volume control?  Let's say they should change the flag! I think we should switch sides! Look, we have to accept the fact that most people in the world hate us, right? So, whatever side ''we're'' on is the side that's gonna lose, right? So why don't ''we'' all say that we want the flag changed. That way, most folks'll vote to keep it the way it is.  That worked perfectly, Ned. Jesus, Ned, these guys are completely nuts.  Oh, Jesus, the robes! Chef, this isn't what it looks like. You've gotta listen to us! Ned, I'm starting to think that maybe history ain't worth defendin' sometimes. Yeah. You know, uh I suddenly found myself on the side of Klan members. I've never had anything against blacks, Chef. We've been way too divisive over this, Chef. Maybe we can come up with a- compromise flag—something that everybody can be happy with. I have to admit it, that is a ''lot'' nicer. Holy crow. Look, boys! A real live wild turkey!   That's it. Thaaat's it!  Gotcha!  It was an accident, I swear. Uh, is there any way we can make it up to you? Turkey shoot!   Aaaaah!  Yeah. Yeah!  No, you don't!  What? You... sure you wanna go to Treasure Cove?  This is the end of Smiley Town. The only phone is somewhere in Treasure Cove. If you wanna find it, you're gonna have to cross the white line. Hell no! I'm not crossing the white line. Craig. It's Spaceman Craig.   Take ''that'', kindergartners!  Kindergartners. Treasure Cove is full of them. I got new orders. I'm supposed to take you to see the mayor. Nnneh, in 1867, fourteen pioneers from the East Coast traveled across the Plains- Yeah. Mmm-okay. No. Me too. Nnn-that's a good idea. Mm-yup. Yeah. Uh, marching's really not for me.   White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power!  White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power! Hot shower! Hot shower! Hot shower!  White Power! White Power! White Power!  White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power!  We are here to support your noble cause. Well, whether you want our support or not, we're on your side!  Do not change the flag! It is a symbol of white power! Well, that's enough rallying for this afternoon, members. Let's take a hot shower!  Good evening, brothers. Our first order of business tonight is to have Brother Anderson update us on last week's minutes. Alright. And now it's time for us all to come together, and… do our cake raffle. This week's winner is…  uh, 2 9 7 4. God job, brother.  Alright brothers, listen up!  As you know, this fine city is holding a vote on whether or not to change their flag. But lynching minorities is history! So what are we gonna do about it?! Uh what's that, brother? That's a great idea, brother! Alright, it is decided! We will officially tell everyone that we want the flag changed, so that they will all vote against us! Well alright, now that that's out of the way, it is time to play, "Whose got the silliest thing on under their robe?" Mayor, the-ee South Park Elementary children are discussing the flag issue in their debate club on Friday. This... place is pretty run-down.  WAAGGH! Uhhh, we'll just leave you to your cleanup.  Well, I believe that they are racist, but I do believe that all- Well, anyway, let's get back to work.  Last week we decided we hate blacks and Jews. A lot!  Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!  Wah?  Yeah, m-hm.  Right, yeah.  Yeah!    Wendih.   Wendih, look at me. We're smart!   ''[minus Stan who's mouth is still hanging open as he stares at Wendy] Ra''cist??  Ooooooohhh.  No. Awww. Awww.

Now, I know that this is your first day on the job of mall security, rookie. Keepin' the law in a mall is just like any tough city, and especially because they don't let us have guns. It can be very dangerous.  Excuse me, just where do you think you're goin'? Do you have the proper clearance? You have to make an appointment first. Now move along, sir. Move along, sir. Or I'll do it again.  You see, you put your life on the line every day. Ey!  What are you doin'? Move along, sir.  That's what being a mall cop is all about. Hyeuup.

You wanna play at the mall? Like Tiffany? Oh. Well, I guess. ...What?  Alright, that's enough! Thank you. What?? ...No. Who?? No! Well uh, uh, oh... Right now there's a cheese and sausage cart in the plaza. And I would uh, I'd hate to have to move it off to the side for a while. What? No. I mean, you're just not as good as sausage and cheese. Wow. That was your best?  What? Oh. It's you. I don't like you. Oh. What? Hey. This video is dumb. Alright alright. What? Well, I guess I can move the sausage and cheese cart off to one side.  For a little while. Only for twenty minutes, though. Oh. Okay.  Wow. What?  Hey. Uh, are you gonna do that thing or what? Well hurry up. I can't keep the sausage and cheese cart off this spot much longer.   Alright, kids, uh, that does it. You're gonna have to move and make way for the sausage and cheese cart. Sorry. Get out!  Who? Well. Okay, I guess. But hurry up. Alright, that's it, kids. Get out! Yeah. <poem><i>Fingerbang-bang you ever-y night</i></poem> I've got a new strain of anthrax that I will soon unleash upon all of North America!

You are in CHURCH!  Thank you, Mr. Mackey. Hello, everyone. Today, we're going to talk about hell.  Your ruler of pain and agony! A place of everlasting agony and pain! Hell awaits all sinners and all who do not accept Christ!   Hell is a very real place, Mr. and Mrs. Marsh. I'm trying to save their souls and the souls of everyone in this town from the wretched lake of fire!  Blessed art thou, child. Now, what do you have to confess? Your  con- confession does not leave this box.  Oh. Well, Uh arr-I'm sure he ''would'' forgive you if he knew.  I... see. Okayokay, fine!  Well, has your friend ever confessed or been baptized? Then, hell awaits him. They SHOULD be worried! Boys, it is your Christian duty to save the souls of your friends! Oh. You're the little Jewish boy, right? Well, young man, you can rest assured that according to Matthew 25, when you die you will stand before God and he will will say, "Depart from me, you cursèd, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels." Yes! As a Jew, your home will be the lake of fire. I hope to see ''all'' of you in church this Sunday. Sister, the Jews crucified our Savior. I mean, if you don't go to hell for crucifying the Savior, then what the hell ''do'' you go to hell for?! Whoa!  Son of a bitch!  Uhuh. Kids, uh. Oh! Huh huh. Huh huh.  Oh, forgive me, heavenly Father! I've sinned against you! M-Mrs. Donovan is a temptress from hell!  Today, we are going to talk about hell.

Thanks. See ya, Gary. Thanks for comin'. Oh- Hi, Marsha. Oh, I'd love to, Mr. Matthau, but I can't. Chris and I just moved to the west side and we have to unpack. Bye. Chris? Did you, uh, see my "Boy With An Umbrella" Hummel? Oh, okay, thanks.  Just put the boxes by the-  Saddam... No, it can't be! You're dead! I killed you! Oh no.  Oh, God no. I don't want to talk to you, Saddam! This isn't what I need in my life right now.  Ah. Yeah. Yeah, it's just the movers Okay, Chris.  Oh, why, I haven't heard that one before. I can't, Saddam. I'm with Chris now. Good-bye, Saddam! My life is good now, Saddam. Chris treats me well. You and I are through. Good-bye.  Yeah.  Nothing. Why?  Well, Chris, Saddam showed up today. He showed up spouting all kinds of things about how he's changed and he still loves me... Yeah, well, where was he gonna go? Detroit? ''No, Chris.'' Well, I mean-  Of course, there's a part of me that will always love him, I... But I also know how abusive he was—I'm much happier with you. What? No, Chris, you don't understand. Saddam is fucking crazy.   Oh hi, Chris! What? You WHAT?! Oh, Chris! Rraarr!  No, Chris! He'll try to kill you is what he'll do!   It's all vegetarian, Saddam. Chris was a nutritionist before he died. Good. I'll show you out. He's stable, Saddam! Having stability in your life is a great thing! You should try it! I'm very happy with my life now. No, Saddam! I won't be needing this! Chris, what are you doing? Oh boy. Chris, just... don't... don't do that. No, it's a- When Saddam did it, yeah, but uh... Nothing. I just- I'm just- really tired is all. Can we- just, please go to sleep?  Chris, seriously. I'm just tired, okay? I love you too, Saddam. Waw. Uhuh. I'm sorry, I mean, Chris.  I just need to go get some air. okay? I'll be back... really quick.    Saddam... No, Saddam, I told you. I'm with Chris now. I love you too, Saddam. If I go spend the night with Saddam, then it's over between me and Chris.   Saddam, I'm just here to talk. Saddam, I only came here because I need closure. No! Saddam, listen to me. Um, maybe just... a little one.  What is this? Saddam, will you listen to me?! Chris is a great person. He's the one I wanna be with now.  Saddam...   Oh God, what time is it? I don't know. I-I guess so, but now I have to go home and tell Chris. No, Saddam! I at least owe him an explanation!  Oh, God, Chris is gonna be so mad at me. Well, here it goes.  Hi, Chris.  Yeah, I just... spent the night walking around the marina.   What?  Oh, n-no! I know.  Well... could you not be such a pussy about it? I mean, can't you just say "If you ever see Saddam again, I'll break your legs!" or, or "I'm gonna go kick Saddam's ass!" or something? Just... give me some boundaries, be jealous, go throw a football around, for Christ's sake.   Saddam, what the hell are you doing?!  No! Not like this..!  Oooyeah! Now you are all part of my domain! Everyday in hell grows larger as my minions... my m-minions uh...  Chris!  But I thought you were dead! Chris, I didn't mean for Saddam to stab you in-- Uh... yeah. Gr-great. And now it's like there's one guy who's horrible to me but I'm totally sexually attracted to, and then one guy who's really ''nice'' to me but I'm not sexually attracted to at all. I've asked everybody for advice, but nobody seems to know the answer. Who?  God?? I can't do that. I haven't spoken to God in like, 5000 years. Uh, actually, I'm just stopping by. Ah, look, I just need to talk with God. Is he around? Great. Thanks.   Hi, God. Yeah. No, I have a problem, and I... need your advice. No, it's kind of a long story but, well, it all started when this Iraqi dictator, Saddam Hussein,  was killed by a pack of wild boars. I remember when I first met him in hell. It was a lovely morning in April... ...And now Chris and Saddam just keep killing each other over and over and... I don't know which one to pick. Huh? Well, I just don't know which one to pick. God, you're right. You know, I've had steady relationships for the last... thousand years, and when one ends I just start another one, but... I haven't taken the time to be secure with myself. Hey... Thanks, God. I forgot how clear you make things sometimes. You too. Uh, no, I need to be getting back. Wow. That sounds great, but uh, I really gotta go.  Guys, guys, guys!  Look, you both can stop fighting now! I've made a decision. Yes. I... don't want to be with either one of you. Saddam, you're an asshole. And you'll never be the friend that I want. And Chris, well, you're a pussy. And you'll never be the ''lover'' I want.  No, I'm not going on a walk! You're a pussy, Chris, and you drive me crazy; go away!  Hi, Bob. Hi, Rick.  Awgh... Not again. Saddam, I told you, I don't need you anymore! Yes, I can! '''''Raaarrr!'''''  Goodbye forever, Saddam! Not this time. I asked a favor of an old friend of mine to let you in. Hennnh!  Great luau, Satan. Satan, a few of us are gonna go pound some brews. You wanna join us? Oh, well, maybe next time. Great luau!  Yeah? Uuh, no, but there's still some boxes coming from the movers.  Is that the movers, Satan? Oh, well, tell them I'm leavin' their check on the counter.  Those were some great pork chops, Satan. Hey, you.  You've been actin' strange all night. What's up? Well, it's... just that you've washed that same dish seven times now, silly.  Come on, Satan. You know you can tell me anything. What's up?  I wasn't ready for that. I thought you... killed him. ...Do you still love him? It's okay of you do. Well, you know what I think we should do? I think we should all get together and just talk, like adults. We're all grown men here, Satan. I wanna just go meet this guy. Oh, I know he's got the whole bad-boy thing going. But I think that's what you were attracted to. But I can be a pretty rough tumbler myself.   There you are. I've been lookin' all over for you. I have to tell you somethin' that might make you... a little mad. Well, I called Saddam Hussein and invited him over for dinner tonight. I just think we all need to get this out in the open.  Come on, Satan. We're all adults here. He was an important person in your life, for better or for worse. So, I wanna know him. If he sees that I'ma real person too, then... well, maybe he'll see how happy we are together. Satan, we're not in junior high school anymore. Oh, hello. You must be Saddam Hussein.  Oh, thank you. Satan, what the heck is wrong with you? Well, come on in. Dinner's just about ready. So Saddam. Satan told me all about how you guys almost took over the world once. Oh, well I, I actually slipped down an escalator, in a mall. Those things can be pretty sketchy. L-look, Saddam, I know that you and Satan had a relationship  that I'm totally okay with you guys staying friends. I think it's important to stay friends with people you've had relationships with.  Right. ''Hoof''. Well, I don't know about ''you'' guys, but all that ginger made me tired. Nice to meet you, Saddam! Have a safe walk back!   You take it now! I'm just... I'm just trying to be a little more naughty in bed. I uh... I know that's what you like about sex with Saddam. I'm just... showin' you that I can be that way, too.  I'm a bad boy. Yeah. Take that. But it turns you on. But what?  Okay. I love you, Satan. It's okay. It's okay. I, uh, I, I understand. ...I do. Yeah. Sure. Okay.  I love you, Satan. Hey, you. You... were out all night. Satan. You know you're not a very good liar. You went and saw Saddam, didn't you?  Satan, I understand. I still feel secure and safe with you.  What? What's wrong? I said it's okay. Well, what more do you want from me? Satan, I'm a '90s man. I cry when I need to. I share my feelings and I keep my mind open about everything.  Now you're starting to hurt my feelings. '''''Agghhh!'''''  'Scuse me. Excuse me. Yeah, well, where was I gonna go? Detroit? Hey, it's alright. All that matters is that I'm back, and we're together forever. Right? Yeah. It's me. Yeah... Do you have a couple of minutes to go for a walk? Yeah. Just real quick. Around the park or somethin'. No, I just want you to go for a quick walk with me. Please? Saddam, I get the feeling that you don't like me very much. Look, Satan is a very important person to me. And I know he's an important person to you, too. So don't you think it's best for us to just... try and get along? I realize that some things about me bother you. So I'd like to hear what those things are so that I can work on them. '''''Agghhh!'''''  '''''Oh God!''''' '''''Nooo! Agh!'''''  Ow!  Ow..!  '''''Aagghh!'''''  You have? Satan. Can we go for a walk in the park? Fine.  Hello, Satan!   Did you miss me, buttercup? ''Yeah'', you killed me. So? Where was I gonna go? Detroit? Come on, guy. Just let me in so we can talk. Satan, look: I know our relationship wasn't perfect. Okay? I know that. I was too busy tryin' to take over the world to give you what you needed. But I've changed, Satan.  COME ON, can't we just go out for a burrito?  ¡Me gusta burrito mucho! Who?? Screw 'im! He can't pound your ass like I can! Wait. Wait, I'm sorry, heh. But Satan, you can't deny what's between us.  You can try, but you ''know we belong'' together.  And you must be Mr. Assface.  Yeah! Hey, relax, guy. We're all here to act like adults, right?  Hn-yeah, those were the days, boy. What the hell ''is'' this crap we're eating, anyway? Oh, isn't that fascinating. So, tell me, Chris. How is it that you died? An escalator? What kind of pussy way of dying is that?! Uh huh. Yes. I guess I should be gettin' back.  Yeah. Thanks for the weak grass and twigs and stuff.  Satan, that guy is a pussy! Yes, that's what I said! He's a pussy! For some people, maybe. But ''you'' like excitement. I know you, Satan.  Here.  I'm at the bargain hotel on Monte Vista. Room 16. D'oh, I know you won't. But just keep it, just in case. It was good seeing you again, Satan. Goodnight.  Goodnight, pussy! I mean, Chris! Hello, Satan!   What took yo so long, baby? Great! Let's talk!  Hmm, this bed is comfy-bumpy. Sounds fun. You know me, I'll try anything. Would you like a drink? These hotels have all kinds of crazy channels.  Well, I don't know about you, but this video is gettin' me pretty hot! Here, have another drink.   Ewuh, I'm all greasy. Last night was awesome! Are we together again now? Screw him!! I know how to solve this little problem.   There. I got rid of the problem for you. Now there's no conflict. Hello Satan-ooh, crap! It's you! I thought I killed you! Right, right. A ''walk?''  Is this some kind of trick? Well, alright. Just let me grab somethin' real quick.  Gee, whatever gave you that idea? When I stabbed you in the head? You know why I don't like you, Chris? Because you're the kind of guy who, if someone didn't like him, would take him for a walk in the park and ask him why. You're a pussy!  Ah hahaha! '''''Aggghhh!'''''  '''''Die, pussy!'''''  '''''Aagghh!'''''  Hell, you can't leave ''me'', Satan! I won't let you!   There you are! You know you can't live without me. Now '''''get that ass back to bed!''''' You can't leave me, Satan. Nobody leaves me. Aw, you little..prick!  What are you talking about? You can kill me, but I'll be back tomorrow. Let me in where?  What the..? Hey, what the hell is this place?! Ey, who the hell are you? Nooo! N-'''''nooooooooooo!''''' Hello, children. I'm Sister Anne. And I'll be teaching you so that you can all receive your First Communion. Well, hopefully not. That's why you're gonna need to receive Communion. It doesn't matter, because we are all born with Original Sin. Now, let me explain how Communion works.  No. Yes. In the Book of Mark, Jesus distributed bread and said, "eat this, for it is my body." Nononono! The Body of Christ!  No! Look: all you have to know is that when the priest gives you the cracker, you eat it! Okay?! And then, you will drink a very small amount of wine, for that, is the Blood of Christ. Eric, do you wanna go to hell?! Then stop questioning me. No. Because before you can take your first Communion, you have to have your first Confession. You'll be getting in the Confession box with a priest and confessing all your sins, so that God can forgive you. You kids will all have to go to your first Confession this Tuesday, so I want you all to go home tonight and think long and hard about all your sins, so that you can tell the priest everything.  Oh, hello, children.  Okay, shoot.  The handicapped are just people like you and me, so the same rules apply. They need to be baptized, take Communion, and confess their sins. Uugh. This really isn't a question for me, it's for the priest.   I have to ask you a question. Father, the children asked me about their handicapped friend. I wanna explain to them that he's fine. Father, these boys are really worried because they think they have to- Yes, but- Father-  Father, I don't know if I agree fully with what you're saying. I think that as long as Jewish people are good, they ''will'' get into heaven. Yes. The priest here has been telling the children some pretty radical things, and I just wanted to see what the Church thinks about Jews and the mentally handicapped. Hello, His Holiness. I want to ask you about people with mental disabilities. Do mentally-challenged people go to hell?  Handicap. Mental handicap.  ...The priest here said that people with mental handicaps might end up in hell. Is that true?  Oh no.  Eric, you need to stop what you're doing. You need to tell all the kids to go back to school, and back to their normal lives. Yes, Eric. A lot more than you have. Eric, the Lord just doesn't send everybody to hell. That wouldn't make sense. He wants people to live their lives. No.   Alright kids, it's time to go. It's time for this to stop! I know you won't listen to me. That's why I brought somebody else.  O-kay. We will be.  Yes, I understand you want to speak-a wit the pope. Yes, well the pope is here, but please keep it brief. He is a-very old.  Heh?? Heh?  Heh?!  Fibibiibibibibiibibih.   Wuh?! Oh, the pain! Oh, the pain!  I don't wanna to go to hell.   Dad? Robby! Robby, no!   Wuh?! Fonz, there's no way you can jump that shark with your water skis.  I told him he couldn't do it.  Aaaay! I've gotta try, Richie. Aaaaaa--   No! Go Fonz!!! Yeah!  I will. Wagghh..! Whoa! Wagghh!  Forgive us, Lord. Whoa! Praise the Lord! ''Do dodo dum do dodo<br />Do dodo dum do dodo'' Wooooo! Hooray! Amen!   Wow! Cool/Wow. Yeah! Wow.  Fingerpaint! Fingerpaint! Yeah Yay!  Bravo. Hooray! Alright!  <poem><i>She's never gonna do it.

You're not gonna make my daughter part of your cult!  She didn't want to, Kevin. She... had no choice. Stephen?  Stephen, no!  Stephen? ''Stephen?'' Where... where am I? Hello, newcomers, and welcome. Can everybody hear me?  Uh, I'm the hell director. Uh, it looks like we have about 8,615 of you newbies today, and for those of you who are a little confused, uh, you ''are'' dead, and this is hell, so, abandon all hope and uh yada yada yada. Uh, we are now going to start the orientation process, which will last about-- Alright parents, let's all take our seats.  My name is Scott Evans, and I am a prison rehabilitation counselor. Yes, well I'm afraid you were wrong. Uh, you picked the wrong religion as well. I'm afraid it was the Mormons. Yes, the Mormons were the correct answer. So now I'd like to quickly introduce your new ruler and master for eternity, Satan. Uh, okay. Thank you, Satan. Now, uh, let's begin with the Muslims...  I'm gonna heal your sins-eh. Well, where was I gonna go? Detroit? Wow, that really sucks. Well, there is one person who I always used to ask when I needed advice. God. Well then, maybe it's time. Yes! Wagh... Hi hi, welcome to heaven, brother. You've followed the Mormon faith, and so you've been let in! And then, Brother Stephen's brought his guitar so we can sing songs about how much it hurts to lie. I'm so grateful for that. Yes, would you? Well, he seemed like a nice fellow. We're glad you made it, brother. Well, you've picked a great time! We've got cookies and punch and we're just about to start playing charades. Sure. All you have to do is say his name and he's there. Would you like to stay for some cookies and punch? Oh, alright then, but you're gonna miss our big play. Let's go make things out of egg cartons.  Alright. Yeah. Ooooh!  Me, too. Uh huh.  Oooh, yeah. I'll do that.  Yes. Come on. Let's go. Yeahahah!  Yea. Look upon me, and know me. Hello, Satan.  It's... been a long time. What brings you here? Do you wish to mount your unholy war against heaven? You want to rule more than hell? You want to destroy the Earth?  Jesus, what the hell happened to you? You got kicked out of here for being a headstrong rebel. And now you're a whiny little bitch. No, you've become dependent on relationships. So you haven't even considered the option of not being with ''either'' of them.  And if you're not sexually attracted to someone, you're not ever going to be. But Saddam isn't right either. He's the other extreme. You need to spend time alone so that you can find the balance, the middle ground. That's what I always do, because I'm a Buddhist. Bingo.  It was nice to see you again, Satan. Goodbye.  Yes. We're going to do a play about how alcohol can ruin family life. Yes.  What? Hey, Bill Cosby. '''''Agggghhh!'''''   What?! Kids, you need to all stop spending all your time here and go back to school. God doesn't want you to spend all your time being afraid of hell, or praising His name. God wants you to spend your time helping others, and living a good, happy life. That's how you live for Him. But Eric, I think this time I have to teach you a lesson. I'm sending you somewhere to think about your sins! No. Worse!  Back to our courageous story of a little boy's triumph over obesity. Eric, yea. You found that the Spirit of the Lord inside you gave you strength. A little boy who overcame the odds. Let's hear it for Eric Cartman!   Thanks for coming on the show, Kenny. So. Kenny, how did you discover that you had this... talent? I can't say I approve of this, my children. Because Kenny is only doing things that anybody could do. For money. He's a prostitute. You have blemished the meaning of Christmas for the last time, Kringle! Christmas is for celebrating my birth! Hi, Satan. I'm doing great! Why don't you come on out and we'll get you oriented.  I'll take care of him from here, ma'am. Eric, this is the beginning of a whole new life for you!  Alright! Everybody's here and that means we can get down to business! Over the next few weeks we're gonna learn that losing weight is ''[jumps] fun'', right gang? Wait a second.  I could've swore that- Oh no, kids! It's glutinous fat! Oh! What are we going to do? Wait! I know! I could knock it out! With... Exercise!  I guess we took care of that bad old fat, didn't we kids? Well, hold on a second. Because that glutinous fat was really our good friend, Susan,  Doing great kids! Come on!  Well, I sure enjoyed ''my'' carrots and protein bar! How about you, gang? Hey kids! Escape-aroo! Now campers, I know that camp is tough, but you have to believe that you can do it. And you have to know that until you drop the weight, you can't leave. So let's just all put on our try-hard helmets, and accept that the only way for us to get out of camp, is to LOSE THE WEIGHT! Alright campers, good work today. Lights out, and we'll see you tomorrow for more exercise and proper diet.  I don't know what we're doing wrong, Susan. These kids aren't losing the weight. They'll do it. And we're gonna reach for the sky...  And down to the ground.  And up to the sky...  What's happening? Oh! But he's not ready yet. They ''can'' lose the weight if they try. Good-bye, Chad. Naturally. Oh, don't thank us. We failed you. Well, it's alright with me. Parents? Bubbye.  Hello, and welcome. We're just about to do a play, about how much stealing hurts you deep inside. Come join us.  You're here forever.  Get out of my way, you little dorks!  Yeah, but ''now, we're fifth-graders'', you stupid fourth-graders, so move it!  What? Thi-ird Uhuhuhow. YEAH!!! YEAH!!!  My name is Ms. Choksondik.  And it is time to go to work!  Well, young man, I hope you have a good explanation for this. This is the ''fourth grade''! You need to grow up!  Now, get back to your desk and write a thousand-word essay on why you feel you need to disrupt my class.  SILENCE! Principal Victoria, I would like a word!  My new students are the most misbehaved, illiterate, brain-dead group of children I have ever come across! One of them is mentally ''handicapped'', for Christ's sake! The one in the wheelchair! Look, I would like to have a talk with their last year's teacher! Who was it? Mr. Uh-heh, Garrison?!  Why?! Where did he go?! But I need help reaching these kids! I have nothing but the highest expectations for them. And with  God as my witness- I'm going to teach these kids the wonders of the world, so that they can reach the top!  I hope that sometime very soon you will let me in on what happened to this Mr. Garrison! And with that I will bid you good day!  Alright, children, I hope you all did your homework last night. Please pass your papers up to the frontuh.  I said, pass your papers to the fronteh! It's Choksondik! And you are all going to have detention! What are you doing?! Well, well, well! I'd say somebody has some explaining to do! Children! Children, come back here! I HAVE HAD IT!!! These children are out of control! I must speak with their last year's teacher, Mr. Garrison!  What in God's name happened to him? And, nobody has found him? I see.  Then the only way I'll find the secret to teaching these kids is to go up into those mountains and find Mr. Garrison ''myself''! Oh, I'll find him! Even if I have to climb up  and up!  What? Hello-oo-ooo.  Mister? Mr. Garrison? I am the new fourth grade teacher. I've come to... seek your help.  Please. I don't know how to handle the new fourth graders. I've tried everything. I need to know how ''you'' taught them. Mr. Garrison, you knew how to reach these kids! You're my only hope! Choksondik. Mr. Garrison, these children are depending on me to give them a future. I can't do it without your guidance. Please! Help me, for them! For the future of our children! ...Done. "Children, we are now going to do math problems." "Uuh! Ah, you ''will'' do them or else you'll be in very big trouble!" "Don't use that kind of language, young man!"  No?? Oh. Pre-sent them? I'm ready. I'm not afraid. What lives inside? Oh, alrighty.  Alright, children, I hope you all did your-   Oh Good Gravy, not this again. Children, I will have order!! Children, get back into your seats! Eric, I mean it!  You said, "suck my balls." Well, go ahead. Whip 'em out, and I'll suck 'em. Now, children, listen to me. Why do you want to go back in time? Life isn't about going back, it's about going forward. Yes, there are times in our life that we wish we could relive, but, if we already lived them perfectly, why live them again? The adventure of life is that there's always something new. New challenges, new experiences. A fun game is a game that gets ''harder'' as it goes. So it is with life. Do you understand? Alright, students, that will be quite enough! If you're ready, let's continue on... with the fourth grade.  Alright, children, as I'm sure you all remember, today we are going to continue our biology lesson... dissecting an organism.  Manatees are mammals that live in the oceans and are often called the gentle clowns of the sea. They sure are, Wendy, and that's why we must learn what's inside them.   Now, children, our first incision will be along the abdomen. And now we will be removing the spleen. Notice how the manatee's spleen is designed for a qu-  Oh dear.  Well, I think people are just fed up with the crowded shopping and the credit-card bills, uh.  I, I think that the holiday just has become a joke. We got so caught up in the little things of Christmas, like love and family that... we almost forgot it's buying things that makes our economy thrive. I can't take it, man! Writing in cursive?? Fractions?? ''I can't do i-it!'' When it comes to time-traveling theory, there are basically two school of thought. The Spock Theory is that a sling shot around the sun could create a wormhole in which time could not escape. The Lieutenant Commander Data Theory, however, is that a nag vibration could create a rip in the time-space continuum- Oh. Heeeyyy.  This kid's electric wheelchair might be just what we need. Alright, when we power up, the handicapped kid's chair will accelerate at a high rate of speed about 10 feet that way , then make the required magnetic vibrations. Now, eh, when you all see a wormhole, yuh-you guys are gonna have about 4.2 seconds to run through it. Primary fusion initiated. I didn't think it would work. No! Look, the system malfunctions if he stops. The nuclear core can bake his magnetic field and the whole chair will blow sky-high. No! Uh, well, it's a simple hydrogen-fusion core with a veltig reactant- This has never happened in all the 72 original ''Star Trek'' episodes. ...No, there were 72.  Hey, it ''did'' work.  Huh? Oh... Can't. I can't, because pizza-face isn't here! We're not on speaking terms! We got in a big fight and he moved all his stuff out! There's 73 original Star Treks! He keeps saying there's 72! No! He actually thinks there's 72.! No. Pizza-face took all his equipment home to his mom's. Now, if you can go over there and get him to admit that he's ''wrong''... I can't wait for Gene Roddenberry to tell you how WRONG you are! Just like when you said there were no two-parters of Battlestar Galactica! The episode called "Gonzo on Ice Planet Zero" was a two-parter. I'll kill you!  Time-travel is no laughing matter. Four times the Enterprise went back in time, and four times they almost didn't make it back. It's all theoretical, but from a scientific standpoint, the creation of a rip in space-time ''is'' possible. We just need to find an inertia device.  If the fields are right, it should then create a wormhole up near the front of the classroom. And on the other side you will find yourself in exactly the same spot, only one year ago. Molecular grenadine active.  Me neither. We've rigged the chair to be sensitive to his weight. If he gets off, the whole thing blows! Which just turned into a time bomb. Yah... wait, you mean 73 episodes. No there weren't!  What?! Look! There aren't 73 episodes of Star Trek, there are 72! "The Menagerie" was a 2-parter that counts as one episode! Pizza-face is wrong! I know! Why does he have to be such a dick about it?! No, because he's WRONG! And live in a world of 72 original Star Treks? I don't think so! I don't want to live in that world.   What?!  Dude, Jesus, you're right. There WEREN'T! No it WASN'T! Aww Oooo! Yup. Closer!  Look out, Hansen! Ten seconds, Hansen! ...six, five... Oh!  Aaaah! Oh my God, what's going on? What?!  AAAH!! Omigod! Omigod!  O-kay. O-kay. Omigod. Okay. I kept the speed at 5. Oh my God! Less than 20 minutes! Oh my God, Oh my God! Oh my God!  Oh my God! Oh my God!  But if we got off the chair it blows up! Oh.  See ya!  Have you got any candy?  Dear Jesus! Hang on, lady! Ma'am, be very careful! That wheelchair is set to explode! It's okay! Just stay calm and keep the speed above 5! Good! What's the wheelchair's battery power at? It's alright, everything's goin' tuh be fine.  Alright, young man, when you get underneath that wheelchair, I want you to relay back to me with this walkie-talkie, and then I'll tell you which wires to cross. Ready? Go below!  Stay calm! You have to stay calm!  No no, that's only if the boy gets off. Got it! I think! Up, up!  NOOO!! Tom, I'm standing about two miles outside of Denver where the darling handicapped boy fights for his life on a wheelchair of death.  Guys, can you tell us what kind of explosive we're actually dealing with here.  Tom, I understand that now, the rescuers are gonna try and send in one of the handicapped boy's little friends, in an attempt to keep him calm and hopefully, disarm the device.  I am your gay side. You must face me at last.  It is me, your darkest fear. Your gay self, incarnate. I want you to not fight me anymore. To accept me, once and for all. Don't you see?  Of who... we are. Oh, stop it! What about the time you looked at Counselor Mackey's penis in the men's locker room?! For seven minutes?! And what about the time you masturbated to the men's 100-meter swimming relay at the Olympics?! THERE WERE NO CHICKS! ADMIT IT! YOU HAVE TO STOP LYING TO YOURSELF AND GET A G- My gay side, uh- I DON'T HAVE A GAY SIDE!!! You aren't real! You can't be! What do you want? Why? But I'm not gay! Everyone just thinks I am! I was just comparing size! Aaa!  I was beating off to the chicks! OH, DAMN YOU SPIRIT! HAUNT ME NO LONGER! NO!!! ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT, I ADMIT IT! I'M GAY!!!  and it feels good. OnStar]]. '''''Sit down and shut up!!''''' HOW LONG HAVE I GOT TO SIT HERE? HELL, I'LL DO SIX HOURS FOR THE FIVE HUNDRED BUCKS YOU'RE PAYING ME! I feel great! I haven't had this much attention paid to my coot since I was 16! I told you I was a tight virgin flower. I was held back ten human grades.  I mean, grades. Do you companion-friends know Eric Cartman? Eric Cartman? And you have a ''Dawson's Creek'' Trapper Keeper Futura S 2000? Yes. Yes, I do.  May I hold your Trapper Keeper? Ahhh, hello Eric. Can I be your human friend?  I mean, friend? Please. We can have ''fun'' and play games, like human four square--  I mean, four square.   Wagh! '''''Gaagghhh!'''''  Please. You do not understand.  That Trapper Keeper has to be destroyed! Nooo! Listen to me! I am not really Bill Cosby.  My name is BSM-471. I am a cyborg engineered by humans from the year 2034. Hey, there he is. That's the kid that's s'posed to be some kind of genius. Come on.  So, you think you're smarter than the rest of us? Do you think you know more about the world just because you are only 3 and we're 5? Yeah, he's only three and he's already in kindergarten. I nominate Filmore, because he's the smartest kid in the class. Here.  We're gonna be here all night! Why don't you guys just concede? We want a recount. Count them again.  You're just saying that, 'cause you know you're gonna lose now. Well, just you wait, 'cause my famous aunt is on huh way right now. My aunt Rosie, Rosie O'Donnell. Yeah, she's very active in politics. So she's gonna set all this straight. Aunt Rosie! That's my aunt, Rosie O'Donnell. Aunt Rosie. We think I won class president. Mistoreh Garrison, I concede.  I don't wanna play anymore, 'cause this game is stupid. Ike, you could be class president. We already played with our parents.  Oh no! She's crossing the white line! Here. No! You want Ike to be president. Why don't you just concede? Wait one minute! I think the ballot were misleading. Some kids didn't understand whom they were voting for. No, I'm saying that because ''you'' are a boogerface! Yeah. It doesn't make any sense.  Can we fingerpaint now? ''[its TV screen turns on] Trapper Keeper active.'' ''Ready for hybrid.

Alright, I'll pay 100 geliga stones-- Uh, I mean, human dollars! Eugh, I mean dollars!  Can we play some human tetherball? Serve!  Got it! I don't know...  Um, I vote for... I don't know. Okay. Um... I decided. Umm... Ike. Flora, just say you vote for Filmore so we can all go home. Yeah! Yeah!  Filmore! Ike! Eric, I'm not gonna shoot anybody for taking your school folder. Hey!  Bill Cosby? Well, I knew you weren't Bill Cosby! Huh? Oh, I'm sorry. I wasn't listening. I have come to destroy that Trapper Keeper, because it was the ''Dawson's Creek'' Trapper Keeper that belongs to an Eric Cartman in South Park which three years from now manifests itself into an omnipotent super being, and destroys all of humanity. In the year 2004, a hybrid-assimilating computer linked with a satellite uplink computer. From there it was able to slowly take over every computer in the world.  And so finally, the humans decided to send one of their robots into the past to destroy the Trapper Keeper before it even got started. And so, Eric. Now you see why we must ''destroy'' your Trapper Keeper. Good morning, humans. I have successfully destroyed Eric Cartman's Trapper Keeper. I broke it apart, dipped the motherboards in acid, burned the memory chips, and sent the wiring to the four corners of Canada. Well, that is a problem that is causing me some disconcernment. I am still here, but I shouldn't be here. If Trapper Keeper has been stopped, then I should not exist. But here I am. Something is still not right.  Oh no! We will have to destroy this Trapper Keeper. Well, that does it!  I'm afraid I have no other choice.  For the sake of humanity, I have to kill him. What? Oh, well, I suppose.  Wait!  Perhaps there is another way. If you could take me to where Eric Cartman lives, I could try reasoning with his human mother. I'm afraid I can't. I think I'm actually starting to feel what you humons call "compassion". It is an amazing feeling! And so you see, Ms. Cartman, you cannot buy your son Eric another Trapper Keeper. Not now! Not ever! Correct. Good. Now all that is left to do is destroy the Trapper Keeper Eric has now. Where is he?  Oh no! It is heading for Cheyenne Mountain! It was when the Trapper Keeper assimilated with the supercomputer at Cheyenne Mountain that it was able to fuse into all defensive computers! A part of your friend must still be alive in there.  That must be what Trapper Keeper is using for ventilation. If one of you could get in there, you could reach the CPU. It is infusing with everything. It is already too powerful to stop! Look! I think that infusing with Rosie O'Donnell has made Trapper Keeper sick. Look! I'm fading!  Yay! Yeah!  Absent kids count! Absent kids count! Absent kids count! Yay./Hooray.  Recount! Recount! Recount! Recount! Wait, there's still that absent kid. Yeah. If Carlos is absent, we have to wait for ''his'' vote. Awww..! ''Trapper Keeper ready to ensorb. [cables reach out and grab Cartman's computer like a giant hand, and pull it towards the Trapper Keeper]'' ''Trapper Keeper, merging. [cables reach out and grab a lamp and a Wellington Bear desk clock]'' Hello, kids! Don't worry, kids. Everything's gonna be fine. What's the problem? Well it obviously isn't that simple, is it? I mean, you'd ''think'' a little kindergarten teacher could've handled this, but now we're gonna do it ''my'' way!  Okay, so then what we're going to do is count everybody's vote by hand, and after that, we're gonna go over the votes again manually, and then--  We're just making sure that the kids that voted for my nephew don't get cheated!  No, Ike won. Hey, Mark, look. Oh, no! Now there's two of those things! Huh? Which one? I-It's just like I'm seeing double. HAL 9000]]] What are you doing, Kyle?'' Aaghh!  Wagghh!  What are you doin'?! Get out of my way!  Is this the kindergarten classroom? That's right! I believe the African-American in your class were misrepresented! Oh. Bye.  What kind of turkey are you lookin' for? Well, I ain't got a whole lot left, it bein' almost Thanksgiving and all.   Oh, that one's a little messed up. Not exactly the... pick of the litter. Yeah. Best you not take that one. I was just about to take it out in the yard and putt a bullet in its head. Fifty bucks. I know! Now I gotta find somethin' else to shoot. I've got a one-legged pig if you'd like, too.  I would swear it on my life. Your play shall want for nothing. Now, the first thing a good musical needs is a big opening number. Something that sets up the entire show.  Wait! What's that, you say? A thanksgiving turkey is what you require? I know of a turkey.  During my years on Broadway I... worked with a turkey who could do all kinds of tricks. She even jumped through a hoop of fire. I will go promptly and call her trainer. On the morrow you shall have your trick performing turkey. He's not gonna work, Kyle. The whole point was to make our play better than the kindergartners. <poem><i>1800's, Alabama! What a great place and time!<br />We're so happy that we live in 1800's Alabama 'cause it's sunny and there is no crime!</i></poem>  Now to the refrain! Whoa-aaaa   Let him rest in peace. Let him rest. Why must he die? —and into your hands  <poem><i> How is it going, Eric?</i></poem> Well, you know in theater sometimes, we try different tricks to get the creative juices flowing. Let's see.   Well, did you see anything? ...Oh, that's too bad.  I do. I know the part. If I must, I can go on. <poem><i><br />I think our baby's deaf and blind. Oh no!</i></poem> Wawa. <poem><i>Now that I can communicate the world is not so cold and dark. </i></poem>  Excuse me, I am Lamond, the animal trainer. Ap ap! Do not call them tricks! She's a very sensitive turkey! She performs feats, not tricks. Ladies and gentlemen, may I present the most beautiful bird in America!  Of course she is!  What... is... that?! My turkey does not work with other turkeys! Alright, ah ah alright! Alri- ah a-alright. Alright.  She's not coming out. She's very upset! She's pooped all over the room!  Kill the other turkey! Well, it could meet with "an unfortunate accident." It's very simple! Either that turkey meets with an unfortunate accident, or ''you'' don't have a feat-performing turkey for your Helen Keller Thanksgiving musical!  Little boy. Yes, Tim. I feel I must speak with you.  The others, well, they don't want you to know, but, oh, I don't know what to do. Should I tell you? I feel I'm the only one who can be honest with you.  The animal shelter is on its way to...take your turkey away from you. You see, they don't allow children in your... situation... to have wild animals as pets. You can't take him running, you can't take care of him. They... have to take it away. They take wild pets away from people like you... and hand them over for experiments. And they're shocked, dissected, and flayed while they're still alive. And no matter where you go, the shelter people will find you. The only way for that turkey to avoid years of torture is for you to... let him go. Back into the wild.  Quick, go! And set your turkey free! I'll try to stall them. Uh, the stage is right through there.  You're going to be brilliant, you sexy, gorgeous turkey. With that other meddling animal out of the way, you'll steal the show!  She's brilliant! Everyone loves her so far.  Oh, heh. Look, Tim, all is well in love and theatre, right? Haha.  Oh. Back already? Don't worry. Maynard covered your part flawlessly.  Alinicia! Jesus, no! Wow. Eh, excuse me, we're here to install the water effects for the musical? Thanks.  Look, we're only here to do the water effects. We're not in charge of electrical. That's a different union.  Then why did you do it??  Have you done the right things in ''your'' life?   Come on. Yaah! Move it! Were is Timmy?! He's on in one minute!  Aaaaaaa! Happy Thanksgiving.   Whoa!  Ew!  Nah nah nanah nah! Wha' are you doin' 'ere, you little whippersham! Wha' are you doin' wit' those?  Here. W-why are you easy to help me? Allo, Pip. You remember me?  Yes. After you helped me I moved to Wales and made somethin' o' myself. If it weren't for you, I'd have never become a millionaire. Because back then you treated me like any other person. You're weren't a snob and you helped me as you would a rich man.   Pip, where 'ave you been?! What the hell's lovely about it?!  Joe, teach this boy some bloody cynicism! A lot of bloody good a fire poker's gonna do while I'm starvin' to death! Why don't you make us some bloody food to eat! STOP your metal orange, you bastard! You never want a tablespoon of nigh'ingale droppin's, you me'al-poundin' fairy!  And you! Why don't you ge' a job?! You're eight years old now! Shut up, you silly lip! What are we supposed to do with a metal newspaper? Where?  "Havisham residence seeks young boy to play with lonely daughter. Will pay up to..." TWENTY QUID A DAY?? I don't know about that. I just thought I'd keep to me blacksmithing.    I've gone and made a metal newspaper! Well, for starters we can look in the want ads and see if we can find Pip a job. ''Ohhh'', lookie here! Young man wanted for paid position! You can keep a little girl company for 20 quid a day, Pip. And Old Mrs. Havisham is the wealthiest woman in the town.   Your very own metal fuzzy dice. Eeyyyy, what's all this, Pip?  Sure! They're those things with vaginas in them.  Oh. D'ooooh. No, I don't think so, Pip.  The same. Oh, well, uh Pip's not for sale, sir. Heaven forbid I should stand in the way of Pip's future, but- That's great news!  I am, sir.  A young gentleman! Of great expectations! Pip? Pip, old chap?  That's right. You're safe and warm now. Well, about that, Pip: There's another person who wants to see you.  'E's the one that sent you to London, Pip! 'E's the one who sent you off to be a gentleman! What's that, Pip. Yeah!   Your manhating days are over, Ms. Havisham!   Oy can't figh' 'em off no moh!  You did it, Pip!  Well, I guess Old Ms. Havisham won't be takin' any revenge on any more blokes, ey?  Who is that?  Does it frighten you to look upon a woman who has not seen the sun in over 20 years? I sometimes have sick fancies.  And I have a fancy I should like to see someone play. So, play. Play. Estella, play with this boy.  But, you can break his heart. What do you think of her? Hm-m-m. What else? Hm, you quite fancy her, don't you? Come back again next week. We shall "play" some more.  Yes, good. She will break his pathetic heart into a million pieces. Come closer, Pip.  My, you're quite the gentleman now, aren't you? Perhaps. Estella's been off to school as well.  Ohoh, you love her, don't you, Pip? Do you know what love is, Pip? It is blind devotion, unquestioning self-humiliation, utter submission, trust and belief against yourself and against the whole world, giving up your whole heart and soul to snip it. Love her, Pip. I developed her into what she is so that she might... be loved. There's a dance at the Palace tomorrow night. Estella will be there. Go and seek her out. And love her. ''Love her!'' And if she warms to you, love her; she tears your heart into pieces. And as you get older it will tear deeper.  Lover her. Well well well, if it isn't Mr. Pip.  Don't they make a handsome couple, Pip?  Look at the way he holds her hand. Things aren't always as they seem, Pip.  Oh, what's the matter? Did she... break your heart? Yes. Tell me about the pain.  Tell me about the crushing and the prickly things. Yes, and it is somewhat difficult to breathe.  Is your heart broken as well? Tell me all about it. Wuh-hy? Well, that's simple. Because I need the tears of broken-hearted men to use in my Genesis device.  You see, my foolish child, I'm growing very old. But tonight I will fuse my soul into Estella's once and for all. And then I can go on breaking men's hearts for another generation. Estella, prepare yourself for the Genesis platform.  And as for you, Pip, my robot monkeys should take care of you!  Are you ready, Estella? Are you ready to complete the cycle? Quite the contrary, blacksmith. My revenge on the male race is only about to begin. Yes. Cry away, males.  Once your tears have collected into the Genesis device, the fusion of Estella and me will be complete. Won't I?   It begins. ...Yes... Yessss!   But he's just a commoner! ...Alright, boy, let us play.  We're going to play a little game called, "Smack the Blond Boy In the Head With a Large Log."   And, do you still think I'm insulting? I hate you! You're an oozing, painful hemorrhoid that belches pus! You may kiss me if you like.  Just another playmate hired to amuse me. You didn't think you were the only ''one'', did you? Oh, you silly small-testicled boy. Come, let us walk through the rose garden.  Pip.  My goodness, how you've changed! I suppose.  So how is it that you've learned to dress and dance? Iiii see, and you no longer live with the blacksmith? Naturally.  Is it? Why?  Pip, you must know that I have no heart. Oh, I have a heart to be shot or stabbed in, no doubt, and if it cease to beat I should cease to be, but  you know what I mean. I have no softness there, no sympathy, sentiment. Alright, Steve. Just one moment.  That is Steve. He is seventeen and has a car. I should. He's my boyfriend. What's the matter, Pip?! It's... it's... the way it goes sometimes, Pip.  Yes, Mother.  Pip?  It is... what I was raised for.  I told you, Pip. I have no heart.  Oh my. 'E's very cute. I don't want to. I don't see the point in this. I don't want to kill any more of them. You think so? Let me see it  Maybe I ''can'' kill it. Yes. her poor miserable life is finally over. Yes! Yes, my small-testicled love!  Stop dreaming about me, you slow-witted rectal belch! Oh, what fun it is to splash about in the fountain!  Go on, then. Try and jump on my back! Mr. Pip?  Joe, the blacksmith? I'm a lawyer from London in search of a young lad named Pip. Mr. Blacksmith, I've been sent here to offer you a reasonable sum of money in exchange for your apprentice.  I have a client who wishes to give this bright child a future. Anything he desires.  Do you still object? He will one day inherit a handsome property. But the owner of that property wants him first to travel to London and learn to be a gentleman. There's only one condition, Pip. Your benefactor wishes to remain anonymous. OH OH! If you have any suspicion of who that person might be, you are to keep it in your own breast. Understood? Then you will go to London in a week's time.  Here's 20 sterling. Well, blacksmith, you look stunned. Then I should take my leave.  You shall stay here with your roommate, Mr. Pocket. He is a distinguished young lad who will help you on your way to being a gentleman. I trust you see no problem with this? I should think not.  On up, then, and prepare for school on the morrow. Pray, come in!  As do you. Perhaps we've seen each other before. As to our lodging, it's not by any means splendid. This is our sitting room - just chairs and tables and carpet and so forth.  Oh, what a gay time we shall have, and I do mean gay as in festive, not as in penetration of the bum. Oh, but dear me! I beg your pardon! You're holding your bags all this time! Pray, let me take them!  I'm quite ashamed! Why, yes of course! You're the prowling little boy! Boy, what a smashing coincidence! That old biddy? Oh, I assure you, I have nothing to do with her anymore. She's absolutely mad! Well, don't you know about Ms. Havisham's melancholy past? Dear me, it's quite a story, and should be discussed over dinner. Come!  Right, time for a smashing meal and the story of Ms. Havisham. You'll do fine, dear fellow, just fine. Now on to Ms. Havisham: She was raised by a wealthy father and grew up to be a somewhat of a spoiled brat.  And now I might mention, Pip, that in London it is not the custom to put the knife in the mouth. , to remark that a dinner napkin should never be placed into the tumbler.  And I break from the tale now only to mention that one should never pass gas at the dinner table! Not at all, I'm sure. So the groom never showed. He simply wrote a letter, a letter that Ms. Havisham received 20 minutes before the wedding. But afterward she laid waste to the entire house, as you have seen it, and has never since looked upon the light of day. And the story ends, Pip, with me suggesting that one should never pull out the wee wee and check it for scabs whilst at the table.  Not at all, I'm sure!  Joe found you lying face down in the street, Mr. Pip, You were in such a state. You've been unconscious here for nearly three hours. I tried to tell you, Pip. She's a vengeful, spiteful woman, who wanted nothing more than to see you hurt along with the rest of the male sex. Righto. Pip. Righto. Dear God, Pip, look!  Righto, Pip.  Hello, gentlemen. Oh, whatever you do, please do not cry. Havisham's device fuels itself on your tears, I'm afraid. Yes, but just think about... panda bears!  What silly little noses they have!   Oh what fun it is to collect stamps! Lick the backs, put them into books all neat and tidy with those smashing little pictures and bright colors. Right, let's not talk about stamp-collecting, then. Let's talk about...  Oh what fun ice-skating is!  Who can catch me? Who can catch the ice-skating king? That's me. Please, sirs, you must not cry! Philip, it's too late!! Ooooo, top smart, Pip!  Oh, I'm so glad everything has worked out.  Where are all my little bunnies that you borrowed then, Pip?  Hey, Estella, let's get out of here. Hey, wait a second. You mean that this whole thing was just a setup by your mom? What the hell??   Estella, help me! I'm your boyfriend!  I'll rip off your arms and shove 'em up your arse! We were all Estella's boyfriends at one time or another. Now we're doomed. Ice-skating! AAAAAAA!!! Woohoo. Howdy there. I'm one of the weight counselors here. This must be Eric Cartman. Oh, we'll change that.  Hello, camper. My name is Rick. How are you doing?  My mom says I ain't to eat no candy here. I'm s'psoed to lose weight. Right. Yeah!  Heh! It was a lady in a costume! Heh-I can't help it. I'd give anything. Any amount of money for some candy.  Raaarrrr!!!  I'm gonna take over your body and make you slow!  Oh no! Exercise and proper diet have killed me.  AAAAA! Waugh.  Looks like we had some attempted escapees again tonight.  There ''is'' no escape.  All beddy-byes for the night, are they? We'll just have to give them more time. They'll do it! They'll do it!!  Please, Mr. Sanders.  Horace's parents want to take him home. Please, sir, if you give us one more week,... We're in trouble, Rick. Good-bye, Alice. Oh no, not you. You're not welcome here anymore.  Are you going to eat your soybean pudding? I have some Fudge 'Ems up my ass. You want some?  Me neither. I have to have sugar or I'm going to ''die.''  Two donuts and a pack of licorice, please.  Aw, damnit! Hey, dudes! I feel awesome! You know, Kyle? There was a time when your fat jokes would have gotten to me. But now I'm totally slim and totally happy! In fact, I'd say I'm  Heh heh. Just kidding, Kyle. No. Actually, I found a diet that totally works. God-damnit, all ''I'' got was a little golf clap! This is ridiculous!   Lunchtime! I'm starved! That's me.  Oh, there you are. Alright, I got the goods. Some candy bars, a few donuts, and some beef gravy. Nobody. Your mom even thinks I'm a skinny you. Uh uh. One thing. I want a bigger cut. I'm the one risking my ass, running around in that stupid town pretending to be you and collecting all the food to bring up here! All you have to do is sit back and sell it to all the fat kids! Twenty. Fine! Then I shall bid you good day!  This is so juvenile.  Eh, nothing. Hey, can I have some of that licorice to- take home? You know, maybe we've all learned something here. I mean, we set Kenny up to further and further himself each time, havin' to always outdo himself. Now he's in jail for being a whore. And perhaps, just perhaps, we are to blame.  Uh oh. <poem><i>Prostitutes! Prostitutes! They-</i></poem>  You guys! You have to check this tape out! No, dude, check this out! It's a video: this kid, he does all kinds of crazy stuff.  Oh, gro-hoss  Ey, we're trying to study. Finals are tomorrow. That's awesome!  Hey guys! Check this out! Whoa!  Sick!   I'd, I do?  It's time for me to be responsible for my own actions! Mom, Dad, we've been eating candy this whole time! Eric Cartman's been sneaking in junk food! Alright, so we're back talkin' to three competing celebrities: Tom Green, Johnny Knoxville from MTV's ''Jackass'' and Krazy Kenny. Krazy Kenny is here to promote his Pay-Per-View special this week, where he will crawl up into a bus driver's uterus and stay there for six hours. Now, some people that all you guys do is perform sick and disgusting acts for shock value and money, which makes you whores. But I'd like to prove them wrong. So what I'm gonna do... is I'm gonna offer each of you $50,000 to give me oral sex right now. Oh. Ooh, the kid says he'll do it for ten bucks. Alright, let's get going, then. Can we cut the cameras? Hey, Howard. I'm in. Fine! I'll do it for 40!  20! Damnit. I'm out.  Wow! Me too. 30. Me too. I guess he ''is'' the biggest whore.  Woo-aagh.  Woo-ugh.   Yeah. And down to the ground.  No! I have had it! Look at what you've done to my boy! You told Horace that ''he'' was responsible for his weight! You made him believe that with exercise and proper diet, he could be thin! When ''we'' told you it was his genetics! Look at these kids! They're not getting any thinner!  Your camp is a fraud! You need to accept the fact that ''most'' fat people are just genetically fat! Your time is up! And I'm going to call all the other parents to tell them to come claim ''their'' kids as well! Your camp is a WASTE ...of time! What?!  Well, what the heck. Maybe when you're all done you can teach ''me'' a thing or two, huh son?  Yeah, your time is up! But, Dad, I... ...Nothin'.  No, he's right. The counselors've been doing a good job. We've just been cheating. I believe I can lose the weight with exercise and proper diet. I don't wanna make excuses no more. If you take us back, we promise we won't cheat.  No way! I'm not doing this! But this isn't fair! (But I'm gonna starve to death if I get in there!) We'll be wanting our refund, naturally. Good-bye. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah.  ¡¡Llamen a todos junto!!  You do have the right to remain silent, ma'am. I suggest you use that right. Oh, now you care?! They're going to live with their grandmother.   The following hot presentation is for mature audiences only.  Nah nah nanah nah!   What do you want from us?? Mark, I don't like this.  What is it?! Acid?! Oh God! Are you blind?! Mark? Mark, look.  What- what do you want?  Mark, I'm scared! Oh God, Mark! Help!  You're the mayor? What the hell is gong on here?! Where are your parents?! Look, just point us to a phone, kid, alright? Mark, are we doing the right thing? I just don't know if you're dealing with these kids the right way.  Hey, I think you'd make a great father. My God! Mark!  What is it?? The bastards. Oh, Mark, let's get out of here. Na-a-ah!  Mark! Uh, how did this all happen? Why do you children live in this town alone? But what about before that? Yes!! Mark, I'm scared.  Oh God, God, please just let us out of this place.   Uh, uh... Mmrrhhhh! Rrrmm-mmrrhh! Be careful, Mark. They'll make you disappear with the M word. Hey. Looks like you're not so bad with kids after all. Yeah, right. After all this, I'm getting my tubes ties tomorrow!   Hey, kids. And I got my tubes tied. Spitwads!  It's gonna be about three days.  SpitBall! Enough, enough!  Just think about somethin' else. Think about clouds and beaches. Don't think about his supple, soft little body. Fight your urges, Mr. Broflovski! I can't help you if you won't admit you need help!! Now sit down!  Look at this young man. Just look. Don't rape. Fight it. Fight it! Okay, so what are some other things that we can do ''besides'' molest our children? Sure, "see a movie"'s good.  We could see a movie instead of molesting our children. What else? Uh huh. I'll put ah, "knitting, sewing."  Who's got another one? Nonono, we're looking for things to do ''besides'' molesting our children. Fishing's good. Uh huh.   Molest children? Oh. Fishing?  Hoowwddyy ho!  Oh, no I'm fine, Kyle. I know, Kyle. I've just been awfully busy with my family.  Honey! Boys, I want you to meet my wife. Autumn. They're too young to drink, honey. Come. You have to meet the little nuggets, too. Kids!  This is our son, Cornwallis. Our daughter Amber. And our son, Simon.  Simon's not so smart. He was born with a peanut in his head. Nothin', Simon. It sure has been tough. Nobody seems that into Christmas out there. Well don't worry kids! I'm sending the nuggets up tomorrow to spread Christmas cheer!  And if you want, you can help them. Honey, pleh, you're- you're drunk. Onkay? Honey, can we go inside for a second?  Well, it's decided, kids. Tomorrow we're gonna bring back the spirit of Christmas! Now you put that vase down!

My family and I are here to get the drive-in ready for the biig movie.  Uh-uh, honey, please don't start! They're not real, you know. Oh, big secret! Everyone can tell they're made of silicorn! Okay! Boy, oh boy, this place suuure needs a lot of work. Good job, Amber. Now this place is starting to look Christmasy    It's completely destroyed! There's nothin' I can do! Boys, I uh, I'm s-, I'm sorry. It's my fault. All my fault. I got everyone's hopes up. Aw, it's too late for that, son. everyone' gone home. And I don't know nothin' about projectors. I'm just a stupid piece of crap. Aw, that was just a stupid song, Cornwallis! I was jus' tryin' to get you to stop your bitchin' Son...  No, you did it, boys! Howdy-hey kids!  Would you like a drink? Hey haa, it's Christmas! "Hic" Weh-hell, it's a Christmas party! Hey! You boys! You boys wanna bet me I won't take off my clothes? But it's a ''Christ''mas party! That's not the only thing we gotta get workin' again,  if you know what I mean...  Come on, it's time to sit around the tree! God-damnit it's Christmas and we're gonna be a happy family around the tree! That's not the only thing that can't get up around here.   You wanna bet me I won't take off my clothes and run naked through this parkin' lot? I didn't start it! He was looking at my ''breasts!'' Don't you say that!   Aw, hell, we ''all'' did it!  I don't want to, Dad. I'm too sad. It's not that, father. Its... Well, I don't feel like I'm really a part of Christmas. Why? We're just pieces of crap. Christmas isn't for us. I see the Nativity. There's angels, shepherds and sheep. But no poo. All the Christmas movies: Santa, elves, reindeer. No poo. I'm not a part of it. I'm nothing but crap! But how can I be that giraffe and blade of grass, and a human? I don't control what they do. <poem><i>Yeah</i></poem> <poem><i>So I'm the leg of a leopard and the wings of a hen</i></poem> We can fix it up, Dad. But Dad, we can fix the projector. Dad, you taught me an important lesson: That crap is the cycle of everything. No, it wasn't a stupid song. Because you showed me that I have the power and the strength to do anything I want. You made me believe in myself, Dad! Now I'm asking you to do the same.  What's the matter, Cornwallis? Oh, look! A homeless person.  There. That's better. Mom! They got it working! Eee, hey! Hnhn. Eehhhh, pretty!  Heh What? Dad? Huh?   And in other news tonight it appears that everyone is officially SICK OF CHRISTMAS!  Well, the holiday spirit may be gone from South Park, but at least our faith in each other remains strong. Oh really? Good Grief! We need a Christmas tree for our play.  Alright, everyone, we've got to get on with our play! Mayor, some adorable children are here to see you. Okay!  Okay, talk directly in the mike and don't hit any hard p's. Uumm, okay, sound is speeding, and...  Hold on. Uh,   Dude, that was awesome. The script. It's sweet. Well, it ''should'' be in the script. All that "you're fat" and "you're a Jew" and stuff. It's great.  Rolling... I bring happiness and love to children all over the world. Christmas is for giving! ...Presents.
