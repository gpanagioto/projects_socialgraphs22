 Can we just drop this, please? I don't wanna talk about it! No, he's not.  Is he? I just need to explain things.  Hey Token. Look, I don't know if you saw Wheel of Fortune last night, but- Listen, Token, my dad isn't a racist. He's just stupid, all right? He just blurted out the N-word, and it's no big deal, okay? Token, my dad wasn't trying to be offensive. Just forget about it. Yeah, but he didn't say it in anger or anything like that. Hey Token. I just wanted to let you know that everything is cool now. My dad apologized to Jesse Jackson. Well, yeah. Dude, Jesse Jackson said it's okay!  He told my dad he was... Token! Hey, wait up.  I just wanted to say, I get it now. You know, after that "little person" talk at that assembly the other day, I understand how you feel about somebody saying the N word. God dammit! Now look, Token, I've done everything I can to make this right! You have no reason to still be mad! I'm not responsible for what my dad did! What the hell do you want from me?!  Then stop being mad! What was his point? Dude, I don't get it.  Wait a minute. That's it! I don't get it. Don't you see, Kyle? I don't get it!  Token, I get it now. I don't get it. I've been trying to say that I understand how you feel, but, I'll never understand. I'll never really get how it feels for a black person to have somebody use the N word. I don't get it.  Yeah. I totally don't get it.
