O-hoo no Butters! You got an advance two days ago.   Girlfriend? Don't worry, Butters. We just wanna say hi and then we'll leave you two alone.  You see? I told you he wouldn't turn out gay. I, don't know. Oh boy, I think I know what's happened. Our son hasn't learned yet that girls will pretend to like him for money. Uh, Butters, can we have a little talk with you? Outside? You see, Butters, women know that they can make men do anything by flirting. And some girls, like these, turn that into a profession.
