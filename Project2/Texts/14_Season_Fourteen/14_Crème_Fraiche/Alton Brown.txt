Now just look at this pork tenderloin. It is brined and ready for action. We're gonna take a stick of butter and just smear that all over. Now let's get that on the grill. Look at the char we're getting. That, that is what we're going for. Just look at the glaze we've got going now on that thing. Alright now, here's the really cool part. What we're gonna do is- A culinary battle royale is set to explode here in a school cafeteria. Will it be the simple, rustic cafeteria food of the challenger, or will the Iron Chef reign supreme? And our celebrity sous-chefs, Mario Batali, Paula Deen , and Giada De Laurentiis with her perky tats and gigantic head.  These kids have now been waiting over twelve hours for their lunch. Over at the prep station Jamie Oliver is crying again. The challenger has left the cafeteria to find his most important ingredient.
