Hey– Hey, John, I got some bad news. We just lost another client to the South Park Realty Group. We're losing people like crazy! These guys are ruthless.  I don't know he's gotta be using some kind of soft filter– nothing I've ever seen! I think maybe real estate just isn't the same anymore. Maybe we gotta start making fancy videos to keep up. They're showing a house... The Tolkien house... you have to stop them.
