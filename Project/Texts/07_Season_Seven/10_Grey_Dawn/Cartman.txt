 Oh God, memorial services are sooo boring. Yeah, but like, eight of them were hippies. Mostly hippies go to farmer's markets. Mostly. , proving once and for all that Jews cannot play hockey! I'm not fat. I just have a sweet hockey body. Looks like Stan's dad's been hittin' the bottle again.  Calm down! We cannot understand you!  Old people! Oh God, they're coming!  They're not gonna stop until we're all dead! Ooooh, isn't this great you guys? Being able to walk the streets now that old people are confined to their homes where they belong? My God, he's right.  Except for you, Kyle. I believe that's us... thank God.  More old people! Old people gone mad! So our only solution is to cut off their life force. No. But we can sneak into town and shut down their food supply.  Here. Yeah. You take out Country Kitchen Buffet, and old people won't know what to do. Is it? Two years ago they closed the Country Kitchen Buffet in Steamboat Springs. And all the old people died of starvation in less than a week. I think I have a plan, though we'll have to do it tonight. We'll start by sneaking into town, cleverly disguised as black people. [''they appear from the sides of buildings dressed in black and then gather in front of one of them''] At 5:45 Kenny and Kyle split off and set a diversion on the east end of town.  and steal some of the explosives the old people have stashed. Nine o'clock: we rendezvous at the Country Kitchen Buffet, where we strap the explosives and the timer to Kyle's chest. We say our tearful goodbyes to Kyle, and then we send him inside. Yeah! Aw yeah! Well, right, or we could always do that.
