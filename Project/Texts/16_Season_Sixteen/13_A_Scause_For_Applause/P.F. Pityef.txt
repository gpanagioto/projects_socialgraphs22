Welcome, welcome, to the P.F. Pityef Bracelet Factory. How can I be of service? Ah, I see you're wearing one of our brown scauses already. Delightful. What color would you like your new scause to be? Well of course! You came for a scause to wear on your paws. And you want others to wear yours upon thaurs. One at a time, please. One at a time. Not a problem, you can return your scause and for just five dollars I'll give you two more! Absolutely! Five dollars please. Oh my, it's the sound! Of all sounds in all sounddom this one's most profound.  My work here is done, and just look at you now! You're all covered in scauses from your hoof to your brow. Enjoy all your scauses. You look great in your cause. Be sure to give each other lots of applause. I'm off to the next town in my little truck. Have a nice day! Toot a loo! No please! Please show mercy!
