Dude, you've got ''herpes'' on your ''face!'' Ow! Yeah, it's pretty weird. We're here to have a slumber party with Kenny. Catch what? Sshh! Cartman! Whoa, dude! ''You've'' got herpes on your face, too! Huh? Dude, I think I just saw a ''rat!'' I don't think it's very healthy to sleep with rats. Oh.  Goody? What do you mean, "goody"?! Chickenpo--? Oh no, I must have caught it from Kenny last night. Well, you sure seem happy about it! Okay. Well at least I'm not gonna die from it like ''you'' might! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! I don't wanna watch this! I wanna watch ''Terrance and Phillip''! Well I've got the remote, ''bitch!'' Hahaha.  No way, dude! We're gonna watch Terrance and Phillip ''all'' day-- Ey! Get me out of here! Homework?! But I'm in the hospital! That son of a bitch! What kind of sick weirdo is he? Not Mr. Garrison, Ma. He really is a sick weirdo. Wait! Where are you going? Milkshakes?! Weak! And so that's why ''Knight Rider'' was the best show in America.  Sshh. Wake her up and we're ''both dead''. Yeah. What are you talking about? They did? Why?  Of course! Cartman, our parents sent us over there to catch chickenpox from Kenny! It's some kind of parental conspiracy. Our parents are trying to ''kill us'' or something. How does someone ''get'' herpes? But what if we ''want'' to give somebody herpes? My dad has five dollars on top of his dresser.  And have Shelly kick my ass? No thanks. Plus, I have to get my parents back just as much as you do. Thanks a lot, Frida!  I don't ''wanna'' go back there. Don't you guys feel like brushing your teeth first? You know, freshen up your breath. Pretty good. Wow, coo-hul! We got you back for getting ''us'' sick. We had a prostitute use your toothbrushes and stuff. Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
