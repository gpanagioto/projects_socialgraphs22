We are joined this morning by the Disney supergroup the Jonas Brothers. Hello boys.  Now, tell us what you're doin' here in Denver, guys. Now, guys, a lot has been made about your "purity rings". Can you tell us about those? That's wonderful, boys.  It's good that little girls can see a concert and not have it be about sex. We understand that at the concert tonight you'll be dousing girls in the audience with white foam. Is that correct? Well can you give our audience a peek?  That's great stuff, boys. You like takin' the Jonas Brothers' hot foam in your faces, girls?
