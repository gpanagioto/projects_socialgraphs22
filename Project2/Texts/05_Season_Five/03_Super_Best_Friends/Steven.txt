Oh yes, you see, David Blaine is much more than a magician. He's a scholar, a visionary, a leader. Oh, I've got a trick for you to learn: I can show you how to make your true self appear. Let me ask you all something: Do you consider yourselves to be happy? ...Right, yeh. Eh, see, the reason that you are unha- Wait, the.. the ''point'' is... that you ''can'' be happy. You see, your friends and parents have programmed you in a way that makes you feel isolated and alone. How many times have you felt like nobody knows the real... you?  You're not really happy. Your potential hasn't even been reached.  If you look through David Blaine's incredible book, you'll find a lot of life's answers. Let's read some of the book together, shall we? That's right. Congratulations, young Blaintologists. From this day, you are clean.  Now, we have very important work to do! David Blaine is going to put on a big magic show in Denver tomorrow night, where he's going to eat his own head. So it's up to all you new Blaintologists to get as many people there as you can. Whoever gets the most people to come gets a prize!   Everyone! Everyone, gather 'round! I have great news for all Blaintologists, and for our new members as well. We've just gotten word from Mr. Blaine himself: The government has denied our church's request for tax-exempt status! Be-cause! Mr. Blaine has arranged for all Blaintologists members from every city and state to march into Washington and de''mand'' our right for tax-exempt status by committing a mass suicide! Mr. Blaine has said that by killing ourselves in Washington, we are guaranteed everlasting happiness in the afterlife! Get your things ready. We leave for Washington at dawn! Alright, brothers and sisters, gather around.  Our leader, he... he's ''leaving'' us!
