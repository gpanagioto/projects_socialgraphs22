You don't suck at football, Butters, you suck at all sports. The school said they're the most dangerous plays, so they don't have us do 'em anymore. Dad, do we really have to wear bras? This game is stupid. I have no idea how to go out on the field and be as nice as I can to the other team! Look, I'm sorry guys, my dad said he's too busy with the Broncos. He doesn't have time for us.  I'm sorry. My dad is taking professional sarcastaball really seriously.  The guys are right. From now on, you're team captain, Butters. You lead us to victory. Not at this you don't! What about that creamy filling you talked about? That gooey goodness inside you that makes you the butteriest Butters we know? Cartman, you idiot! Dad? What? Whoa, whoa, you can't, you can't tell me what to do! Oh, right, like he doesn't exaggerate every disease he gets! We're not being sarcastic, Dad! Is it so hard to believe that we really enjoy a sport that has no violence? Is it so hard for you to believe that when Butters says "Competitiveness can be compassionate," he's being completely sincere? Yeah Dad. You need some of this.
