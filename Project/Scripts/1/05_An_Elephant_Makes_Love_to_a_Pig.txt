Bus Stop.

Cartman

Hey Stan, where'd you get that black eye?

Stan

Nothing, I mu-I mean, nowhere.

Cartman

Your sister beat you up again, huh?

Stan

No!

Cartman

Eheh, you know, heh, your sister kicked your ass.

Stan

She's just pissed off 'cause she got headgear at the dentist. She's taking it out on me.

Kyle

Yeah, but that sucks, to get your butt kicked by a girl, Stan.

Cartman

I would never let a woman kick my ass. If she tried anything, I'd be like, "hey, you get your bitch ass back in the kitchen, and make me some pie!"

Stan

My parents don't even believe that she beats me up. They think she's all innocent and sweet, but I know that she's an evil bitch!

Cartman

Be a man Stan. Just say, "Hey woman, ye-you shut your mouth and make babies."

Stan

Hey Kyle, what's that elephant doing?

-----


The camera pulls back to get the elephant in the picture.

Kyle

You mean this one?

Stan

Yeah.

Kyle

He's my new pet elephant.

Stan

Whoa dude! Where'd you get a pet elephant?

Kyle

I got it mail ordered from Africa. The ad said it would take 4 to 6 weeks, but it only took three.

Stan

Wow, that's cool!

Kyle

No it's not cool! My mom won't let me keep him in the house. She says he's too big, and that his poop is bigger than our couch.

Cartman

That's why my mom got me a pot-bellied pig. Cause its poop is small.

Kenny

(Hey you guys, I talked to Garrison and he told me that they're almost the same.)

Stan

Well yeah, but pigs aren't smart, like elephants.

-----


Ms. Crabtree's bus arrives.

Ms. Crabtree

Hey. Wait a minute. What is that thing?

Kyle

Uh, oh, this, this is, the new retarded kid.

Ms. Crabtree

Oh—I'm sorry little girl. But you still can't get on. You have to take the special ed bus.

-----


Shot of retarded kid bus. Retarded noises of protest are heard.

Kyle

Boy, it looks like you're not welcome anywhere elephant. See ya.

-----


He enters the bus with Stan and Kenny.

Cartman

[Entering.] If a woman ever gave me crap, I'd say, "Hey, you go do my laundry and-"

Ms. Crabtree

SIT DOWN KID!!!

Cartman

[Stung.] Yes ma'am.

-----


Mr. Garrison's Classroom.

Mr. Garrison

And now children, our friend Mr. Hat is going to tell us all about genetic engineering.

Mr. Hat

That's right Mr. Garrison, genetic engineering is an exciting new science. You can splice the DNA from some animals, and make them better.

Kyle

Mr. Garrison?

Mr. Garrison

Yes Kyle.

Kyle

With genetic engineering, can you make an elephant smaller?

Mr. Garrison

Well, uh, ye, yes, I suppose you could. You could, splice elephant genes with a dog, or cat, or a, pot-bellied pig genes.

Kyle

That's it. I'm going to combine my elephant with a pot-bellied pig and make...pot-bellied elephants.

-----


The class gasps.

Kyle

They'd be smart like elephants, but small like pigs.

Stan

That'd be cool!

Bebe

I want a pot-bellied elephant.

Pip

Yes, I'll pay fifty dollars for one.

Terrance Mephesto

That's stupid.

Kyle

Shut up Terrance, we can geneti-cal engineer anything we want.

Terrance

Oh yeah, I bet I can genetically clone a whole human being before you crossbreed and elephant and a pig.

Kyle

I'll bet you can't.

Terrance

Watch me plebeian.

Mr. Garrison

Well, spank my ass and call me Charlie. Isn't this exciting, two A+ students in a cloning war.

Mr. Hat

Yes Mr. Garrison, genetic engineering lets us correct God's horrible, horrible mistakes, like German people.

Mr. Garrison

You know, you boys might want to visit the Genetic Engineering Ranch outside of town for some help. And you could both use this for your science fair projects next month.

-----


The bell rings. Most of the class leaves, but the boys stay behind.

Kyle

Genetic Engineering Ranch! Sweet!

Stan

Wait, wait. We still need a pig.

Kyle

We can use Cartman's pig.

Cartman

Ehh, you leave Fluffy out of this!

Kyle

We're not gonna hurt her, we just need some of her blood.

Cartman

You're not using any of Fluffy's blood, or else I'll kick you in the nuts. Kyle, Kyle no!

-----


The boys leave.

-----


Mr. Garrison steps forward to stop Stan.

Mr. Garrison

Uh, uhuh, Stanley, can I talk to you for a minute?

Stan

Okay.

Mr. Garrison

I couldn't help but notice that black eye you have. Are there problems at home?

Stan

[Despondantly.] Yes...

Mr. Garrison

Oh dear. Here Stanley, sit down, have some cocoa, and tell your friend Mr. Hat all about it.

-----


Stan sits down.

Mr. Hat

I'm your friend, Mr. Hat, Stan. You can tell me anything. Now, who hits you, is it your father, or your mother?

Stan

Oh, neither. It's my sister.

Mr. Garrison

[Indignantly.] Your sister?! Oh for Pete's sake, don't be such a little wuss. Stop wasting Mr. Hat's time with pansy little foo-foo problems, and, give me back my cocoa!

-----


Stan's house. A TV is heard.

Jesus

Let's open the phone lines back up for some questions...

-----


Shelly turns to see Stan coming out of the sofa's shadow.

Shelly Marsh

Hey!

Robert

Yeah, is this Jesus?

Jesus

Yes, my son.

Stan

Hi Shelly.

Shelly

Are you looking at my headgear?

Stan

Headgear? What headgear?

Shelly

Are you looking at my headgear?

Stan

Oh, uh gosh uh, I didn't really notice.

-----


Shelly gets up and glowers at him.

Shelly

You little liar.

-----


She starts advancing, and Stan starts retreating.

Stan

No, I think it looks terrific. It matches your AAAAAH!

-----


Stan turns to run, but she has his arm, she proceeds to beat the living hell out of him. She tosses him down the stairs into the basement, then approaches the doorway. He climbs out, but she flips him back towards the living room, then goes for the TV and drops it on his head. After the TV shorts out, he removes it, but she throws him like a basketball out the window, where his friends are waiting.

Kyle

Ready to go Stan?

Stan

Go where?

Kyle

To the Genetical Engineering Ranch.

Kyle

We got Cartman's pig so we can splice its genes with my elephant's.

Cartman

Nobody's splicin' nothing from Fluffy!

-----


From the broken window.

Shelly

I swear I'm gonna kill you Stan!

Kyle

Why's your sister so mean to you dude?

Cartman

Yeah, if some sissy chick tried to kick my ass, I'd be all like, "Hey, listen, missy, eh, yewhy don't you go knit me sweater before I slap you in the face!"

-----


She appears at the broken window.

Shelly

Who said that?

-----


All stay quiet. Cartman points to Kenny.

-----


South Park Engineering Ranch, night. The boys approach the entrance.

Kyle

This must be it.

-----


Lightning strikes the ranch.

Cartman

[A bit wary.] Well, looks like nobody's home. Guess we should come back some other time.

Kyle

No, Cartman, we're going in there and splicing Fluffy and my elephant together.

Cartman

It's okay Fluffy, I won't let them hurt you.

Kyle

It's just a stupid pig.

Stan

Yeah, quit being such a baby.

Cartman

Baby?! Well, at least I don't get my ass kicked by a girl!

Stan

At least I'm not a little pig-fucker!

Cartman

Hey! I'm taking my pig and...Screw you guys! I'm going home! This whole idea's stupid anyway.

Kyle

What the hell would you know you fat sweaty mongoloid, you never get higher than a 'D'!

Cartman

Hey! Why don't you go back to San Francisco with the rest of the Jews?!

Kyle

There's no Jews in San Francisco, you retard!

Cartman

I'll kick you in the nuts!

Dr. Alphonse Mephesto

Can I help you?

-----


The boys all gasp, and Kenny pulls his hood closed.

Kenny

Mmmmmm!

Kyle

Uh... yeah... we want to crossbreed an elephant with a pig.

Mephesto

Brilliant idea, huge elephant-sized pigs.

Kyle

No, no, no. We want to make little pot-bellied elephants that people can keep in their houses as pets.

Mephesto

Ohh, that's an even better idea. Come on in.

-----


Inside the South Park Genetic Engineering Ranch.

Mephesto

I'm so pleased that you children are interested in genetic engineering.

Cartman

Eh, it's okay Fluffy, nobody's going to hurt you.

Mephesto

It's thanks to the wonders of genetic engineering that soon there will be an end to hunger, disease, pollution, even war. I have created things that will change the world for the better. For instance, here is a monkey with four asses.

Monkey

Mhhh.

Kyle

How does that make the world better?

Mephesto

And here, of course, is my four assed ostrich. And my four assed mongoose.

Stan

Do you have anything besides just animals with four asses?

Mephesto

Oh, uh, I suppose so uh. Oh yes, over here. Here I have rats splice with ducks, and gorillas spliced with mosquitos, and here I have rabbits spliced with fish to make little bunnyfish.

Cartman

Heyyy, these bunny ears are tied on with little strings.

Mephesto

And over here, Swiss cheese spliced with chalk, and a beard.

Kyle

Well, what about our pot-bellied elephant?

Mephesto

Oh. Well I'm sorry children, but, pig and elephant DNA just won't splice. Haven't you ever heard that song by 'Loverboy'?

Kyle

Which song is that?

Mephesto


Diindoon - pig and elephant DNA just won't splice!


Although, maybe I could help you add a few asses to that swine of yours.


Cartman

You can keep your hands off of Fluffy's ass!

Mephesto

You know, it's amazing what we can do with a little blood sample these days.

-----


Mephesto pricks Stan with the syringe.

Stan

Ow!

Mephesto

Hmm? What? Oh, excuse me.

Kyle

Wait, what are you taking Stan's blood for?

Mephesto

Oh, pardon me, I tripped. Could I have some hair please?

Kyle

Watch out Stan! Genetic engineers are crazy.

-----


The boys quickly move away.

Cartman

Come on Fluffy!

-----


Fluffy Squeals.

-----


Inside the Cafeteria.

Jewish Kid

This fish is just hurting my anus.

Jason

Naw, it's pretty fresh.

Cartman

UUuuhh. I sure am hungry.

Pip

'Ello gentlemen, any of you blokes know what's for lunch today?

-----


Silence. The boys stare back.

Pip

Lunchy munchies, hmmm?

Cartman

Go away, Pip! Nobody likes you!

Stan

Yeah, what kind of name is Pip anyway?!

Pip

Well, my father's family name being Pirrip, and my Christian name being Phillip, my infant tongue...

Cartman

God Damnit, would you shut the hell up?! Nobody gives a rat's ass.

Stan

Yeah! Go away, Pip!

Pip

Righto.

-----


Pip walks off.

Cartman

Gah, French people piss me off.

-----


Terrance, Bill, & Fosse Approach.

Terrance

Hey dumb-asses. You morons give up on your stupid science fair project yet?

Kyle

No! We're already halfway done.

Terrance

Halfway? Then all you've got is a stupid pig.

Bill

Yeah, it's probably a gay pig too.

Fosse

Stupid gay pig.

Kyle

It's more than you've got!

Terrance

Wroong. We've already got our human clone well under way.

-----


One of the bullies opens a bag and drops it. A foot pops out.

Kyle

Oh my God! They cloned a foot.

-----


The foot kicks Cartman in the face.

Cartman

Ugh!... Hey! I'll kick your ass!

-----


Cartman kicks it away, and it lands in Pip's lunch tray and bounces away.

Pip

Eho!

Terrance

By Friday, we're gonna clone a whole human being. Good luck with your stupid little pig.

-----


In the kitchen

Chef

Hello there children.

Kyle

Hey Chef.

Chef

How you doin'?

Boys

Bad.

Chef

Why bad?

Kyle

We need to genetically engineer our pig and an elephant, but their genes won't splice.

Chef

Ahhhh, of course they won't splice children. Haven't you ever heard that song by 'Loverboy'?

Chef


Dooodnnndoodnn - A pig and an elephant DNA just won't...


A pig-elephant. Say, now that's not a bad idea.


Kyle

I told you guys.

Chef

Imagine, a pint sized elephant that you could keep in the house. Children, we could make a fortune with this.

Kyle

You hear that dudes? We'll be rich!

Chef

Forget about all that genetic engineering whoosafudge. If you want to combine a pig and an elephant, just get them to make sweeet love.

Cartman

Whaaat?!

Stan

I don't think an elephant would make love to a pig.

Cartman

I don't think my pig would want to make love to that stupid elephant.

Chef

Sure they would. But you're gonna have to get 'em in the mood.

Stan

So how do we do that?

Chef

Do what I do, get 'em goood and drunk.

-----


Boys get off the bus later that day.

Stan

Hey uh, you guys want to come over to my house?

Kyle

We've got work to do Stan, I think it takes a while for an elephant to get drunk.

Stan

Really, you, you guys don't want to come over for just a little bit?

Cartman

Why? Is your sister gonna kick your ass again?

Stan

Shut up Cartman!

Kenny

(Or are you gonna hit her with your hand?)

Kyle

Yeah Stan, she's just a girl.

Cartman

Yeah, if some girl tried to kick my ass, I'd be like, "hey, why don't you stop dressin' me up like a mailman, annnd making me dance for you while you go and smoke crack in your bedroom and have sex with some guy I don't even know, on my dad's bed!"

-----


Astonished looks from the other guys.

Stan

Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?!

Cartman

I'm just saying you're just a little wuss, that's all.

Kyle

Stan, you can use family love as a weapon against Shelly. The next time she's gonna kick your ass, just tell her, "Shelly, you're my sister, and I love you."

Kenny

("And I want to see you handling your breasts.")

Stan

Sick dude, she's my sister.

Kyle

Try it. We'll see you in a while, we got to go get Cartman's pig.

Cartman

No, you don't gotta get Cartman's pig! You leave Fluffy out of this!

Kyle

Come on Kenny.

Cartman

Kyle no, seriously. No fuckin' elephant is going to make love to my Fluffy, I... Kyle, I will kick you in the nnnnuts.

Stan

Crap.

-----


Stan's house. Stan sneaks through the front door.

TV Voice

And now back to Jesus and Pals on South Park Public Access...

Shelly

Are you staring at my neck-brace?

Stan

No, I mean, yes, I mean, what neck-brace?

-----


She jumps off the sofa and grabs him by the throat.

Stan

Shelly, before you beat my face into a bloody pulp again, I just want you to know that... that you're my sister, and I love you.

-----


Shelly smiles, Stan smiles, it looks like she's gonna let him go... yeah, right! She throws him off to a clear space on the floor, where he lies defeated.

Stan

No. Ahh! Someday, Shelly, I'm gonna be bigger than you, and you're gonna wish you'd never done any of this to me.

Shelly

You'll never be bigger than me Stan. Never!

-----


Inside the South Park Genetic Engineering Ranch.

-----


Mephesto is marveling at his creation.

Mephesto

Beautiful, it's absolutely beautiful. My son, I think we've finally done it.

-----


A fetal version of Stan is seen in the incubator.

Terrance

Yes, we have dad. My very own human clone.

Bill

Hopefully not a gay clone.

Fosse

Yeah, that was stupid.

Bill

Stupid.

Fosse

That was stupid.

-----


Out in the hills somewhere, Kyle is pumping a keg that the elephant is drinking from.

Kyle

Come on elephant, keep drinking.

Stan

Damn, I wonder how drunk he needs to be to make sweet love to the pig.

-----


Fluffy is drinking from a trough labeled "Beer".

Kyle

Dammit! This is never gonna work.

-----


Chef comes into view.

Chef

Hello children. I thought I'd check and see how our little entrepreneurial venture is going.

Kyle

Rotten, they're both really drunk, but the won't have sex.

Chef

Ohh, children, you just can't stick a drunk pig with a drunk elephant, and, and, expect them to do the mattress mambo. You need to set the mood.

-----


He moves over to a boombox with a mic attached.

Chef

Let me show you boys what I'm talking about.

Tonight is a-right for love,
you know I -- want tuh touch you where the lights don't go.
Tonight is a-right for love, love gravy.
Expressing love so sweet.
I want tuh -- keep you burnin' like a dog in heat.
Tonight is a-right for love, love graaavaaay.



-----


The elephant and pig approach each other. Fluffy smiles at the elephant, then turns around in order to receive him.

Chef

Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Elton John!

-----


Enter Elton John. Intermingled shots of Fluffy and elephant getting interested.

Elton John


Oooo tonight
Oooo it's all right
Oooo tonight is right for love, love gravy.



-----


The boys applaud

Chef

Thank you Elton.

-----


slowing the tempo. Houses all over the hill show couples embracing.

Chef


Tonight is right for love, love graaavaaaaaay.



-----


Elephant is about to mount Fluffy.

Kyle

Hey look! It's working.

Chef

Now children, gather around, and watch the wonders of life. The beauty of Mother Nature.

-----


Squish. Squeals follow.

Kyle

Aah!

Stan

Sick!

Cartman

Fluffy!

Chef

Hmm, now I know how all those white women must have felt.

-----


Squealing continues.

-----


Inside the South Park Genetic Engineering Ranch. A big mutant version of Stan is in the incubator, with a very long left arm.

Mephesto

How luscious. Our creature has come to fruition, boys.

Terrance

Dad, you're the best.

Mephesto

Oh my God! He only has one ass. He's of no use to me, I'll have to burn the room.

-----


Clone Stan breaks out of the incubator.

Mephesto

Oh no, this entire experiment is turning out very bad.

Clone Stan

Me bad??

-----


Clone Stan throws four-assed frog against wall, killing it.

Mephesto

Eeegads, he's out of control. We'll have to destroy him.

Terrance

But he's our science fair project!

Clone Stan

Uhhh, me baad, aba-ba-chewy-chomp.

Mephesto

He's too dangerous son.

Terrance

But dad! I want a human clone.

Mephesto

Son, no.

-----


Clone Stan jumps through window, then tears down the ranch gate entrance.

Mephesto

Oh son, you've made a horrible mistake. You've put all the people of South Park in jeopardy.

Terrance

They're all stupid anyway. Come on guys, let's go.

Bill

Yeahh, they're all gay.

-----


Back on the Hill. Shot of Fluffy and elephant sleeping together.

Kyle

Aren't they ever gonna wake up?

Chef

Oh, they will. It's gonna be one uuuugly sight.

Kyle

I thought you said the wonder of Mother Nature was a beautiful thing.

Stan

Yeah, when does Mother Nature go from beautiful to ugly?

Chef

Usually about 9:30 in the morning, children.

-----


The elephant begins to wake up.

Chef

Uh oh, here we go.

-----


Elephant looks down at Fluffy with surprise and bellows.

Chef

Yeahhh, there's nothing worse than getting all drunk and waking up the next morning next to a pig.

-----


Fluffy looks up at elephant, begins crying.

Chef

Or a big fat elephant.

Kyle

Hey, how do we know if she's pregnant?

Chef

Well boys, we might not know that for a couple of days.

Kyle

Couple of days? But Terrance is going to have his human clone by tomorrow.

Cartman

Well, good job Einstein, why don't we just build a rocket in the meantime?

-----


Kyle punches Cartman.

Cartman

Hey!

-----


Mephesto approaches.

Mephesto

Oh thank Buddha I found you boys. You must tell me, have you seen anything odd lately?

Stan

Uh, we saw an elephant have sex with a pig.

Mephesto

No, no, I said odd.

Chef

Hey, you're that crazy cracker from up on the hill.

Mephesto

Sir, if making mutant animals spliced with humans is crazy... then... uhhhhh... hmmm... oh, nevermind. I'm afraid there's been a bit of an incident at the ranch. You see, I've created a large mutant clone of that little boy there, and he's broken free.

Kenny

(A big mutant Stan?!)

Stan

A big mutant version of me?

Kyle

Is he bigger than a regular clone?

Mephesto

He's terribly dangerous. His brain is identical to yours. I need you to help me find him.

-----


Downtown South Park. Clone Stan is wreaking havoc on the town. People are running in fear. Clone Stan has a car in one hand, he's destroying it. A woman screams. Clone Stan tosses car aside effortlessly.

Clone Stan

Ah chewy-chewy-chomp.

Woman

Oh my Gooodd!

Mr. Garrison

Stan, are you wearing a different hat?

Clone Stan

Uhhhyahhuhhh.

-----


picks up Mr. Garrison and begins beating him against the ground

Mr. Garrison

Hey, I know a certain young man who's itching for a detention.

-----


Clone Stan throws Mr. Garrison aside.

Mr. Garrison

Aaaaaah!

-----


Mr. Garrison flies through Jimbo's Guns window.

Mr. Garrison

Ooooh.

-----


Boys in Downtown South Park.

Kyle

How big do you think he is?

Stan

I bet he weighs four hundred pounds.

Kyle

Come on Stan, don't you even know where you would go?

Kenny

(Look at that! What's he doin'?)

Stan

Oh my God!

Townsman

Aaaah!

-----


Clone Stan is running by with two people in his arms.

-----


Newscaster on TV.

Tom

It appears that the horrible, destructive creature is actually eight-year old Stan Marsh of South Park. When asked why he was wreaking so much havoc on his home town, the little boy replies simply, "Me Stan, ba-chomp, ba-chewy-chomp, ba-chewy-chomp. Back to you in the studio.

TV Newscaster

Thanks Tom, police are requesting that if you see this little eight-year old boy you immediately kill him and burn his body. That's all for now.

TV Voice

Now back to Jesus and Pals.

Jesus

 -- Yea, the way is paved with gold for ye who seek truth and-

-----


Clone Stan breaks through wall on set of show.

Clone Stan

Ba-ba-chomp-betchaba-chewy-chewy-chomp-aaah.

Jesus

Jesus!

Clone Stan

its-to-the-left-mayoueyea.

-----


On the streets of South Park. Officer Barbrady is directing traffic.

Stan

Officer Barbrady, my evil genetic clone is destroying the town. We have to find him.

Officer Barbrady

You boys have been watching the "X-Files" too much, there's no such thing as genetic clone - 

Clone Stan

Ahhhh.

-----


Clone Stan grabs Officer Barbrady and throws him into nearby pond.

Officer Barbrady

Whoa! [From under the surface.] Listen, uh, you kids go on home, there's nothing to see here.

Kyle

Come on, let's go!

-----


Stan's Uncle Jimbo approaches.

Jimbo

There you are! Stanley, you tore up my entire gun shop, you better have a good explanation for this mister!

Stan

It wasn't me Uncle Jimbo, it was my evil genetic clone.

-----


Mr. Garrison walks up looking like hell.

Mr. Garrison

Stanley, what the hell has gotten in to you?! You have got severe lunchroom duty mister!

Jimbo

I'm gonna go have a word with your father Stanley.

Mr. Garrison

Yeah, you wait 'til your father hears about this.

Kyle

Wait, Stan, there he goes.

Stan

Stop!

Clone Stan

Ahhh, ba-ba-chomp?

Kyle

He recognizes you dude.

Stan

That's good, that's good dude. Just calm down.

-----


Clone Stan is now seated in the road.

Clone Stan

Ba-chomp, eh mee ahh jaran.

Kyle

What should we do with him?

-----


Stan looks at Clone Stan, then smiles mischievously.

Stan

Stan, how would you like to go home and meet your sister?

Clone Stan

Ahhhh, yeahhh.

-----


Outside Stan's house. The boys and Clone Stan approach the front door. Sparky can be seen off to the side.

Stan

...So remember, Shelly's the one with the big wire coming out of her mouth and a metal plate on her back. When you see Shelly, kick her ass. Shelly bad, Shelly very bad.

Clone Stan

Me bad??

Stan

No! Shelly bad, you good.

-----


Clone Stan proceeds to destroy the house.

Stan

He's tearing up the house, stop him!

-----


Clone Stan is hitting a chair against the ground. Kenny runs towards Clone Stan, who uses the chair to chuck him into the microwave in the kitchen. The microwave starts up, cooking Kenny.

Stan

Come on Kyle, Cartman.

-----


The boys run at Clone Stan, and he knocks each one aside.

Clone Stan

Ah.

Shelly

What the hell do you want?

Clone Stan

Chewy-chewy-chomp.

-----


Shelly head butts him onto the ground.

Clone Stan

Ahhh. Uhhh.

-----


Mephesto rushes in followed shortly by Terrance with Bill & Fosse.

Mephesto

Boys! Boys, I'm lusciously sorry for everything.

Terrance

Hey, they've got our clone. He belongs to us.

Mephesto

No son, this beast is a disgrace to genetic engineers everywhere. Boys, I'm sorry I've caused you such - inconvenience. I tried to play God, and I failed.

-----


Mephesto shoots Clone Stan through the head.

Terrance

Daddy! Nooooo!

Mephesto

All I ever wanted was to genetically engineer something useful, but I failed. Perhaps we shouldn't be toying with God's creations. Perhaps we should just leave nature alone, to its simple one assed schematics.

Terrance

You cheating bastards. This isn't over, just wait until tomorrow.

-----


Kyle just now noticed something.

Kyle

Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastards!

-----


Stan sees his parents drive up.

Stan

Mom and dad are home. My house is a disaster, you guy- you guys have got to help me.

Cartman

I ain't helpin' crap! I want to eat some paeh.

Stan

You can't just leave me here alone.

Cartman

Oh yeah, watch me. [Zips away.]

Kyle

Yeah Stan, we have to go find out if Cartman's pig is pregnant or not. See ya. [Leaves.]

Stan

Thanks a lot.

Shelly

Ohh boy, you are gonna get it now.

-----


Jimbo and Mr. Garrison are shown outside, talking to Stan's parents.

Stan

It isn't fair! Everybody hates me! The whole town wants me killed! Mom and dad are gonna send me away! I don't want to be sent away! I want to stay here! Eehhhehehe!

-----


Randy and Sharon enter.

Randy

Stanley, what, what in God's name have you been doing?

Sharon Marsh

Everybody in town is upset with you young man. What's going on? Are you on drugs?

Shelly

It's not Stan's fault.

Randy

Huh?

Shelly

It wasn't Stan, he was... he was with me the whole time.

Randy

Oh, well Stan, we're uh, we're sorry we jumped to conclusions.

Sharon

Oh honey, please forgive us son.

Stan

Shelly, you, you saved my life. And yet, you've done so much more than that. Today you've taught me the meaning of family. Sure, families don't always get along, but when the forces of evil descend upon us, we conquer them, by sticking together.

-----


Shelly begins beating the crap out of Stan.

Stan

Uh, ahh, oooh.

-----


rats drag away Kenny's charred corpse as Shelly takes a lawnmower to Stan's face.

-----


Mr. Garrison's Class. The science projects are due.

Mr. Garrison

Everyone, let's give Casey and his weed a big hand.

-----


Only Clyde claps.

Mr. Garrison

Okay Kyle, we're ready to see your science project.

Kyle

Well, our pig hasn't given birth yet, but she should anytime now.

Mr. Garrison

Oh, well then I guess you get an 'F'. Okay, Terrance, I know the class can hardly wait to see your science fair project.

Terrance

Thank you Mr. Garrison. Boys, Mr. Garrison, fellow students, for our science fair project Bill, Fosse, and I have spawned a creature genetically far superior to man. I present to you, the five-assed monkey.

Shot of Monkey with five asses.

Monkey

Ahhheh.

Mr. Garrison

Oh, Mr. Hat, isn't it beautiful.

More students clap.

Stan

Wait, wait, the pig just gave birth. It, it had a baby!

Kid 1

It had a baby?

Kid 2

Oh wow!

Clyde

What's it look like?

Kyle

Does it look like a pig, or an elephant?

Cartman

Hey, it kind of looks like Mr. Garrison.

Mr. Garrison

Ohh, uh, gee, isn't that an amazing coincidence? Hmm, what are the odds of that?

Hat

Hmmm. You boys get first prize.

Red, Butters, Bebe, Clyde, and Tolkien clap for the boys.

Cartman

That'll do pig.
