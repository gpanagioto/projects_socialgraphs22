Yes, it was ''fab''ulous! Well that sounds like a good deal. Oh, boy! Skiing in Aspen! I can't wait!  Oh, this is gonna be so much fun; I haven't skied in years! It's lovely. Thank you. Boys, we have to go to this time-share presentation real quick, but you go meet your ski instructor on the bunny hill. For only eight thousand dollars we can buy a condo here? Oh, you know, this ''is'' really great. Thank you.  There you are, boys!
