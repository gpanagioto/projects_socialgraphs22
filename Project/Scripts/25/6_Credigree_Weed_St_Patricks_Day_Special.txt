Tegridy Farms, kitchen, sunrise. Stan and Shelley are having breakfast, with Stan doing his homework at the same time. Sharon puts an egg for Shelley.

Sharon

Eat your breakfast, Stan, you're gonna be late for school.

Stan

You told me to finish my homework!

Sharon

Do both, come on guys, we gotta get going. [suddenly, Randy comes in, with a fake red beard on the face and dressed with a green big hat, green coat and brown shorts]

Randy

Hey whoa, whoa. What the fuck is going on?

Sharon

I'm about to take the kids to school, why?

Randy

Hello?! It's St. Patrick's day.

Stan

I know. I'm wearing green. [he shows a green T-shirt under his jacket]

Randy

You guys this is Tegridy Weed's biggest day of the year. I need help with the St. Patrick's Day Special.

Sharon

Sorry, Randy, the kids aren't missing school. Come on, guys, let's go. [she leaves with the children]

Randy

Okay, yeah, great, don't worry about it, I'll do it all myself. Again. [he picks a box of Tegridy Weed] Top O' the mornin' to ya! [he kicks the backdoor open and heads outside]

-----


The camera cuts to the backyard, where Towelie, all green, is smoking with a pipe and sitting near a table with other three boxes of Tegridy Weed.

Randy

This is God damn ridiculous. Piece a shit family.

Towelie

How's it going, Randy?

Randy

[he puts his box on the table] Ugh, I'm just so stressed out! We have to make a huge profit today or the whole year is fucked. How's the St. Patrick's Day Special?

Towelie

I think it's better than last year's.

Randy

Lemme see... [he tries the pipe] Oh, wow... Wow... [he tapdances] This is gonna be our best special ever! Come on, let's get the truck loaded up!

-----


The frontyard. Randy and Towelie are carrying the weed to their booth.

Randy

Let's sell what we can from our drive up booth, and then later we can hit the Irish bar. What the fuck? [he sees Steve, dressed just like him, setting up his own booth and throws the box he was carrying down in anger] Hey! Excuse me!

Steve

Oh, good morning, Randy.

Randy

What do you think you're doing?

Steve

Oh. We're, uh, doing a St. Patrick's Day Special.

Randy

No, you're not.

Steve

Uhh, yeah. We are.

Randy

So first you steal my idea of selling weed and now you're stealing my idea of doing a St. Patrick's Day Special!

Steve

Pretty sure St. Patrick's Day wasn't your idea.

Randy

Is that right? Okay... Game on, motherfucker. [he heads back inside] 

-----


Butters' house. In his bedroom, Butters checks his St. Patrick's Day's attire in the mirror.

Butters

[singing] Loo loo loo! It's St. Patrick's Day! Looo loo loo! De doot be do!

Linda

[from downstairs] Come on Butters, time for school!

Butters

Okay, mom! [he gets to the living room, where Stephen is reading a newspaper] Ohhh dad, are you wearin' green or are you gonna get a pinch?

Stephen

Ha ha... I've got a green tie on, you little rascal!

Linda

[comes in] And I'm wearing a green scarf!

Butters

Okay! Well someone's gettin a pinch today!

-----


South Park Elementary. A lot of students wearing green enter the building. Butters walks through the corridor, checking who's wearing green.

Butters

Hey, Clyde! You got your green on! Hey Jimmy! Nice green pants! Tee-hee! Te hee hee hee! [he walks to the boys, who also are wearing green] Happy St. Patrick's Day, fellas!

Kyle

Hey, Butters.

Butters

You guys all look very festive!

Cartman

[unenthusiastically] Yeah, it's super fun. St. Patrick's Day rules.

Butters

Oh, I hope they put green food coloring in our milk at lunchtime again like last year! [he notices a girl walking by him, who's apparently not wearing green] Uh-oh! Hey, Kelly-Ann! What's going on?

Kelly-Ann

What do you mean?

Butters

Looks like someone forgot what day it was! Ha ha! Pi-i-i-i-nch! [he pinches her]

-----


The camera cuts to the outside, where two police cars are parked. Inside, two police officers cuff Butters, with another two and the students watching.

Butters

I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I didn't mean to do anything wrong, honest!

Johnson

Do you know what sexual assault is?

Butters

I'm so sorry! Please! It's just... Well, she had it comin' on account of the way she was dressed!

Everyone

[groaning] Ohhh!

Johnson

Wow, kid, wow!

Officer

Alright. Take this shithead to the station and book him for sexual assault of a minor. [the two officers carry Butters outside]

Butters

Oh, jeez, I didn't know Kelly-Ann was a minor! Well, she didn't have a mining helmet or a pick axe or anything!

-----


Park County Police Station. Butters is in a cell, shivering.

Yates

[reading a file] Okay, looks like you assaulted a nine year old girl... No prior history... assault took place at an elementary school.

Butters

But... But, sir, it's St. Patrick's Day.

Yates

Look, I know! It's St. Patrick's Day, right? If people don't wear green, they get pinched!

Butters

Yes! Right!

Yates

Yeah... Only one problem. The little girl you pinched? Kelly-Ann Barlow? She was wearing green socks. [he shows a picture of Kelly-Ann with a green sock] You're a goddamn sexual predator. Don't let him jack off in here! These types always mess up my jail!

-----


Credigree Weed. The place is full of people buying Steve's special.

Steve

Welcome, everyone, welcome. Thank you for coming to Credigree Farms!

-----


Randy, who's hiding behind a bush, comes out and starts playing a flute. Everyone turns their eyes to him, and he hides back.

Steve

Randy, we all see you behind the bush. [Randy comes out, tries to play a little more and hides again] Everyone sees you. [Randy leaves the bush] 

Randy

[with a fake Irish accent] Oh. Uh... A very happy mornin', everybody! And a foine St. Patrick's Day to all of ye. I don't know if ya noohticed. But, uh, there's a farm across the street selling weed also... And the owner is actually 10 par-cent Irish!

Steve

So, obviously, you're upset that you don't seem to have any customers.

Randy

What I'm upset about is a wee little thing called "cultural appropriation". Ever heard of it? That's why we can't wear sombreros on Cinco de Mayo. Why we can't dress like Indians on Halloween.

Steve

What's your point? 

Randy

I'm looking at my point, you racist son of a bitch. You have no right to wear that stuff. It is offensive. Come on, guys! St. Patrick's Day is the one day of the year we have left where we can actually celebrate being white. Any other day that we tried to be proud of our culture, we would get immediately cancelled by Twitter! And yet for some reason, you're all over here, buying your weed from someone who is fine mocking our customs and traditions.

Steve

Maybe they're here because my St. Patrick's Day Special is better than yours. [Randy punches Steve and the two of them begin fighting]

-----


Sometime later, two police cars are parked in front of Credigree Weed. Two officers cuff Randy and carry him away.

Randy

Okay, yeah... Yeah, let's arrest the white leprechaun. Cuz, you know, can't have one day for a mostly white culture, right? Don't wanna get cancelled. I guess don't arrest him for cultural appropriations? Guess... Guess that only works one way, huh?

-----


Park County Police Station, interrogation room. Butters is cuffed to the table. Suddenly, a buzzer fires and a woman enters the room.

Public Defender

Leopold Stotch?

Butters

Yes?

Public Defender

I'm the public defender that's been assigned to your case.

Butters

Ugh... Okay... Oh, God... 

Public Defender

Is there a problem?

Butters

Wul, it's just... I mean... What you're wearing. You know, it's St. Patrick's Day, you're not wearing any... You don't have any green socks on, do you?

Public Defender

No, I'm wearing yellow socks. [she shows her socks] 

Butters

Ohhhhh God... I wanna pinch you so bad...

Public Defender

I'm here to help you, okay? Now, this woman that you're accused of groping, were you two in any kind of relationship? 

Butters

No, ma'am, could you... Maybe put on some green lipstick or something?

Public Defender

Before you touched the victim, did she give you any kind of consent?

Butters

Well, technically, yes! I mean, St. Patrick's Day is a wonderful day where we remember a British Roman man who went to Ireland and converted the whole country to Christianity! And he used a clover to represent the Holy Trinity, so we're supposed to celebrate that by wearing green and if you don't wear green you get a pinch!

Public Defender

And who is this St. Patrick to you?

Butters

See?! That's the problem! Nobody knows how great he really was.

Public Defender

[angry] Okay... [she walks to Butters] Can you show me where on the body you touched the girl?

Butters

Oh, God...

Public Defender

Did you put your fingers inside her?

Butters

I didn't finger nothin! I swear it was just a tiny little St. Patrick's Day pinch! It was... It was like this! [he pinches her hand, who slaps him in return] Ohhhg! [she slaps him again] Oh!

Public Defender

I am not representing this fucking animal! [she gets her things and leaves the room, then comes back and slaps Butters again]

Butters

Ohhgu!

-----


The work room. Two officers bring a man and a woman in custody.

Officer

We got some more St. Patrick's Day offenders.

Yates

Well, it's 10 a.m. and you people are already wasted, huh?

Man

Yeah, yeah, copper, you got me, big deal.

-----


The scene cuts to Butters, who's back in the cell along with six other people. One of them is peeing on the wall, and another one vomits on the floor.

Butters

[starts praying] Dear St. Patrick... If you're really up there... I've always done my best to honor you on this most holy day... You went to Ireland, and you got all those pagan worshippers to follow Christ. If there's any way... that you could help me now... just, like, send me a leprechaun or something... I will be forever your dark servant. Amen.

Johnson

[he opens the cell door] Alright, we got us another one! [an officer's shown carrying Randy]

Officer

Let's go, buddy. 

Randy

Yeah yeah, you don't have to push me, copper. 

Butters

Whoa... 

Yates

When are you people gonna learn, huh? It's not even lunchtime, for Christ's sake. [the officer pushes Randy inside the cell and Johnson closes the door]

Randy

I want my phone call.

Butters

Wow wee, are you a real leprechaun?

Randy

Yeah, I'm a real fucking leprechaun!

Butters

Alright! Are we gonna bust outta here or what?

Randy

Hell yeah we're gonna bust outta here, what do you have planned?

-----


A Jamaican style logo appears on screen. "The Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special". An announcer is also heard.

Announcer

Awww, yeah... And now back to the Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special.

-----


The scene cuts to Credigree Weed, which's still crowded. Steve's selling his special to a customer.

Steve

Alright, there you go, happy St. Patrick's Day and thanks for buying Credigree! [the customer leaves and an old man approaches him]

Farty O'Cool

Good afternoon, sir! Are you the creator of Credigree Weed?

Steve

I am.

Farty O'Cool

Well, I'm the owner of the Irish bar here in town. Farty O'Cools. We've got thousands of patrons today and I'm looking to score some weed.

Steve

You need marijuana for the Irish bar.

Farty O'Cool

Well, everyone's been drinkin' since 9 a.m. But now they need something to take the edge off until they start doing coke at 7:30.

Steve

Well, I'm sure we can help you out. How much Credigree are you looking to buy?

Farty O'Cool

Oh, I'd say we need about... Oh, two and a half tons of yer St. Patrick's Day Special.

Steve

Two and a half tons...

Farty O'Cool

Alright! Well, we'll see ya down at Farty O'Cools! [he leaves and Linda Black comes in]

Linda Black

Are you crazy? How are we gonna get that much weed together in time?

Steve

I don't know, babe, but this could really make our whole fiscal year!

Linda Black

I just hope you're not overdoin' it again.

Steve

Don't worry, we're gonna blow everyone's mind with our St. Patrick's Day Special!

-----


South Park Elementary, cafeteria, lunchtime. The boys are sitting with Jimmy and Tolkien and eating green hamburgers.

Cartman

Awesome... green hamburgers... How clever...

Stan

[his phone rings and he answers] Hello?

Randy

[an officer is watching him] Uh, yes, this is Randy Marsh, I've been incarcerated. I need to speak with my attorney.

Stan

Dad, it's me. You called the wrong person.

Randy

Yes, I am aware of that. Listen to me carefully. The canary is in the cage.

Stan

I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

Randy

Oh, a confidential matter? Lawyer client privilege. Uh, you know, there's an officer standing right here, actually. [the officer rolls his eyes and leaves] Oh... Oh it's okay, he's stepping away. [whispering] Stan! They got me locked up, you're gonna have to help me break outta here. We have to stop them.

Stan

Stop who?

Randy

Listen to me... is your friend Tolkien there?

Stan

Yeah, Tol-l-l-kien is sitting right here.

Randy

Yeah, well, his piece a shit dad is trying to take over the St. Patrick's Day Special!

Stan

I don't care.

Randy

You better care, because if we don't make money today you and sister are gonna starve. Do you understand? And I won't be able to pay the Wi-Fi bill.

Stan

Okay, what do you want me to do?

Randy

I need you to leave school, go home, and get a jar of the St. Patrick's Day Special weed and sneak it into the police station.

Stan

Dad, it's St. Patrick's Day. We're gonna do a scavenger hunt at recess.

Randy

I'm asking you to do one little thing. Ditch school, get weed, sneak into the police station. Do it or no more Wi-Fi, I mean it! [the officer comes back] Piece a shit lawyer! [he hangs up]

-----


A stained-glass window of Saint Patrick is shown.

Butters

[narrating] St. Patrick was not Irish. He was a Roman British man who was made a slave by Irish Barbarians. But St. Patrick heard the voice of God... and he used his situation for good, and God told him to be brave! [he's standing on the toilet, telling the story to the other detainees] And that is why... On this one day of the year, we must be like St. Patrick ourselves! [one of them farts] The police don't even care about St. Patrick's Day! Do you see any of them wearing green?! No! If we do St. Patrick's bidding, he will provide for us! [meanwhile, the officer from before bring Randy back to the cell]

Officer

Okay, back in you go. [he opens the door, pushes Randy in and closes it again]

Butters

Pi-i-i-i-nch! [he pinches the officer's leg]

Officer

[screams in panic] Oh my God! Oh my God! [Johnson comes by] He just touched me and he didn't ask for consent or anything.

Johnson

Okay, okay, I'll take care of it... [he tases Butters, who passes out] Is that better?

Officer

I just need to take a shower and cry. Oh my God.

-----


The reception room. An officer is using his phone. The boys enter the station, with Cartman holding a cake.

Officer

Can I help you?

Cartman

Hello, sir, we are with the Clover Club. We try to spread a little St. Patrick's Day cheer by donating baked goods to prison inmates who cannot celebrate this festive time. [the officer accompanies the boys to the cell room]

Officer

Alright, it's your lucky day, folks, some kids brought you some holiday cheer.

Randy

Wha... Wha... What's happening?! What's happening?

Stan

Hey, there, we brought you a cake.

Randy

I told you to bring me weed, not a cake!

Stan

[he pinches his nose, frustrated] God dammit. You... You should just enjoy the cake.

Randy

You don't fucking listen to me, do you?! You're incapable of ever doing anything right because-- [he finally takes the hint] Oh, a cake. [he winks] Gooot it. Thank you very much. [the officer opens the cell door and Butters wakes up with the noise]

Butters

Whu... Oh, hey, fellas.

Cartman

How's your St. Patrick's Day going, Butters?

Butters

Pretty good.

Cartman

Awesome.

Stan

Well, see ya. [the boys leave and Randy takes a jar of his special from inside the cake]

Butters

What are you gonna do?

Randy

It's simple... There's always cops looking to make a score. You just gotta find the one willing to trade some drugs for a favor. [he makes a joint with the weed] And once they get a whiff of my St. Patrick's Day Special, they won't be able to resist. [he lights the joint and takes a drag] Oh... Oh, man, that is strong...

Butters

I knew St. Patrick would perform a miracle to get us out of here! Just like when he was a slave, he will help us go free!

Randy

White people were slaves in history? Nuh-uh. [he takes another drag] Gah, it's such a good special, it's just such a shame people are trying to ruin it. [he takes another drag, walks to Johnson, who's keeping guard, and blows the smoke on his face] Hey, my bruthuh. You got a second?

Johnson

What do you want?

Randy

You don't wanna miss out on the only white holiday still allowed, do ya? How'd you like to be able to, uh, celebrate a little?

Johnson

Yeah, of course I would, but I can't. 

Officer

Hey guys! How'd you like to be able to celebrate a little?! [he brings in a box of the Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special] Check it out! They're handing out free weed down at Farty O'Cools! It's the Credigree St. Patrick's Day Special! [the other officers join him and start smoking]

Officers

Wow!

Johnson

Ooh, hey, I'm in. [he joins them too]

Randy

No!

Officer

Ooh da lolly!

Officer

St. Patrick's Day! Wow, look at it!

Officer

I thought I wouldn't be able to get wasted till later!

Randy

[he sits on the toilet, defeated] That's it. It's over. My plan is done.

Butters

It is not over! What did St. Patrick say when he was taken from his homeland and turned into a slave?! St. Patrick didn't give up! And when the Christians slandered him while he was trying to convert the heathen Irish, did he give up then?! [Randy ignores him and rushes to the bars in anger]

Officer

Man, that is strong ass shit.

Officer

You can taste the Irishness. [Randy gets angrier]

Officer

This weed is amazing and it has so much cred.

Officer

You know, I've never really been a fan of the holiday Specials, but this one is really good. [Randy gets so angry that suddenly sparkles comes from him and he forces the cell door open]

Butters

Yeah!

Officers

[they notice Randy] Whoa!

Butters

You see?! The power of St. Patrick compels you! [Randy fires rainbows from his hands, blasting the officers away]

Officers

Oh! Whoa! Aah! Aah!

Butters

Yes, now use your clover rays! [Randy fires his clover rays on another two officers, sending them spinning away]

Officers

Oh! Ugugghghh! Whoa!

Randy

Me golden coins of spite! [he tosses golden coins on the remaining officers, knocking them down]

Officers

Oh! Oh! [with all the officers down, Randy and Butters exit the station]

-----


The Jamaican style logo shows up again. "The Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special". And again, the announcer is heard.

Announcer

And now for the thrilling conclusion of the Credigree St. Patrick's Day Special.

-----


The scene cuts to the Farty O'Cool's Irish Pub, nighttime. Irish folk music is playing. There are a lot of people outside and inside, where Steve and Linda are selling their special.

Linda Black

My God! I never thought we'd sell this much weed!

Steve

Keep it up, babe! We've still got a long way to go!

Patron

Hey, everyone! Everyone! Everyone, quiet! Turn up the TV! [everyone stays quiet and Farty O' Cool turns up the TV's volume]

Tom

Once again the town of South Park is on high alert after a sexual predator escaped from custody. Everyone who's out at bars or restaurants for St. Patrick's Day need to be on the lookout for the sexual psychopath. [the scene cuts to Bill]

Bill

Tom, I'm standing outside the South Park Police Station, where just moments ago a sexual predator broke free. [footage of Randy and Butters escaping the jail is shown, with Butters being highlighted] Surveillance cameras inside the station captured the dramatic escape. [back to Bill] Police claim they tried to stop the felon from escaping, but they were just, "Way too high." Back to you, Tom.

-----


Tegridy Farms. Towelie's still by the booth, smoking with the pipe.

Towelie

[singing] I've been a wild rover for many's the year, I've spent all me money on good weed and beer [suddenly, a police car stops by, and Randy and Butters come out of it]

Randy

Towelie... where is all the St. Patrick's Day Special?

Towelie

Randy... I... I thought... you were in jail.

Randy

The weed's all gone, does that mean you were able to sell it?

Towelie

Yeah I sort of... sold it... at half price... to Tolkien's dad across the street.

Randy

What?!

Towelie

You were gone! Tolkien's dad said he'd buy all the weed and I figured that's what we should do!

Randy

So you mean that right now everyone down at the Irish bar is enjoying my special and they don't even know it?!

Towelie

Randy, I'm sorr-- [Randy grabs Towelie, crumbles him and throws him on the ground]

Randy

Come on, let's go! [he and Butters go back to the car]

-----


The scene cuts again to the Farty O'Cool's Irish Pub, where the Blacks are still selling their special.

Steve

Thank you! Thank you! Thanks for choosing Credigree Weed!

Randy

Stop right there, you piece a shit! [music and chatter stop] Is everyone enjoying the special?!

Steve

Randy... I-I thought you were in jail. 

Randy

Oh, yes, so did a lot of people. But you see there's just one thing wrong. [he takes the jar from one of the patrons] This isn't Credigree Weed's special. [he rips off the Credigree Weed label from the jar, revealing his own underneath] It's moine. [everyone gasps]

Linda Black

Babe! That's how you got so much weed?! 

Steve

I used both.

Randy

You see?! This is what happens when you appropriate a culture! It's sort of your special and it's sort of not your special... And nobody knows whose special it is.

Steve

I guess I just let the holiday go to my head. But I learned that--

Randy

No! No no no no no! You don't get to say what you learned 'cause it's not your special! This holiday is about Tegridy.

Woman

Oh my God! It's him! It's the sexual predator! [Butters gets nervous]

Stevens

[smoking weed] What, what, he's here?!

Butters

Uh oh! [he flees]

Stevens

[he draws his gun] Stop right there!

-----


Butters runs outside, screaming. Stevens runs after him and start shooting. Butters runs to the streets, but two police cars close on him and he runs to the opposite direction. Three officers exit from the car and point their guns at him.

Officer

There he is, get him!

Butters

Wahggh! [he notices other two cars, with Yates and other two officers pointing their guns at him]

Yates

[he cocks his gun] Freeze!

Butters

Ahghggh! [he's now surrounded]

Yates

Don't move, Weinstein, you've got nowhere else to go! [suddenly, a green glows emerges from the sky]

Saint Patrick

[from above] Leave the child alone... [everyone looks at the glow descending on the street and taking the form of Saint Patrick]

Everyone

Ohh!

Randy

Whoa-a-a!

Butters

It's him! It's St. Patrick!

Saint Patrick

What... exactly is going on here. You've persecuted this little boy for grabbing people? Why, it's ridiculous! You've all besmirched a perfectly good white holiday. Where we all like to get drunk and assault each other! It's St. Patrick's Day! [he pinches a woman's butt] Remember the reason for the season! [he grabs another woman's breast and humps a third woman]

Woman

Oh, my God!

Woman

Ooh! Hey!

Saint Patrick

Who wants a pinch? [he grabs another woman's breast] Oh, yes, very nice!

Man

Hey, you can't do that, man!

Saint Patrick

[he fills a cup with booze for himself] What do you mean I can't? Do you know what day it is?! [he approaches a woman wearing a blouse with "Kiss me I'm Irish" written on it] Ah, see, here we go. "Kiss me I'm Irish!" That's more like it! [he licks her butt, wriggling his tongue]

Woman

Oh, my God! [she runs off]

Saint Patrick

No, you bought the shirt, bitch! [he approaches two men] Come on, let's have a go! It's me day! Take your dick out. [he puts his hand on one of the men's crotch] Who wants him to take his dick out?

Man

I will not!

Saint Patrick

What is this? Are you people all some kind of Scottish poofters?

Man

Hey, that is a homophobic slur!

Saint Patrick

You're calling me homophobic? Because I will gladly fuck any man here. We celebrate St. Patrick's Day for four simple reasons. I. Love. To. Fuck.

Man

Wow, St. Patrick, wow. You're a real jerk.

Woman

Yeah, what a creep. Come on girls, let's go. [they leave]

Man

To hell with him and to hell with this Tegridy Weed St. Patrick's Day Special. [he tosses his Tegridy Weed jar on the ground and leaves, disgusted]

Randy

[everyone else does the same] Aw... Aww!

Saint Patrick

Where is everybody going? This party fucking sucks! Doesn't anybody want a pinch?

-----


South Park, daytime. A street sweeper cleans all the mess left by the partying last night. It runs over an unconscious guy as well.

Tom

[narrating] The party is over... A new day has come... [the scene cuts to him] And now... St. Patrick's Day, the only holiday left where white people could celebrate a culture... has been cancelled. And as for the mysterious, sexually charged being who groped and assaulted so many. He... is doing five years community service.

-----


The scene cuts to Butters, who's picking trash on the street as part of his community service. He doesn't look happy.

Butters

Once again... I shoulda never listened to what they told me in church.

-----
