Totally, you guys; this has gone far enough.  You hear that guys? It'd better not happen again tonight!  I am so, seriously. 'Sup dudes?  Are you serious?! All night broship ''Counter-Strike'' party? That's fucking sweet! Does your uncle's cabin have good wifi? Bros!! Dude, that's so awesome! This is gonna be the best night ever! This is gonna be so awesome. Just hanging with the bros playing ''Counter-Strike'' all night. Alone in the woods - you pumped Tolkien? I'm totally gonna do some massive pwnage. Whoever's on my team will be stoked. My laptop's so fast it doesn't lag at all. I can jump around like a pwnage powerhouse. You guys all seem kinda, like, bummed out. Is everything cool? Okay, cool. Goin' a long way to play ''Counter-Strike''. Guess it's sweet though there won't be any adults to screw it up for us. How much further now? This place has sweet wifi, right? Gon' be so awesome. Oh, dude, is this it? This is cool. So isolated.  Check it out, there's a shovel next to a hole dug in the ground. Dude, is this where we're gonna play? I call dibs on this side! What's the wifi called? Is there a password? I don't see it - I don't see it coming up on my laptop. I don't know, I think maybe the wifi's not working. Where's the box?  You gotta unplug it and plug it back in.  You guys? You guys...? There's...no wifi... What are you...What are you guys talking about - What- Oh my God.

We can still just play Counter-Strike, and forget everything! Oh-my-God, there's no wifi - We can use my phone, to make a hotspot and we can still play Counter-Strike! And it'll be sweet!
