==Publication history==
Jean DeWolff first appeared in ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #48-51 (August–November 1976), and was created by [[Bill Mantlo]] and [[Sal Buscema]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Manning |first2=Matthew K. |title=Spider-Man Chronicle: Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging |date=2012 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-0756692360 |page=89}}</ref> She was one of the few supporting cast members in ''Marvel Team-Up''.<ref name="back44">{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=Jonathan|date=October 2010|title=Spider-Man and Company: The Wide World of Marvel Team-Up|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|issue=44|page=39}}</ref> DeWolff subsequently appeared in ''Marvel Team-Up'' #60-62 (August–October 1977), #65-66 (January–February 1978), #72 (August 1978), #88 (December 1979), ''Ms. Marvel'' #6-7 (June–July 1977), ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #226 (March–April 1982), #239 (April 1983), and ''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #103 (June 1985).

The character was [[Kill off|killed off]] in the storyline "[[The Death of Jean DeWolff]]", spanning ''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #107-110 (October 1985 – January 1986). She has since made posthumous appearances in ''The Sensational She-Hulk'' #53 (July 1993), ''Venom Super Special'' #1 (August 1995), and ''Spider-Man/Human Torch'' #4 (June 2005).

Jean DeWolff received an entry in the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition]]'' #17, and ''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Spider-Man'' #1 (2005) and ''The Official Handbook of the Ultimate Marvel Universe: Fantastic Four and Spider-Man'' #1 (2005).

In 2010, comics journalist Jonathan Miller described DeWolff as "a secondary character that could facilitate a sense of continuity [in ''Marvel Team-Up''], someone who knew only the costumed side of Peter's personality, and yet had a genuine relationship with him. Hard-edged and no-nonsense, DeWolff usually made her entrance in her vintage [[Roadster (automobile)|roadster]], cigarette dangling from the corner of her mouth, a modern, post-feminist take on the classic tough-guy heroes of [[Dashiell Hammett]] and [[Mickey Spillane]]".<ref name="back44" />

==Fictional character biography==

=== Early history ===
Jean's first rejection comes as a child from her harsh and disapproving father Phillip DeWolff, an officer of the [[NYPD]], who resents having a daughter rather than another son. Her mother Celia gets divorced from Phillip six months after Jean's birth, taking her older brother [[Wraith (Brian DeWolff)|Brian DeWolff]] with her. Jean and Brian develop a close and loving relationship over the years despite their parents' separation. Four years after the divorce, Celia marries police patrolman Carl Weatherby, who gives Jean the love she never got from her real father. Inspired by Carl, Jean joins the police academy as an adult, but this breaks Celia's heart, as she views the police force as a source of stress and danger. It also angers her father, who is now the New York police commissioner; he dismisses Jean and other women as unfit for police duty while showering praise on Brian for joining the NYPD after graduating top of his class at the academy. Just before Jean graduates from the academy, witnesses see Brian shot in the line of duty, but the body disappears before police or rescue services arrive. Phillip retires as police commissioner soon afterward.<ref name=autogenerated1>''Marvel Team-Up'' #49 (1976). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Driven by resentment towards her disapproving parents and fueled by anger and grief over Brian's apparent death, DeWolff grows into a tough, unrelenting police officer. She quickly rises in the ranks, becoming a detective and then a sergeant, known for her no-nonsense attitude, as well as her vintage car and preference for 1930s-style clothing. Just over two years after her father's retirement, DeWolff is promoted by his successor to the rank of captain, running Manhattan's 5th precinct.<ref name=autogenerated1/>

While investigating bombings by a criminal known only as the [[Wraith (Brian DeWolff)|Wraith]], DeWolff discovers [[Spider-Man]] and [[Iron Man]] are also looking into the matter. While many in the NYPD don't care for super-powered vigilantes, Jean sees value in the web-slinger and the armored [[Avengers (comics)|Avenger]] and openly asks them for assistance, going so far as to allow the two access to precinct files. The two heroes, along with [[Doctor Strange]], help DeWolff discover that the Wraith is her psionically-powered brother who is alive but in a coma, his actions the result of her corrupt father's machinations. Doctor Strange's combination of magic and surgical skills restores Brian's mind. Phillip is sent to prison, and Jean welcomes her brother back as he rejoins the NYPD.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #48-51 (1976). Marvel Comics.</ref>

The DeWolff siblings continue to aid superheroes on different occasions, with Jean developing a regular working relationship and friendship with Spider-Man, despite her acerbic attitude and the web-slinger's need to keep his identity and full life separate. On Spider-Man's request, DeWolff even draws up amnesty papers for the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] so she can retire from crime and become Spider-Man's romantic partner and ally in crime-fighting.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #227 (1982). Marvel Comics.</ref> When the Black Cat is later seriously injured and hospitalized, DeWolff personally assigns her a protection detail in case any enemies try to take advantage of the situation.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #239 (1983). Marvel Comics.</ref>

=== Death ===
Jean later receives former [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent [[Sin-Eater (comics)|Stanley Carter]] as her partner, and the two develop a close bond, eventually becoming lovers. Unbeknownst to Jean, however, Carter has an obsession with punishing criminals, which is only worsened by his experiences as a cop, to the point where he decides all "sinners" need to die. Suffering a psychotic break, Carter, now calling himself the "Sin-Eater", embarks on a killing spree, resulting in DeWolff [[The Death of Jean DeWolff|being shot dead in her home]] and Spider-Man embarking on a quest for revenge. Eventually, Spider-Man and [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] bring Sin-Eater to justice.<ref name="death">''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #107-110 (1985). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Following Jean's death, Spider-Man discovers the woman kept a collection of news clippings, as well as a photo of Spider-Man with Black Cat that was cut to remove the latter from the image. Spider-Man is shocked by the implication that Jean had unspoken feelings for him over the years.<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #108. Marvel Comics.</ref> It is later revealed that when Spider-Man temporarily used the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] symbiote as a costume, Jean spoke to Spider-Man about her feelings, saying the hero was the only other person she felt she could rely on and she loved him, not knowing that the alien symbiote was in control and lacked a full understanding of human behavior. When Spider-Man silently leaned in for a kiss (the alien symbiote believing this was the expected human response to words of love), DeWolff seemed to feel awkward and clarified that she loved him as a friend, adding that she would prefer never to speak about this conversation again.<ref>''Venom Super Special'' #1 (1995). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Jean's death also drives her family apart: Celia blames Carl for her daughter's death as Carl had inspired her to join the police force in the first place. Driven mad with grief over Sin-Eater's murder of his sister, Brian declares vengeance against the entire NYPD before being shot and killed with an explosive bullet by a [[Scourge of the Underworld|lethal vigilante]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #278. Marvel Comics.</ref>

=== Post-mortem ===
Years after Jean's death, her close friend [[Wraith (Yuri Watanabe)|Yuri Watanabe]], who had also risen to the rank of Captain and used her position to assist Spider-Man, adopts the Wraith identity after losing faith in the law's ability to punish criminals. She wears a mask of Jean's face originally created by the [[Chameleon (Marvel Comics)|Chameleon]] under her Wraith costume, as both a means of hiding her true identity and frightening criminals into believing that the Wraith was Jean's vengeful spirit risen to continue fighting crime.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #663-664. Marvel Comics.</ref>

A clone of Jean appears during the ''[[Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy]]'' event. This clone, a "reanimate" with all of Jean's memories including her death, lives in a special facility called "Haven" and is created by a villain wishing to gain Spider-Man's cooperation by resurrecting all those whose deaths haunt the web-slinger. A machine connected to Haven is later activated that destabilizes the bodies of the reanimates, making them vulnerable to infection by the deadly Carrion virus dormant in their clone cells. Several reanimates attempt to escape, hoping their bodies will stabilize if they are far enough away from Haven. Realizing that fleeing means potentially transmitting the Carrion virus to innocent people outside of Haven, Jean's clone assists Spider-Man in stopping any clones from escaping. During her efforts, she succumbs to the virus and dies.<ref>''The Clone Conspiracy'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When Spider-Man confronts [[Harry Osborn#Kindred|Kindred]] during the "[[Last Remains]]" arc, he finds that the demon had dug up the bodies of Jean DeWolff, Uncle Ben, Gwen Stacy, George Stacy, Ned Leeds, J. Jonah Jameson Sr., and Marla Jameson and sat them around a dinner table.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #51. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Although [[Alaska P. Davidson]] was made a special agent with the FBI in 1922 along with two other women, none were active by 1929 and the FBI did not officially accept female agents again until 1972.<ref>''Spider-Man Noir: Eyes Without a Face'' #1-4</ref>

Afterwards, Spider-Man learns she was in the Kingpin's employ, as well as a rumor that she was his lover.
