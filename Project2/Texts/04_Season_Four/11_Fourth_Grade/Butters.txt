Well, buh wuh when we pull our pants down,  should we stand frontways or back? I mean, do we show 'er our... behinds, or-ar our w-wieners? Uh-uh, maybe we could stand like this , with our wieners pokin' through the back of our legs, you know, and give 'er a nice fruit bowl. Huhuh, look at all this stuff. Huh-it sure was. Oowuh how are we gonna do that? Does it hurt?  I don't wanna do it if it hurts. Or if it... makes you get all sticky. Yeh-hah. They don't even realize that "The Menagerie" originally ''was'' the pilot and ''later'' got split up into two episodes, eh ha ha. Ha ha.  Hahahaha, eh the, eh the dumbasses.
