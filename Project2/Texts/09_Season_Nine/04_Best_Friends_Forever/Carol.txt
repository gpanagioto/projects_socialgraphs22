Kenny? Kenny, are you still playin' with that thing?  Kenny, it's been two weeks and you've done nothin' else! Who cares if you almost made it to level sixty?! You're wastin' your life, Kenny! If you died tomorrow, what would you have to show for it?! You're gonna end up wishin' you'd done more with your life, ''just like your dead-beat father''! I wasn't talkin' to you, asshole!!  I'd like to see you try! It's my house too, you no-good loser! Will he ever recover? He's alive. He-ee smiles when I talk to him. I think... He did? When? Look, Kenny, your friends are here to visit you again. What? No doctor! You can't!
