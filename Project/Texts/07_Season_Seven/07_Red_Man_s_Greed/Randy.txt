Now, Eric, they're called Native Americans, remember? Show some respect. All right, time to win some money! Oooo, the nickel slots! You might win the thirty-dollar jackpot! Ahh, women, huh? God I hate 'em.  How's it goin', Gerald? Yeah, I know what you mean. I'm down three hundred bucks. Yeah, well, maybe we should- ...wait. Twenty-six thousand dollars?? Gerald, twenty-six thousand-! Where did you get that kind of money??  Just six quarters! He... he lost his house to the Native Americans. They don't care.   But how can they do that?! No, screw that! We'll just pool our money together and buy the town ourselves!  How much do we have to raise, Mayor? Ohhh, never mind.   How can you do this to people? There's more to life than profits! Well like, you know, Slurpees and stuff.  Stan, we've all tried to raise money, but we only raise ten thousand dollars, and the deadline is tomorrow. Yeah.  But it's the only shot we've got to save our town. All right, boys. You're gonna have to wait here.  It's in God's hand now.  We're gonna try and beat you at your own game, Chief Runs With Premise! Ten thousand dollars!  Oh hell yeah! Let it ride! Dammit! Stan? Okay? You just don't understand the fine points of gambling. You're never supposed to stop when you're on a winning streak. Stan? Okay? All right? Stan? Okay?  I'm sorry, Native Americans. Stanley, we don't have a choice. The Native Americans own South Park now. We have to take what they'll give us for our homes. It'll be okay, boys, we'll just... move to the next town over. We can stand here as long as it takes.   What do they want? You... understand if I'm a little wary of trusting you. Well, thanks.  How's your... mother? It's cool on my tongue. Stanley, listen to me. I have SARS. There's only a ninety-eight percent chance that I will live. Listen, Stan. SARS is destroying our people. The Native Americans put it in the blankets they gave us.  You... must find a cure for SARS, son. And save our people. The spirit of middle-class white people is strong in you, son. Seek out the wise man in Bellow Creek. Now go. GO!  Stanley. Did you have an inward journey with the old man? Did you have a vision?? Yes. Yes, of course. Quickly, Stan, we must give it to everyone!  We have cured ourselves using the medicines of our culture. We're a simple people. All we want is to be allowed to live our lives.
