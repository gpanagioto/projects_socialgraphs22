(Oh wait, you guys. See, I don't have a phone.) (Woohoo!)  (Hey dude, check it out! I got my pail!) (Yup!) (But we always trick or treat together) (Guys, please.) (Hey dude. Uh, look. I was wondering, do you think I could trick or treat with you guys this year?) (Oh, you know, I just thought I'd switch it up this year, hehe) (Oh I won't slow you guys down. I swear!) (Hey guys!)  (So listen, I was thinking, maybe I'd trick or treat with you guys this year!) (Oh, you know! Just trying to be gender-neutral, hahahaha!) (I, I just... It's Halloween and I should be happy, but I'm not happy at all.) (Yeah! What should I do? I'm gonna miss trick-or-treating. It sucks.) (I can't use one. I don't have a phone.) (No. It sucks. Halloween was a night without phones, man.) (I don't know. I guess if you-)  (Wait a minute. Take down the cell phone tower. Then nobody has a phone on Halloween!) (Yeah! I just have to ride thirty minutes outside of town! Oh, wait. I can't. I don't have a scooter.) (Let's just hope to hell this works.) (Yeah, people don't even care if shit's dumped everywhere. Everyone just loves technology) (Find a way inside. I'll climb the tower.) (Oh, fuck!)  (Dude, relax. It's okay.) (Okay, that's got it!)  (Trick or treat!)
