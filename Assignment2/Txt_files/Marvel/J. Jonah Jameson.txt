'''John Jonah Jameson Jr.'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicvine.com/j-jonah-jameson/29-1487/|title=J. Jonah Jameson|publisher=[[Comic Vine]]}}<!--source for "Jonah"--></ref><ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #579<!--source for "Junior"--></ref> is a [[fiction]]al [[Character (arts)|character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]], most commonly in association with the [[superhero]] [[Spider-Man]]. The character was created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]], and he first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' issue #1 (March [[1983 in comics|1963]]).

Jameson is typically depicted as the [[publisher]] or [[editor-in-chief]] of the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'', a fictional [[New York City]] newspaper. Recognizable by his [[toothbrush moustache]], [[flattop]] haircut, and ever-present [[cigar]], he carries out a [[smear campaign]] against Spider-Man (and to a lesser extent other superheroes such as [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]]), frequently referring to him as a "menace" and a criminal, but occasionally and reluctantly allying with him. This usually stems from his deep-seated belief in law enforcement and government agencies, and thus despises superheroes for working outside the system. In the early comics he employs [[photojournalism|photojournalist]] Peter Parker to take pictures of Spider-Man in the hopes of catching him in the middle of wrongdoing, unaware that Peter is the superhero himself. Over the course of the comics, Jameson has done various other jobs, most notably being the [[Mayor of New York City]] for several years before resigning. Jameson eventually learned of Peter's identity twice: the first during the "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]" event, which led him to increase his attacks and was undone by the events of the "[[One More Day (comics)|One More Day]]"; and the second years later, which caused him to finally give up his crusade on Spider-Man.

Portrayals of Jameson have varied throughout the years. Sometimes he is shown as a foolishly grumpy, stubborn and pompous [[wikt:skinflint|skinflint]] who micromanages his employees and whose resentment of Spider-Man is actually a thinly-veiled exercise in envy. Other writers have portrayed him more empathetically, as a humorously obnoxious yet caring boss and family man who nevertheless has shown great bravery and integrity in the face of the assorted villains with which the ''[[Daily Bugle|Bugle]]'' comes into contact, and whose campaign against Spider-Man comes more from the aforementioned political motivations. In either case, he has remained an important part of the Spider-Man mythos.

He and Peter Parker are related by marriage as a result of his father's wedding to [[Aunt May|May Parker]]. Jameson's son [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]] is a [[Marvel Universe]] supporting character who, in addition to his job as a famous astronaut, has become Man-Wolf and Star-God and also married [[She-Hulk]], making Jonah her father in-law before she and John divorced.

The character has appeared in numerous media adaptations related to Spider-Man; he usually assumes his early role as Peter's employer, but this has lessened in recent years as depictions of Spider-Man focused around his science and superhero careers, with Jameson simply being Spider-Man's tormentor. [[J. K. Simmons]] portrayed [[J. Jonah Jameson (film character)|the character]] in [[Sam Raimi]]'s [[Spider-Man (2002 film series)|''Spider-Man'' trilogy]] (2002–2007), in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) films ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]'' (2019) and ''[[Spider-Man: No Way Home]]'' (2021), also appearing in the web series ''[[The Daily Bugle (web series)|The Daily Bugle]]'' (2019‐present) and an uncredited [[cameo appearance]] in the [[Sony's Spider-Man Universe]] film ''[[Venom: Let There Be Carnage]]'' (also 2021). Simmons also voices him in various additional works, such as ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]''.

==Publication history==
Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]], Jameson first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' issue #1 (March 1963). Stan Lee stated in an interview on ''[[Talk of the Nation]]'' that he modeled J. Jonah Jameson as a much grumpier version of himself.<ref>Conan, Neal (October 27, 2010). [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130862700 "Stan Lee, Mastermind Of The Marvel Universe"]. [[NPR]].</ref> Later Spider-Man writers [[Tom DeFalco]] and [[Gerry Conway]] agreed that J. Jonah Jameson was as close as Lee ever came to a self-portrayal, with Conway elaborating that "just like Stan is a very complex and interesting guy who both has a tremendously charismatic part of himself and is an honestly decent guy who cares about people, he also has this incredible ability to go immediately to shallow. Just, BOOM, right to shallow. And that's Jameson".<ref name="back91menace">{{cite journal|last=Trumbull|first=John |title=J. Jonah Jameson: Hero or Menace? |journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=91|pages=37–41 |date=September 2016}}</ref> Conway stated that whenever he wrote Jameson's dialogue, he would hear it in Lee's voice, and on one occasion even wrote a Jameson speech that was almost directly quoted from a Stan Lee speech.<ref name="back91menace"/>

The Spider-Man creative staff considered Jameson's wedding to Marla Madison in ''Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #18 (1984) a momentous enough event that they asked Stan Lee to script the story, while the art team on the issue emulated Steve Ditko's style.<ref name="back91foe">{{cite journal|last=Trumbull|first=John|title=J. Jonah Jameson: Spidey's Most Persistent Foe? |journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=91 |pages=29–35 |date=September 2016}}</ref>

Jameson has been a mainstay of the Spider-Man supporting cast, and on a few rare occasions has been given a starring role, including ''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #80 (July 1983), ''Web of Spider-Man'' #52 (July 1989) (in which Spider-Man himself only appears in a single panel), and ''Spider-Man's Tangled Web'' #20 (January 2003).

==Fictional character biography==
===Background===
According to "Behind the Mustache", a story featured in ''[[Spider-Man's Tangled Web]]'' #20 (January 2003), Jameson was raised as a child by David and Betty Jameson. David was an officer of the [[United States Army]], a war veteran decorated as a hero; at home, however, David regularly abused his wife and son. As a result, J. Jonah Jameson grew convinced that "No one's a hero every day of the week" and "Even the real heroes can't keep it up all the time". Later issues of ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' clarified that David Jameson was in fact Jonah's foster father, and the brother of J. Jonah Jameson Sr., Jonah's biological father, who had to leave his son behind for undisclosed reasons.

He was a [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scout]] during his childhood. In high school, his interests were mainly [[boxing]] and [[photography]]. He met his first wife, Joan, when they both joined their high school's photo club. When the school's three top athletes started [[bullying]] him, he fought back and beat all three of them to a pulp. This impressed Joan, and they started dating. They married as soon as they finished school.

After school, Jameson sought employment as a [[journalist]]. In ''[[Marvels]]'' #1, a young reporter brags to his colleagues that he would one day run the ''Daily Bugle''; according to writer [[Kurt Busiek]], he and artist [[Alex Ross]] intended this to be J. Jonah Jameson, but the editor of the Spider-Man line objected that Jameson was too young to have been alive during the early 1940s, when the story was set. Since it was too late to redraw the scene, the editor settled for having Jameson's name removed from the issue.<ref name="back91foe"/> When the U.S.A. joined [[World War II]] in 1941, Jameson served as a [[war correspondent]] in Europe. ''Sergeant Fury and His Howling Commandos'' #110 featured him as covering a mission of Sergeant [[Nick Fury|Nicholas Fury]], who was heading [[Howling Commandos|a team of commandos]] during the war.

After the war, he and Joan had a son, John Jonah III, who grew up to become an astronaut. When Jameson returned from a journalistic mission in [[Korea]], he was grieved to find that his wife had died in a mugging incident. Focusing on his professional life to dull the pain, he was promoted to chief editor of the ''Daily Bugle'', and eventually came to own the paper, thereby fulfilling his earlier boasts.{{Citation needed|date=June 2022}}

Jameson gained a mostly deserved reputation for journalistic integrity, but his greedy opportunism and unyielding belligerent stubbornness made him more than a few enemies.{{Citation needed|date=June 2022}}

=== Spider-Man ===
[[File:Jjonahjameson.jpg|thumb|upright|J. Jonah Jameson in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #29 (Oct. 1965), art by [[Steve Ditko]]]]
J. Jonah Jameson was part of the audience that saw the Amazing [[Spider-Man]]'s first TV broadcast.<ref name="SpideyInterview">{{Cite comic |writer=[[Chip Zdarsky|Zdarsky, Chip]] |artist=Michael Walsh |colorist=Ian Herring |letterer=Travis Lanham |title=[[Peter Parker: The Spectacular Spider-Man]] |issue=6 |url=https://www.comics.org/issue/1746669/#2223173 |story=My Dinner With Jonah |date=November 1, 2017 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] |editor=Allison Stock, Devin Lewis, and [[Nick Lowe]]}}</ref> However, when Spider-Man becomes a masked vigilante, Jameson strives to blacken Spider-Man's reputation; casting the masked hero as an unhinged vigilante not only boosts the ''[[Daily Bugle]]''{{'}}s circulation, but also punishes Spider-Man for overshadowing Jameson's astronaut son. When Spider-Man tries to counter the bad press by rescuing his son from danger, Jameson accuses the hero of staging the situation for his own benefit.<ref name=autogenerated9>''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #1</ref>

This episode sets a pattern with Jameson's and Spider-Man's relationship: Jameson publicly accusing Spider-Man of numerous crimes and misdeeds, only to feel continually obliged to print almost as many retractions after being proven wrong. The lead story of the following issue, ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #2 (May 1963), sets another part of the pattern: Peter Parker selling pictures of himself as Spider-Man to the ''Bugle'' with few questions asked, and Jonah using the pictures to support his editorials against Spider-Man, unaware that he is giving him gainful employment in the process.<ref name="back91foe"/> After his accusations that Spider-Man is the notorious criminal overlord The Big Man are debunked, Jameson admits that he is jealous of Spider-Man's courage and selflessness. Jameson believes that he cannot look at himself as a good man while a hero like Spider-Man exists.<ref>''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #10</ref> Despite this, he openly idolizes [[Captain America]], and [[Mary Jane Watson-Parker]] has suggested that Jameson hates Spider-Man mainly because he acts outside the law.<ref name="SSM175">''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #175</ref> A psychiatrist suggests that it is the mask that bothers him, and that when Jameson sees people who "claimed to be heroes, but covered their faces", he is subconsciously sure that they're hiding a horrible secret like his foster father was.<ref name=autogenerated8>''Spider-man's Tangled Web'' #20</ref> While interviewing Spider-Man years later, Jameson says that he used to think that he was jealous, or worried about children endangering themselves by following the hero's example, but says that the mask is why he dislikes Spider-Man.<ref name="SpideyInterview" />

Though Jonah's rancor against Spider-Man at times subsides after he saves the life of one of his loved ones,<ref name="SSM175"/> his determination to find some flaw in the hero always returns before long. For his part, Spider-Man's reaction ranges from frustration and anger at the ungrateful publisher, which leads to occasional pranks to antagonize him, to an amused acceptance of his self-destructive stubbornness.

Jameson posts rewards for Spider-Man's capture or secret identity, hunts him with [[Spencer Smythe]]'s [[Spider-Slayer]] [[robot]]s,<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #25 and 58</ref> and even commissions superpowered agents to defeat the masked man.<ref name="back91foe"/> He hires a private detective named MacDonald Gargan, puts him through a regimen of genetic enhancement, and transforms him into the [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]] - only to have Gargan go insane and turn on his benefactor.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #20</ref> Although Spider-Man protects Jameson from the Scorpion, Jameson keeps his role in creating the Scorpion secret for years. He creates another superbeing, who turned into a supervillain, the [[Human Fly (comics)|Human Fly]], who had his own vendetta against him.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #10</ref> He hires [[Silver Sable]] and her Wild Pack to hunt Spider-Man down, and also hires [[Luke Cage]] to capture Spider-Man when he is wanted for the deaths of [[Gwen Stacy]] and [[Norman Osborn]]. On another occasion, he offers [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] a five-thousand-dollar reward (1970 dollars, worth $19,300.00 today<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-the-value-of-a-dollar-today-3306105 | title=Why the Dollar is Worth So Much Less Than It Used to be}}</ref>) to mount a surprise attack against Spider-Man during a television interview.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #82</ref>

Though best known for his crusades against vigilante superheroes like Spider-Man, Jameson never hesitates to use the power of his paper against supervillains, crooked politicians, and crime bosses, including the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]].<ref name = "ASpM52">''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #50-52</ref><ref>''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' #230-231</ref> (In fact, the Kingpin's attempt to silence Jameson, and Spider-Man's attempt to rescue him, are central plot-elements in the Kingpin's very first appearance.<ref name = "ASpM52"/>) After initially supporting Sam Bullitt, a candidate for New York Attorney General who had pledged to arrest Spider-Man if elected, Jameson reverses his stance after learning that Bullitt is a racist crook.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man #91''</ref> He publishes a major exposé on mayoral candidate Randolf Cherryh's criminal ties, acknowledging in advance that a retaliatory lawsuit from Cherryh could bankrupt the ''Daily Bugle''.<ref>''Daredevil'' #177-178</ref> Jameson later takes an aggressive stance against presidential candidate [[Graydon Creed]], attacking him for his anti-mutant agenda and investigating the shadowy [[Operation: Zero Tolerance]], though he never manages to uncover the truth. He is also a longtime crusader for civil rights, having expressed disgust for racial prejudice on several occasions and has also campaigned for labor and mutant rights.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

===Family ties===
In ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #162 (November 1976), Jameson introduces himself to Dr. Marla Madison, a distinguished scientist and daughter of a deceased friend of his. He asks for her help in creating a new Spider-Slayer, one of a series of robots created to defeat Spider-Man, although Spider-Man has managed to survive their attacks and destroy each of them. Madison is interested in the challenge, and joins Jameson in his efforts.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=176}}</ref> The two grow closer, eventually marrying but not without another attack from the Scorpion, who kidnaps Marla and is defeated by Spider-Man.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #18</ref> Jameson remains a devoted, if a little overprotective, husband to his second wife.

Marla Madison [[adopt]]s [[Mattie Franklin]], her niece and the daughter of one of Jonah's friends. Though Jonah is initially opposed to having a roguish teenager in his house, especially one who insists on affectionately calling him "Unca Jonah",<ref>''Spider-Woman'' vol. 3 #3</ref> he soon warms up to Mattie, coming to regard her almost as a surrogate daughter.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' vol. 3 #12 and 18</ref><ref name="Al20">''[[Alias (comics)|Alias]]'' #20</ref> Two weeks after Mattie is abducted for illegal harvesting of mutant growth hormone, private investigators [[Jessica Drew]] and [[Jessica Jones]] track her down and inform Jonah and Marla that Mattie is also the vigilante [[Spider-Woman]].<ref name="Al20"/> For saving Mattie, Jonah heavily promotes Jones' agency and later hires her as a reporter for the ''Bugle'''s new ''Pulse'' magazine.<ref>''Alias'' #16–21</ref>

===Relinquishing control===
The guilt for creating the Scorpion catches up with Jameson when the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]] blackmails him about it. When he receives the threats, rather than succumb to the Hobgoblin, Jameson chooses instead to reveal it to the world in a public [[editorial]]. He steps down as the ''Bugle'''s editor-in-chief, delegating the post to his immediate subordinate, [[Robbie Robertson (comics)|Joseph "Robbie" Robertson]], but Jameson remains its publisher.

Jonah's control of the ''Daily Bugle'' is bought out from under him by multimillionaire [[Puma (comics)|Thomas Fireheart]]. Fireheart had felt that he owed Spider-Man a debt of honor and in an attempt to repay the hero, he purchases the ''Daily Bugle''<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #156</ref> and begins a pro-Spider-Man campaign.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #59</ref> Jameson starts up a rival magazine which continues to produce anti-Spider-Man articles.<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #159</ref><ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #65</ref> Spider-Man finds Fireheart's campaign embarrassing at best, and after he repeatedly demands that he stop, Fireheart challenges the web-slinger to a battle to the death in New Mexico. He then sells the ''Bugle'' back to Jameson for the sum of one dollar, on the condition that he print an obituary "For either me, or Spider-Man".<ref>''Peter Parker, The Spectacular-Spider-Man'' #171</ref> Jameson, though shocked by the request, takes the deal.

He is blackmailed into selling the ''Bugle'' to [[Norman Osborn]] after threats were made against his family; simultaneously, he is attacked and hounded by the supervillain [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)#Mad Jack(s)|Mad Jack]]. The time spent as a subordinate to Osborn took a heavy mental toll, almost driving him to attempted murder, but he is finally able to reclaim the ''Bugle'' after Osborn is driven underground by temporary insanity.

==="Death"===
When a duplicate of Spider-Man created by [[Mysterio]] jumps in front of Jameson's car while he is driving home from work one day, Jameson crashes his car into a tree. He is believed to have been killed in the car crash, dying upon impact, and the media blames Spider-Man for his tragic and untimely demise. Later, he is shown ascending to "the light", only for him to be condemned for all the injustices he committed in life. He is then shown descending into Mysterio's staged version of Hell, where he is tormented by a Spider-Man-themed demon, though this is revealed to just be a part of Mysterio's revenge on Jameson, but Spider-Man rescues him.<ref>''Webspinners: Tales of Spider-Man'' (1999) #1–3 (January–March 1999)</ref>

===Spider-Man unmasked===
Jameson's influence on the paper as its publisher is shown in the 2006–2007 ''[[Civil War: Front Line]]'' when he pressures his staff into supporting the federal government's [[Registration acts (comics)|Superhuman Registration Act]], still directing the general tone of the paper, despite losing his more hands-on position.<ref>{{cite web| title= Of Civil Wars and Sidekicks: Jenkins Talks CIVIL WAR: FRONT LINE and SIDEKICK|website=Comic Book Resources| url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=6952|access-date=March 22, 2006 }}</ref> When Spider-Man unmasks and reveals himself to be Peter Parker, Jameson faints in shock at the realization that the man he had been calling a menace had actually been on his payroll for years. On top of the Parker revelation, Jameson is forced to deal with the notion that [[She-Hulk]] had now become his daughter-in-law. This was not helped by the fact that She-Hulk and Spider-Man had previously sued him for libel.

[[File:CIVWARJJJ.jpg|right|thumb|Jameson's reaction to the unmasking of Spider-Man as seen through the reflection on a television]]
It has been since revealed that Jameson had always believed that between him and Peter Parker was a bond of trust and he had always regarded him as another son, the "last honest man" in the world; he had always bought his photos, even the ones that he considered inferior, to help him in a discreet manner. After Peter's public confession, Jameson feels so betrayed and humiliated that it shatters their bond. He is determined to make Peter "pay", despite Parker (as enforcer) and Jameson both actively supporting the [[Registration Acts (comics)|Superhuman Registration Act]]. He plans to sue Parker for fraud, demanding back all the money he paid Peter over the years. However, he learns that the government has granted Parker amnesty for all the acts he had done to protect his secret identity, which included taking photos of himself.<ref>''She-Hulk'' #9</ref> Both this and his son's marriage to She-Hulk drive Jameson into a fit of rage, and he attacks his new daughter-in-law with the original [[Spider-Slayer]]. She easily destroys it, and to smooth things over, remarks that she will handle the lawsuit for fraud against Spider-Man (while privately intending to drag it out as long as possible).

Spider-Man later defects from the government's side in enforcing the Registration Act and joins with [[Captain America]]'s Secret Avengers, openly rebelling against the new law and fighting those attempting to enforce it. Issues of ''Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man'' reveal that Jameson posted a reward to bring in Peter. He also commits libel against Parker by coercing Peter's old girlfriend [[Debra Whitman]] into writing an untrue account of him; [[Betty Brant]] has secretly supplied information about this to ''The Daily Globe'', which then published a front-page exposé.

In the most recent development, Jameson's editor-in-chief and closest friend [[Robbie Robertson (comics)|Robbie Robertson]] stands up to Jameson and his shoddy treatment of Peter/Spider-Man over the years. Unable or unwilling to admit that he has gone too far in his hatred of Spider-Man, Jameson fires Robertson. Later, Spider-Man learns of this from Betty Brant and decides that he and Jameson should have a long overdue "chat". Some time later, Jameson visits the Robertson house with a bottle of wine, two black eyes, and a broken hand. He tells Robbie that he discovered his office at the ''Bugle'' covered with webbing, with a note attached telling him to meet Spider-Man at an old gangster lair. Spider-Man tried to persuade Jameson to rehire Robbie, and Jameson gave him a choice: to have the lawsuit against him dropped, or for Robbie to be rehired. Spider-Man chose the former, revealing that he did so because he believes Jameson only fired Robbie to get a rise out of him. Spider-Man then told Jameson to hit him, as many times as he'd like, to finally work out his frustrations. Jameson was initially reluctant, until Spider-Man started goading him, threatening to inform his wife and son of his "cowardice". Jameson snapped, and started hitting Spider-Man again and again and again, resulting in his broken hand. When it was over, Spider-Man went into the rafters and brought Jameson back a roll of film, containing pictures of their "fight", telling him the photographs depicting him standing back and letting Jameson beat him up would sell "a [[gazillion]] copies", and left. Later, at the ''Bugle'', Jameson crushed the film with his foot, not knowing quite why he was doing it. As he turned to leave, Betty Brant accidentally hit him in the face with a door, resulting in his two black eyes. Back in the present, Jameson tells Robbie of his decision to rehire him and to drop the lawsuit against Peter.

===Heart attacks and recuperation===
Jameson has his first heart attack, a mild one, in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #70, while being threatened by Spider-Man when the latter finally loses his temper after many years of abuse and defamation.

After the status quo was revised in the "[[Spider-Man: Brand New Day|Brand New Day]]" storyline, Peter's identity is once again a secret. ''The Daily Bugle'' has hit hard times with Peter not selling as many Spider-Man pictures as usual and star reporter [[Ben Urich]] gone. These circumstances led to Jonah facing a buyout from the wealthy [[Dexter Bennett]]. This forced Jonah to stop everyone's checks to build the capital needed to save the paper, with everyone at the ''Bugle'' working temporarily for free as a sign of solidarity. Needing money for an apartment, Peter came to the ''Bugle'' claiming he was owed money, to which Jonah yelled at him, causing Peter to snap and yell back, stating that his photographs kept the ''Bugle'' selling while Jonah raked in the profits and paid Peter a pittance. This caused Jonah to yell at Peter again, but he stopped short owing to a second heart attack.{{issue|date=August 2014}}

Peter spent an unknown period of time giving Jonah [[CPR]] to try and save him until the paramedics arrived; upon arriving they rushed Jonah to the hospital where he was depicted resting before surgery. His wife began talking to a lawyer about power of attorney and selling the final shares of the ''Bugle'' without Jonah having a say. When Peter, as Spider-Man, paid a visit, he accidentally let slip that the ''Daily Bugle'' has sold to Dexter Bennett, which caused Jonah to have another heart attack, forcing Spider-Man to once again give him CPR. Surprisingly, Jonah did not blame Spider-Man for once, but instead he just kept on muttering, "Dexter Bennett".{{issue|date=August 2014}}

Jonah's condition later improved, to the point where he takes physiotherapy sessions and [[T'ai chi ch'uan|t'ai chi]] classes. However, he loses his temper if he sees or hears about Dexter Bennett and the ''D.B.'' He is also apparently facing problems with his wife, as he has yet to forgive her for selling the ''Bugle''.{{issue|date=August 2014}}

===Mayor of New York===
In a 2009 storyline, Jameson is elected the [[Mayor of New York City]]<ref>[[Slott, Dan]] (w), [[Delperdang, Jesse]]; [[Eaglesham, Dale]]; [[Kitson, Barry]] (a), "'Nuff Said!", ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #591. June 2009. Marvel Comics.</ref> Spider-Man is in another dimension with the Fantastic Four, resulting in a month going by on Earth while they are only away for a few hours. In his new office, Jonah receives a visit from his estranged father, J. Jonah Jameson Sr., demanding that Jonah cease his vendetta against Spider-Man - the reasons being Spider-Man's many heroic deeds and the fact that the Avengers and even Captain America had accepted Spider-Man. Spider-Man then enters the mayor's office (hoping to establish a truce with Jameson) only for Jonah to announce that he has assembled an "Anti-Spider Squad" to capture Spider-Man. Spider-Man responds by taking his superhero work into overdrive, committing heroic deeds all over the city simply to enrage Jameson. Jameson responds by putting his squad on double-shifts, severely straining the city council's budget.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #592</ref>

In the "[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]" storyline, with Norman's rise to power, [[Dark Avengers]] member [[Mac Gargan|Spider-Man]] (really Mac Gargan) seeks to get revenge on Jameson. When Jameson arrived at his home, he was shocked to find a dead stripper on his bed.<ref>''Dark Reign: Sinister Spider-Man'' #1</ref> When Gargan starts a gang war, Jameson goes to Osborn to help and is given "Spider-Man". He later discovers this Spider-Man has caused the gang war and tries to confront Norman, though Spider-Man's name is cleared when he appears to save the Big Apple Festival from [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]], [[Daken]], and the gangs involved. Jameson's popularity jumps from having worked with Spider-Man to solve the problem, though he does not realize during the course of the events that he is dealing with a different Spider-Man.<ref>''Dark Reign: Sinister Spider-Man'' #2–4</ref>

Jameson also eventually learns that his father is marrying [[Aunt May|May Parker]], something he personally does not like. But, he begrudgingly accepts it in the end. He even offers to pay for their ceremony out of his own pocket, and preside over it. The marriage also technically makes him Peter Parker's brother/cousin, something he very clearly dislikes.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #600</ref>

Later, Spider-Man tries to stop the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] from setting off a bomb that would kill thousands. Jameson has his squad wearing [[Mandroid]] suits to attack Spider-Man. But, Spider-Man cleverly uses his knowledge of the Mandroid suits to disarm the bomb instead. The squad decide not to follow their orders to arrest Spider-Man. Instead, they let him go. The next day, Jameson is shocked to learn that every member of the squad has resigned, and his aide tells him that Jonah is getting out of control, and that Spider-Man's heroics do not deserve a criminal's treatment. When Jameson yells about how much the public has to see Spider-Man as a menace, the aide snaps that this was not the ''Daily Bugle''. The aide then turns in his own resignation, telling Jameson that he has to choose between Spider-Man or actually helping the city.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #604</ref>

Jameson later gives a financial bailout to Dexter Bennett to keep the ''Bugle'' afloat. This leads to a public backlash which the villain [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] uses to his advantage. Electro espouses taking down the ''Bugle''. He sees it as a greedy corporation, and draws energy from his citywide supporters by turning on all their electrical appliances. In a showdown with Spider-Man inside the ''Daily Bugle'' building, Dexter Bennett is crushed by rubble, and the building is completely destroyed. The destruction of the ''Bugle's'' longtime headquarters proves heartbreaking for Jameson, who is upset with his life's work, and all of his memories, being destroyed.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #614</ref>

During Spider-Man's encounter with the latest [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]] in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #623–624, it is falsely stated by a mob boss that Jameson was responsible for his creation in order to get that Vulture to attack Jameson.

===''Spider-Man: Life Story''===
Jameson appeared in the miniseries ''Spider-Man: Life Story'', which explores how Spider-Man and the Marvel Universe at large would be if it were not set in a floating timeline. In the first issue, set in the 1960s, Jameson is shown to be under stress from the police due to their investigation into his involvement with the creation of the Spider-Slayers and [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]], resulting in him berating and mistreating his staff more than usual.<ref>''Spider-Man: Life Story'' #1</ref> In the fifth issue, it is revealed that Jameson died shortly before [[September 11 attacks|9-11]], and Peter Parker was attending his funeral during the incident, leaving to help in the rescue efforts.<ref>''Spider-Man: Life Story'' #5</ref>

Jameson's life in this continuity is explored in the annual. In 1966, he is arrested by George Stacy after Scorpion confessed to Jameson's role in his creation. He befriends Norman Osborn and begins writing a memoir. His vendetta against Spider-Man pushes away anyone close to him, including his son and Parker as he continues to insist the wall-crawler is a menace. During his prison term, he mostly confides with the prison therapist, Helen Carroll, who is secretly a clone of Gwen Stacy trying to help other 'victims' of costumed heroes. In 2001, Jameson is finally released from prison and follows the deceased Norman's instructions to a warehouse, where he finds an upgraded version of the Spider-Slayer suit. Rather than get revenge on Spider-Man, he uses it to take out the Scorpion as he saw the villain as his greatest mistake. He dies shortly after killing Gargan. At his funeral, Helen gives Peter Jameson's completed memoir: "Webs: Untangling A Life".<ref>''Spider-Man: Life Story'' Annual #1</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
* J. Jonah Jameson appears in the 1960s ''[[Spider-Man (1967 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' series, voiced by [[Paul Kligman]]. This version is an egotistical, greedy, and cowardly braggart who constantly berates his employees and automatically accuses Spider-Man of any crime, even when the evidence contradicts him. While he maintains these traits throughout the series, the season two [[prequel]] episode "King Pinned" portrays Jameson's attitude toward Spider-Man as being originally warmer, even going as far as to stand up to the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]], help the web-slinger defeat him, and expose the Kingpin's drug counterfeiting racket during their first meeting.
* J. Jonah Jameson appears in the 1970s live-action ''[[Spider-Man (1977 film)|Spider-Man]]'' made-for-television pilot film and the subsequent ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (TV series)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' TV series, portrayed by [[David White (actor)|David White]] and [[Robert F. Simon]] respectively. Both versions of Jameson's abrasive, flamboyant personality are toned down as he is portrayed as a more avuncular figure.

* J. Jonah Jameson appears in the 1990s ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' series, voiced by [[Ed Asner]]. This version's dislike of Spider-Man is based less on his powers and deeds and more on his hiding his identity behind a mask as his wife was killed by a masked gunman. The series also portrays his integrity as a journalist as he refuses to cover up the truth even when it is in his best interests and demonstrates loyalty to his employees.

K. Simmons]]' [[J. Jonah Jameson (film character)|version]]. Aside from these traits, he retains his dislike of Spider-Man, though he displays a fondness for Peter Parker, and maintains his cynical, avuncular, brusque attitude with his staff.

==== Raimi films ====

Simmons portrays Jameson in Raimi's ''Spider-Man'' film trilogy. This version serves as major source of [[comic relief]] throughout the films, being portrayed as a blustering, bombastic, obsessed, and hyperactive man retaining his dislike for [[Peter Parker (Sam Raimi film series)|Spider-Man]] and taking delight in anything that might discredit or defame him, but remaining a good man at his core.
