Queef Sisters?! You replaced our show with this?! But they aren't funny! All they do is queef all the time! Because babies come from there! Brian, don't do this! Very nice place you have here. Network must be paying you well. All right, enough with the queefing! We didn't come for a social call! Because you've reduced Canada Channel to smut and toilet humor! Your idols?  Because I'm suddenly finding myself strangely attracted to Katherine. AAH!  No, that was me, Phillip. I farted. Phillip?! I'm Terrance! Could you please keep it down? We're trying to have sex over here. SICK! What?! Gross!  After everything we've been through?   What the hell am I going to do, Phillip? She makes me so mad sometimes. Katie, I'm sorry. I was wrong.
