Ah-ah-ah-I'm afraid Kyle can't ride any amusement park rides for over a year because of his horrible hemorrhoid. Kyle, don't say such things! Kyle, we wanna tell you about the Book of Job. It's a story from the Bible.  But one day, Satan went up to Heaven and talked to God. Yes, in the Book of Job, Satan talks to God. And God says to Satan, "Have you seen Job? He is a great man, and he praises me every day." To which God said, "Oh yeah? I'll show you, Satan! I'll take those things away from Job and he will still praise my name." Then God sent his fireballs from the sky and killed his sheep and the rest of his employees.  Job was terribly sad, but he fell to his knees and said, "The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away," and praised God's name.  He was in terrible, miserable pain all day, every day. But he still kept his faith.  Basically. Isn't he getting any better, doctor?  Get the doctor! But then... are you saying...?  Oh Kyle! Kyle, you've got to fight!  That's it, baby. That's it.
