South Park Elementary, day. Kyle is speaking to the school in the school gym, which is nicely decorated in the flags of many nations, both on the rafters and on the small stage set up at one end of the basketball court.

Kyle

[wearing an argyle sweater] ...And in conclusion, the Latino community has provided America, and indeed, the entire world with innovations that we would be lost without. And that is my presentation on the role of Hispanics in American technology. Thank you. [cheers from the school crowd before him]

Principal Victoria

[approaches the mic] Okay, thank you, Kyle Broflovski.

Mr. Mackey

[as Kyle approaches him] That was very good, Kyle. I think the Latino Endowment Council was very happy with your presentation. Looks like you might win. [a shot of the council, which is comprised of five Latinos. ]

Kyle

Cool.

Principal Victoria

All right, students, members of the school board. Our last speaker will discuss the important role of Latinos in the arts. Here is... Eric Cartman. [reads again in disbelief] Eric Cartman? [a smattering of applause from the kids in the crowd]

Cartman

[approaches the mic with his left hand behind his back] Thank you. The Latino culture has been very influential on the arts in America. But you don't have to ask me. You can ask my special guest. Miss Jennifer Lopez.

Kids

Jennifer Lopez?

Kyle

No way.

Cartman

[shows off his left hand, which is open] Miss Lopez, come on out here. [the hand closes to become a fist, and that fist has a face and hair painted on it]

Cartman as Jennifer Lopez

[Cartman begins to speak in a Spanish cartoon accent and his lips form a tiny smile as his hand begins to move] Hallooo. [the hand sports a small wig and a paper cutout of a woman's body hanging down from it. The cutout wears a white top and shorts and a heavy brown coat. The cutout's right hand sports some yellow bracelets]

Principal Victoria

[taken aback] Oh, Jesus Christ.

Cartman as Jennifer Lopez

My name is Hennifer Lopez. I eat tacos, y burritos.

Cartman

Ms. Lopez, would you like to talk about Latinos and the arts?

Cartman as Jennifer Lopez

Oh si, si. But first I would like to put on my pretty dress.

Cartman

Oh, you mean this one? [whips out a doll's dress for the occasion]

Cartman as Jennifer Lopez

Oh si si si. I like it very much.

Cartman

[fits the dress under his hand] There we go, Saright?

Cartman as Jennifer Lopez

Saright.

Cartman

That's a very pretty dress. [the Latino Endowment Council is shown again]

Cartman as Jennifer Lopez

It better be! I am Hennifer Lopez!

A Council Member

Cartman

Ms. Lopez, could you show everyone your example of Latino arts?

Cartman as Jennifer Lopez

Don't be fooled by all my money. I still like to eat tacos, honey. So crispy on the outside, so super good and yummy.

Cartman

And that is my presentation on Latinos in the arts. Thank you. [Much more cheer and applause for him. The school gives him a standing ovation. The members of the Latino Endowment council jump up and down with joy and pride. Stan and Kenny clap with everyone else, Kyle is just stunned.]

+++++


South Park Mall, later. The boys walk down one side inside the mall. Cartman leads the way.

Cartman

Oh-hoh man! A twenty-dollar gift certificate at the mall! I can buy whatever I want! Cultural Diversity Day kicks ass!

Kyle

It isn't fair. I spent weeks preparing my speech on Latino culture.

Cartman

Hey, I spent weeks preparing too, Kyle.

Kyle

No you didn't, asshole! What you did was totally stupid and racist! And you only did it to screw me over!

Cartman

[walks up to Kyle] Awww, I don't think Kyle likes you, Ms. Lopez.

Cartman as Jennifer Lopez

Aww, that makes me muy triste.

Cartman

Ms. Lopez, do you like Kyle?

Cartman as Jennifer Lopez

Oh si si, very much.

Cartman

Ms. Lopez, would you like to give Kyle a kiss?

Cartman as Jennifer Lopez

Oh si, si si, my kisses taste like tacos. [Cartman plants his fist on Kyle's lips and makes kissing noises, then removes the hand]

Cartman

Is nice?

Cartman as Jennifer Lopez

Is very nice. He's so handsome. [Cartman puts the hand back on Kyle's mouth and resumes the kissing noises]

Kyle

[swats Cartman's hand away]Stop it!

Cartman

Hey, come one guys! We can use part of my gift certificate to buy food at the food court.

Kenny

(Woohoo!) [the boys go to the food court]

+++++


South Park Mall, later. The boys walk down the mall. Cartman's hand is finishing off a taco as he looks at it.

Cartman as Jennifer Lopez

Mmm, tacos! So yummy!

Kyle

Stop wasting the tacos on your hand, Cartman!

Cartman

Hey, Ms. Lopez has to eat, too.

Kyle

She's not eating it, it's just coming out her backside!

Cartman as Jennifer Lopez

When you eat a taco it comes out your backside too, cholo!

Kenny

(Heheehee, heheh yeahah)

Cartman as Jennifer Lopez

Look look! Make your own music video! [they stop in front of a "U R Da Star", a music-video shop]

Kyle

Nonono, we're not going into one of those cheesy places, Cartman!

Cartman

I agree. Those places are stupid.

Cartman as Jennifer Lopez

It's not stupid. I need to make music video.

Stan

[to Cartman's hand] Look, we're not going in there, so just-! Wait, why the hell am I talking to your hand? [slaps Cartman's hand down] Look, we're not going in there, so just knock it off!

Cartman

Hey, I'm on your guys' side.

Cartman as Jennifer Lopez

[rises] Just wait one minute, let me see how much it is. [leads Cartman in. Stan and Kenny follow]

Kyle

God dammit! [follows reluctantly]

Michael

Welcome to Make Your Own Video. All set to rock and roll?

Cartman as Jennifer Lopez

How much to make a video?

Michael

Uh, well, it's nine ninety five for a three-minute tape.

Cartman

Heh! We're not paying nine ninety five!

Cartman as Jennifer Lopez

Oh please! Come on, guys!

Kyle

Cartman, will you stop this gayness?!

Cartman

All right all right, here's ten dollars! [takes out the bill and hands it to the cashier]

Kyle

That's not what I meant!

Michael

All right, just come over here and stand in front of the green screen. [Cartman walks over to the screen] What kind of song do you want?

Cartman as Jennifer Lopez

Something hot and spicy.

The cashier puts on various music tracks, first song is a rock song.

Cartman as Jennifer Lopez

Jennifer Lopez

Don' you forget what'll happen to you, ho! Come on, Benny!

She drags him off, but he glances back at the new Jennifer Lopez. He follows the original Lopez into the limousine, looking back one more time. As the limo leaves, Ben looks back one more time with his hands up against the glass as if blowing a kiss. The crowd then disperses.

Kyle

Well, there you go, fatass! I hope you learned your lesson.

Cartman

Yeah. I sure did. I don't think I should record that album now.

A soft song plays. The next scene is a dawn on a beach, where "Jennifer Lopez" and Ben run side by side. Cartman looks tired. Next is a restaurant where Ben has some wine while "Jennifer Lopez" enjoys a martini. Next scene, they're watching a movie together. "Jennifer Lopez" has her own seat between Ben and Cartman. Bem stretches and puts his hand on the headrest behind "Jennifer Lopez". Cartman looks, then looks away angrily. Next scene is at a jewelry store, where Ben picks out some earrings for "Jennifer Lopez". "Jennifer Lopez" opens her mouth in delight and Ben smiles. Next scene, Ben is resting on Cartman's lap and chatting with "Jennifer Lopez". Again, Cartman looks away in disgust.

Cartman as Jennifer Lopez

Yes! Oh yes, Ben, kiss me! [Cartman looks in wonder as his hand gets a mind of its own]

Ben

Mmm, just like tacos.

Taco-flavored kisses for my Ben.

Ben

You're so hot, baby.

Kyle's house, day. He, Stan and Kenny watch TV on the couch. The doorbell rings.

Kyle

Come in. [the bell rings again.] COME IN!! [Cartman enters wearing an oven mitt over his left hand.]

Cartman

[sad] Guys, I need to talk to you.

Stan

What's the matter?

Cartman

I can't handle it anymore. All the fame and the Ben Affleck spooge, I... I just can't go on living with Ms. Lopez.

Kyle

So stop doing it!

Cartman

Stop doing what?

Kyle

You know God-damn well what! Now get outta here!

Cartman

Please, you guys. It's like, I can't even have a moment to myself anymore. See? [removes the oven mitt and "Jennifer Lopez" emerges coughing]

Cartman as Jennifer Lopez

Don't you dare ever do that to me again!

Kyle

Aw, stop it, Cartman! Your hand doesn't need to breathe!

Cartman as Jennifer Lopez

You try being in an oven mitt for two hours!

Kyle

I can see your lips moving!

Cartman as Jennifer Lopez

I can see your lips moving too, culo!

Kyle

See?! I just saw your lips move!

Cartman

Look! I'm just asking you guys for help. Will you please help me with Ms. Lopez.

Stan

What's she doing?

Kyle

Come here! [drags Stan off to the dining room] You're not actually buying this crap, are you?!

Stan

I don't know, meh, maybe he can't help it.

Kyle

Look, he knows full well what he's doing, and he's just waiting for us to buy into it, and then he'll laugh and point at our faces and say, [Kyle does a pretty solid impression of Cartman] "Haha, I got you guys to believe me!" "You guys are stupid!"

Stan

Dude, do you really he would go through all this just to make us look dumb?

Kyle

YES, dude! [they then walk back into the living room]

Stan

Cartman, we decided that if you can be mature and admit to everyone that you've gotten yourself into this mess, then we'll help you.

Cartman

Okay, okay, I know that I control everything Ms. Lopez does.

Cartman as Jennifer Lopez

Oh no you don't!

Cartman

Quiet, Ms. Lopez.

Kyle

Out! [walks off. Stan and Kenny follow him out]

Cartman

Guys... Uh... Uh... [dejected, he turns away and walks out the front door]

+++++


Outside, day. Cartman reaches the sidewalk when he sees something.

Ben

There you are, Jenny! I've been lookin' all over for you, baby! [Cartman decides to run in the other direction] Jenny? [Cartman sees a car pull up in front of him and then...]

Aide 1

Ms. Lopez, you were due in the studio two hours ago! Come on! [Cartman decides to ran back towards Ben, but runs into a pair of female legs]

Jennifer Lopez

[disheveled, wielding a running chainsaw over her head] So you're gettin' married, huh? [revs up the motor, and Cartman makes his escape, screaming. In the background, Stan, Kyle, and Kenny have stepped out the door to see what's going on.]

Ben

Don't you hurt her!

BHI President

We'll sue you!

Kyle

Oh Jesus.

+++++


A bridge over a wide river, day. Jennifer Lopez has followed Cartman here. Cartman screams. A police car pulls up from the other end of the bridge. The driver steps out, and both officers draw their guns at Jennifer Lopez, now unrecognizable.

Police officer 1

Freeze, leafblower! [she drops the chainsaw and holds her hands up]

Aide 1

Arrest that woman! She wants to kill one of our artists! [the arrest is made]

Police officer 2

All right, you're going downtown, bean-breath.

Ben

[rushes up to "Jennifer Lopez"] Jenny! Oh, I thought I was going to lose you! Let's run away and get married tonight!

Aide 2

Hey, she can't get married tonight, she has a recording session! [Stan, Kyle, and Kenny arrive]

Ben

Our love is like rain!

Jennifer Lopez

That's what you said about me, asshole!

Cartman as Jennifer Lopez

Quiet!

BHI President

Get her out of here!

Jennifer Lopez

Fuck you!

Police officer 2

Shut up, picante pants!

Cartman as Jennifer Lopez

Everyone be quiet! [Everyone stops what they're doing and look at the hand] I'm... I'm not who you think I am.

BHI President

You're not?

Cartman as Jennifer Lopez

No. It was all a lie. A lie I cannot continue anymore. I am not Hennifer Lopez. I am... [Cartman rips off the small wig he had on his hand and delivers a new voice] ...Mitch Conner. [everyone, including Kyle, gasps]

Police officer 2

Who's Mitch Conner?

Mitch Conner

Just your run of the mill con man. I've been moving from town to town, scamming people since I was fifteen. But I'm tired of runnin'.

Kyle

[exasperated] Oh no, no, no.

Mitch Conner

I've been a cheat all my life. And now I've ruined a singer's career, lost a record company millions, and cost this little boy his precious time.

Kyle

Stop. It.

Mitch Conner

Mostly, I'm sorry to you, Ben. I'm sorry I played Tiddly Winks with your heart. [Ben begins to sob. Cartman walks to one side of the bridge] But it's over now. The cyanide pill I took should be taking effect very soon. Hmph, looks like the sun is goin' down. I wonder, will I dream? [as the sun drops below the horizon, Cartman opens his hand and a gust of wind is heard. Whatever was possessing the hand parted. Ben sobs once more as Cartman just stares in wonder]

Police officer 2

Well, looks like Mitch Conner has cashed in his last chips. [everyone disperses except the boys. Ben stays on for a second, but he too leaves.]

Kyle

[the boys step forward] Dude, who the hell is Mitch Conner?

Cartman

I don't know, Kyle, all right? Look, I don't care what you guys believe. But with all the crazy stuff that goes on in this town, isn't it possible, just possible, that something I don't understand happened here?

Kyle

[resigns] All right. [Cartman beams] All right, I guess it's possible.

Cartman

[dances back to the other three boys] Hahahahahaaaha! [into Kyle's face] I got you kinda! I got you kinda!

A fast-food Mexican Restaurant, La Taco. People are enjoying their food, one person is waiting for his order, and there are employees behind the counter. One of them looks familiar.

Manager

Okay, Ms. Lopez, over here we have the toppings station. This is where all your cheeses and lettuce will go on. [a man carrying a large bowl walks up behind Lopez and bumps into her]

Jennifer Lopez

[jumping to one side] Ow. Look out, muffinhead!

Manager

Ahh, look, Ms. Lopez, uh, if you're gonna be a member of the La Taco family, you're gonna have to learn to get along with people.

Jennifer Lopez

Get a what with who?

Manager

Uh why don't you start chopping those onions and I'll come check on you a little later?

Jennifer Lopez

[begins chopping the onions] This is bullshit! How the fuck did I end up working at a La Taco?! I had six platinum records and I starred in five Hollywood movies!

Coworker

Yeah. Meee too.

Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
