 Gotta get down factory before the bell!  What the fook are we doin', anyway? Breakin' our backs! Loadin' up forklifts! Gettin' paper cuts from boxes! And for what?! A measly paycheck that just barely covers our online purchases. We had our dignity! It was the bloody machines! Ya can't do it, Stotch! Ya damned us all! If those orders get fulfilled, then we got nothin'! My son's in the bike parade too!  He's got... little tassels off the back of his seat. Tiny flags stickin' out the handlebars. But he deserves more, Stotch! If we don't make our stand now, he doesn't have a chance. He'll get fookin' third or fourth place or just a fookin' participation ribbon! Stotch! And if others try to break through the picket line?
