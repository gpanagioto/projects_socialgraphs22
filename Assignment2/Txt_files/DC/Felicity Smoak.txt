==Fictional character biography==

===The Fury of Firestorm===
[[File:Felicity Smoak (Fury of Firestorm).jpg|left|upright|thumb|Felicity Smoak in ''The Fury of Firestorm''.]]Portrayed as the supervisor of a New York computer software firm in her 1984 debut appearance,<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Gerry Conway]]|artist=[[Rafael Kayanan]]|title=The Fury of Firestorm|issue=#23|date=January 10, 1984|publisher="[[DC Comics]]"}}</ref> Felicity first meets Firestorm in the course of one of his battles with a villain, where he inadvertently magnetizes and effectively destroys several of the computers storing the software programs in development. This results in millions of dollars in property damage, which threatens to ruin the software firm and leads to a heated confrontation between Felicity and Firestorm where she threatened to organize a class action lawsuit against him. Felicity would make recurring appearance, often taking an adversarial role against Firestorm and making a point of explaining what the collateral damage of his battles cost her and other civilians. On one occasion, a frustrated Firestorm lashes out against Felicity's confrontational behavior by using his molecular transmutation powers to transform her clothes to soap suds, a tactic he previously used on the supervillain [[Plastique (comics)|Plastique]]. Humiliated from being rendered nude in public, Felicity retaliates by filing a lawsuit against him.

At some point, Felicity develops a romantic relationship with Ed Raymond. She has no idea that Ed's son Ronnie is the other half of Firestorm. When Ronald discovers that Felicity is seeing his father, he is uncertain how to treat her due to their past interactions. Over time, Felicity and Ed fall deeply in love and are married. After the wedding Felicity learns the truth about Ronnie's secret dual identity, but by this point she had forgiven him for his past transgressions, although she would still insist on reminding him about the importance of using his superpowers in a responsible manner.<ref>[http://comicvine.gamespot.com/felicity-smoak/4005-2541/ "Felicity Smoak"] "Comicvine", Retrieved January 17, 2017.</ref>

===The New 52===
DC Comics rebooted its comic properties in 2011 as part of a relaunch entitled [[The New 52]], which led to the character of Felicity Smoak being brought back in a fashion similar to the version seen on ''Arrow''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/2014/10/02/felicity-smoak-joins-the-new-52-and-shes-the-arrow-version/|title=Felicity Smoak joins the New 52 - and she's the 'Arrow' version|last=Burlingame|first=Russ|work=comicbook.com|date=October 2, 2014|access-date=January 17, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141104080327/http://comicbook.com/2014/10/02/felicity-smoak-joins-the-new-52-and-shes-the-arrow-version|archive-date=November 4, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> The New 52 version of Felicity Smoak is introduced in 2014 in ''Green Arrow'' #35, the first issue of that book to be written by ''Arrow'' showrunner [[Andrew Kreisberg]]. In #35,<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Ben Sokolowski]] & [[Andrew Kreisberg]]|artist=Daniel Sampere|title=[[Green Arrow]] (The New 52)|issue=#35|date=October 1, 2014|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}</ref> she is introduced in an end-of-issue cliffhanger as an assassin out to kill Oliver, but quickly explains that while she is a hacker-for-hire who has "done questionable things" in her past, "leading a hero to his death isn't one of them", explaining she did not know her target was the Green Arrow when she accepted the job. After proving her hacker credentials by explaining to him that she knows his secret identity, as well as highly specific details from his superhero, personal, professional and family lives, she offers to become a part of his team out of a desire to help him save the city. Surmising that whoever hired her to kill Oliver has extremely evil plans, she teams up with Green Arrow to track down her client's other target, a woman named [[Mia Dearden]], who they soon discover is being pursued by the deadly archer [[Merlyn (DC Comics)|Merlyn]].

Later in the same storyline, Felicity is arrested and placed in a Supermax facility for her many cybercrimes, where she shares a cell with [[Cheetah (comics)|Cheetah]]; it is established that Felicity had once been hired to [[doxing|dox]] Cheetah, putting the villain and her loved ones in added danger. Oliver saves her from Cheetah with some help from [[Steve Trevor]] of [[ARGUS (comics)|A.R.G.U.S.]] Ultimately, Oliver saves Mia from the man pursuing her and her father John King. Oliver also exposes him as a murderer who used bribery and corruption to control Seattle. Felicity is then invited by Trevor to join A.R.G.U.S., but appears to reject his offer in favor of working with Oliver.
