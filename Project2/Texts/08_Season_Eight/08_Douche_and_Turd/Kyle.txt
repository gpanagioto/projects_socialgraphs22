Wait. You guys, I have an awesome idea! We should secretly go around and tell all the students we can, to not check any of the mascots on this election sheet, and instead write in "Giant Douche." Turd Sandwich isn't better than Giant Douche. It was ''my'' idea and we're gonna tell everyone to write in "Giant Douche!" It's way funnier! Kenny, what's funnier? A giant douche or a turd sandwich? Stan, do you pick giant douche or turd sandwich?  That's two against one, 'cause Stan doesn't care. So it's giant douche. You ''hate'' Butters. You misled him, fatass! Jimmy, we're gonna have everyone write in a mascot that's really funny, and you have to tell us which one would be funnier. A giant douche. Giant douche. A giant douche. All right, it's decided. Let's all write in "Giant Douche." Cartman? What the hell?! You won't get more votes than us, asshole! Be sure to vote for Giant Douche. Giant Douche is your man! Dude, I'm not going to lose to Cartman's stupid turd sandwich.  There. Do you really want that asshole to win? What? Y-you gotta vote, dude. Haven't you seen the ''Rock the Vote'' stuff or, or Puff Daddy's ''Vote or Die''?! Kenny, we have got to make Stan understand the importance of voting, because he'll definitely vote for our guy. You're doing the right thing, Stan. Don't you feel like you're a part of something now? Look, it may not seem important now, but your vote really does count, and we all have to do our part. Woah... wait, what are you doing? No, no, you... you wrote down Turd Sandwich. ...Dude, you're supposed to vote for Giant Douche. Well yeah, but not if your decision is for Turd Sandwich! What the hell is wrong with you?! Well, I just figured you'd vote for ''my'' guy! Who's fuckin' friend are you?!  Puffy! Stan, don't you think this has gone far enough? Is it really that big a deal?  Yeah, just vote. For Giant Douche. Ha! You lose, fatass!
