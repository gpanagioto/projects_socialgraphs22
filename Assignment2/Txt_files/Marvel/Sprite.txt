Since 2019, Sprite has been depicted as alternatively male and female in comics (via the plot element of rebirth) due to their (then-unreleased) depiction as the latter in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU).<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":5" />

[[Lia McHugh]] portrayed Sprite in the 2021 MCU film ''[[Eternals (film)|Eternals]]'', with [[Hannah Dodd (actress)|Hannah Dodd]] portraying Sprite's illusionary adult form of "'''Sandra'''", and [[Salma Hayek]] portraying Sprite disguised as [[Ajak (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ajak]].

==Publication history==
{{expand section|date=July 2019}}
Sprite first appeared in ''[[Eternal (comics)|The Eternals]]'' #9 (March 1977), and was created by [[Jack Kirby]].

==Fictional character biography==
Sprite is an incorrigible [[trickster]] and practical joker, and has been for millennia. Claiming to have been the inspiration for [[William Shakespeare]] to write the character of [[Puck (Shakespeare)|Puck]] in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' and [[J. M. Barrie]] to write ''[[Peter Pan]]'', Sprite revels in what he sees as "playful" behavior, he is unmindful of the often deadly consequences of his "pranks", especially to fragile "mortal" humans. Though punished time and again for his murderous actions, he always returns to his preferred way of life after a while.

During the Fourth Host of the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]], when Zuras calls for the [[Uni-Mind]] to examine the Celestials' Mothership, Sprite remains behind with [[Domo (comics)|Domo]]'s Central Processor. There, he convinces the imprisoned [[Forgotten One (comics)|Forgotten Eternal]] to help stop an attack to the Celestial ship.<ref>''The Eternals'' #14. Marvel Comics.</ref>

While trying to improve [[Olympia (comics)|Olympia]]'s systems, Sprite accidentally sends Olympia into the [[Negative Zone]] once, but the Eternals are able to restore it to its proper place.<ref>''The Avengers'' #308–310. Marvel Comics.</ref> Sprite later advocates the appointment of the [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]] as [[Sersi]]'s ''Gann Josin'' (sharing a mental bond) as compromise with [[Ikaris]], who wants her killed.<ref>''The Avengers'' #361. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Reality change plan (''Eternals'' vol. 3)===
In the ''Eternals'' miniseries by Neil Gaiman, Sprite, under the "real name" of Colín, was the star of "''It's Just So Sprite''", a sitcom on the Tweenie Channel. Although he presented himself to be unaware of his past or abilities, he also served as a spokesman for Hero Registration (as the series is set during the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] event).<ref>''Eternals'' (vol. 3) #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

[[Ikaris]], who seemed to be the only Eternal with any memory of his past, sees Sprite on television and informs [[Makkari (comics)|Makkari]] that Sprite was another Eternal.<ref>''Eternals'' (vol. 3) #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Later, after Ikaris disappeared and the remaining Eternals started to recover their powers, Curry contacted Sprite, seeking advice. Sprite reveals that he had always known who they both were, and takes them to the [[Dreaming Celestial]], their creator. There, Sprite informs Curry that it was Sprite himself who made all the Eternals forget who they were, took away their powers, and removed all record of them from reality, as revenge for a million years of them treating him like a child and not allowing him to experience the vices of the world – to the extent that they created him as the Eternal 'who would never grow up', trapped in the form of a prepubescent child.<ref>''Eternals'' (vol. 4) #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Using the [[Uni-Mind]] powered by the Dreaming Celestial, Sprite uses his powers to warp reality to his will, making himself a normal human male child, so that he can finally age and experience the vices of the world, including mating.{{Issue|date=November 2009}} Sprite and Makkari are subsequently attacked by Deviants, but Sprite escapes.<ref>''Eternals'' (vol. 3) #6. Marvel Comics.</ref> Sprite was later seen boarding a train to run away from the problems he caused that led to the awakening of the Dreaming Celestial, and was ultimately found by [[Zuras]]. Sprite has no apologies for causing the current situation, and, satisfied with the life he lived, although promising vengeance, allows Zuras to kill him by snapping his neck.<ref>''Eternals'' (vol. 3) #7. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===A new cycle (''Eternals'' vol. 5)===
Following the mass suicidal event that caused all Eternals to die after learning the truth of their origin,<ref>''Avengers'' (vol. 8) #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> they were all reborn simultaneously due to their eternal (both species and longevity-wise) nature. Now resurrected in a female body with none of their memories intact, Sprite is taken in by Ikaris, traveling around New York, subduing Deviants. When they both came back from their trip to New York City, they were suspects in the murder of Zuras. Sprite and Ikaris tracked the murderer's trail to the ruined city of Titanos where they encountered the Mad Titan [[Thanos]].<ref name=":1">''Eternals'' (vol. 5) #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Upon learning of their role in the events ultimately leading to the death of the Eternals and their own subsequent death at Zuras' hands, Sprite is intrigued.<ref name=":5">''Eternals'' (vol. 5) #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Sprite, like all Eternals, has total control over his body's life force and molecular structure, making him virtually [[Immortality|immortal]]; in addition to not aging, Eternals are immune to all known diseases and toxins, radiation, and extremes of temperature. His Eternal body has the appearance of a pre-adolescent child but he is, in fact, hundreds of thousands of years old.

Sprite is able to channel [[cosmic radiation]] into blasts of heat or force, levitate himself and others, and create illusions. He has superhuman strength, though because of his small size and childlike anatomy it is less than that of most Eternals. He is capable of rearranging atoms and molecules in such a way as to radically restructure objects (once creating a working ground-to-orbit [[spacecraft]] in seconds), and is second only to [[Sersi]] in the art of molecular reconstruction.

Sprite, in his former incarnation, successfully used the reality-warping powers of the [[Dreaming Celestial]] to provide himself with a human body that would have aged to adulthood normally, if not for his demise.

===Film===
* Sprite appears in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) film ''[[Eternals (film)|Eternals]]'' (2021), portrayed by [[Lia McHugh]].<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://ew.com/comic-con/2019/07/20/marvel-eternals-comic-con/|title=Marvel introduces 'The Eternals' at Comic-Con with Angelina Jolie, Richard Madden, and more|last=Coggan|first=Devan|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=July 20, 2019|access-date=July 23, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190721135516/https://ew.com/comic-con/2019/07/20/marvel-eternals-comic-con/|archive-date=July 21, 2019}}</ref> She is the grandiose storyteller of the community of genetically-engineered Eternals; synthetic beings made out of cosmic energy by the Celestial Arishem. She appears as an adolescent girl and has been stuck looking like a child for over a millennium. Initially living with [[Sersi (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Sersi]] in England, the return of the [[Deviants (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Deviants]] prompts Sprite to join [[Ikaris (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ikaris]] and Sersi as they reconnect the rest of the Eternals to fight this threat. Sprite desires to return to the Eternals home planet where she will no longer be treated like a child, so when Ikaris' betrayal is revealed she ultimately sides with Ikaris (whom she has long been in love with) against the other Eternals to ensure the birth of the Celestial [[Tiamut]], thus completing their true mission. After attempting to kill Sersi, Sprite is knocked out by [[Druig (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Druig]] and Sersi is able to form a Uni-Mind with the other Eternals and turn Tiamut to stone. Before relinquishing the Uni-Mind, Sprite asks Sersi to use the cosmic power to turn Sprite human, stripping her of her powers and [[immortality]] and allowing her to age into an adult. This also inadvertantly spares her from being summoned into space by a displeased Arishem along with the Eternals who remained on Earth (Sersi, [[Phastos (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Phastos]] and [[Kingo (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Kingo]]), who intends to observe their memories to see if humanity is worthy to live.
** [[Hannah Dodd (actress)|Hannah Dodd]] portrays Sprite in the illusionary adult form of "'''Sandra'''", which she uses to date adults without them thinking her to be a child.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.militarypress.com/the-eternals|title = The ETERNALS|date = January 15, 2022}}</ref>
