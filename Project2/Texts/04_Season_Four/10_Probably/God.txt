 Yea. Look upon me, and know me. Hello, Satan.  It's... been a long time. What brings you here? Do you wish to mount your unholy war against heaven? You want to rule more than hell? You want to destroy the Earth?  Jesus, what the hell happened to you? You got kicked out of here for being a headstrong rebel. And now you're a whiny little bitch. No, you've become dependent on relationships. So you haven't even considered the option of not being with ''either'' of them.  And if you're not sexually attracted to someone, you're not ever going to be. But Saddam isn't right either. He's the other extreme. You need to spend time alone so that you can find the balance, the middle ground. That's what I always do, because I'm a Buddhist. Bingo.  It was nice to see you again, Satan. Goodbye.
