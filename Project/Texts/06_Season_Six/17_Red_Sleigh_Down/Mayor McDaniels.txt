Good evening, everyone. In a moment we'll be lighting the South Park Christmas Tree to kick off the holidays! But now, before we light the tree, I think we should all reflect for a moment on those who are less fortunate than us.  Right now in Iraq there are children who fear us and what we might do to their country. The threat of war touches us all, but over in Iraq, there is no Christmas. They have nothing. Ahalright, here to light the Christmas Tree is a very special young man who shows us all the true meaning of Christmas. Jimmy.  Well, we'd love a Christmas song, wouldn't we, folks? That's it? That's it! The song's over! We can light the tree!  Go on, Jimmy! There's only five more seconds until Christmas!
