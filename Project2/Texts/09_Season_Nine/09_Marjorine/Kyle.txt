What are all you guys doing here? The girls do not have a device that shows them the future Cartman. That's retarded. The outside of the device seems to be covered in numerals. Inside are colors... which must open up to some sort of temporal time warp. That's a pretty solid idea. But who? Now ''look'', Butters, when the girls bring out the future-telling device, pay attention to how it works. Once you know how to operate it, just grab it and get the hell out of there. Jesus, what are they doing in there? Can you see anything?  Wait! I don't wanna know that! I don't wanna know when I'm going to die, fatass!  It's too much power. For anybody. Stan's right. It has to be destroyed.
