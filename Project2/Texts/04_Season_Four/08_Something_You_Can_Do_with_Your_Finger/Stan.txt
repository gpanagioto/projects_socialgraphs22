Boy band? Dude, we don't have any musical talent. He's right. Well, I guess. Well, Cartman wants to start a boy band, so we're gonna rehearse and then try to perform at the South Park Mall.  Well but, Dad, all my friends are doing it.  Cartman says we can make $10 million. Dude, I don't think I could sing any better than that.  Uhhh, next is Ike Broflovski. Aw, come on, dude. Let her try. Come on, nobody's gonna notice. She's the best chance we have! I say she's in. Cartman, it's six in the morning. Do we have to rehearse this early? Costumes?  Hey, Cartman, how come your costume has like, nose rings and facial hair? Hey, Cartman, what does "fingerbang" mean, anyways? Kenny says that's not what it means.  Uh oh, mall cops. Well, I guess we can't get in to see the mall manager. Yeah. Uh-oh. We are making a music video. Dad, I was just a-- Dad, I did all my chores. Why can't I play with my friends? Dad, I ''like'' being in a boy band. I think it's interesting. ''No.'' Dad! It's not fair, Dad! Why can't I be in a boy band? Dad, Cartman said we're gonna perform at the mall at 3 o'clock. My friends are gonna be pissed off at me. I don't understand! Just let me go do this one thing, and I won't ever-- Dad? What the hell is going on? Jesus Christ. ...I never knew.  ...Oh-kay.  Dad? Well... I just wanted to tell you... that I don't think you're a joke. I mean, whatever you used to be, you're just my dad. And you're the best dad I've ever had. Yeah. Not really. Not any more stupid than some of the other stuff you've done. Really? Alright!  Oh my God, they killed Kenny! Oh, yes we do. You were great, Dad. Yeah. I just wanna be a normal kid again. Have a normal life and appreciate what I have. I don't think they sell those anymore.
