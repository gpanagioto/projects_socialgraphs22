This operative of HYDRA may have impressed her superiors enough that, after only a short time in the organization, they promoted her to the level of Madame Hydra VI (the identities of Madames Hydra I through V, who rank above her, are unknown). One of her first missions as Madame Hydra was to capture [[Nick Fury]] and deliver him to the Deltites, a group of artificially created duplicates which were taking over [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] After failing in her mission and discovering that the Deltites were manipulating her, she allied with the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents against the takeover. She was later turned over to federal authorities and was found to be criminally insane, and sent to Arnold Sanitarium for psychiatric treatment (the same sanitarium that Bigfoot was later imprisoned in).<ref>''Nick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #6</ref>

=== Elisa Sinclair ===
{{expand section|date=April 2017}}
Elisa Sinclair has appeared in Captain America's implanted memories that the [[Red Skull]]'s clone and Kobik placed in him to make Captain America think that he is a HYDRA sleeper agent. She is depicted as an ancient being with magical powers that had an extensive reach.<ref>''Captain America: Steve Rogers'' #2</ref>

In the present, Elisa intercepts the [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]] and [[Eric O'Grady]]'s [[Life Model Decoy]] counterpart the Black Ant who were on their way to present evidence of Captain America's brainwashing to [[Maria Hill]].<ref>''Captain America: Steve Rogers'' #12</ref> After keeping the Taskmaster and the Black Ant alive and persuading them to become her personal guards, Elisa then collects a new HYDRA High Council consisting of herself, a new [[Kraken (character)|Kraken]], the [[Gorgon (Tomi Shishido)|Gorgon]], the [[Hive (comics)|Hive]], the [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]], [[Helmut Zemo|Baron Helmut Zemo]], [[Arnim Zola]], and [[Doctor Faustus (comics)|Doctor Faustus]].<ref>''Captain America: Steve Rogers'' #14</ref>

During the "Opening Salvo" part of the ''[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]'' storyline, Elisa reunites with [[Captain America]] after he overthrew the Red Skull for leadership of HYDRA.<ref>''Captain America: Steve Rogers'' #16</ref> While in her study room following HYDRA's takeover of the United States, Elisa uses her magic spells to counter every one of [[Doctor Strange]]'s attempts to bring down the [[Darkforce]] dome that is surrounding [[Manhattan]]. While having tea with Captain America, Elisa is informed of Captain America's suspicion about Baron Zemo and Doctor Faustus' disloyalty. Elisa brushes off the suspicion and tells Captain America that they plan to assemble the Cosmic Cube in order to restore Earth to their vision.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #1</ref> Elisa later gives Captain America the updates on the members of HYDRA's Avengers. She tells him that the [[Scarlet Witch]] has become unhinged due to her being possessed by Chthon, the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] is still kept under HYDRA's control through Arnim Zola's A.I. Virus, and [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Odinson]] is still praying to [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]] about his troubles, like [[Jane Foster]] being trapped in an alternate reality. As Captain America prepares to leave, Elisa tells Captain America that he has become like a son to her.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #5</ref> During HYDRA's attack on the Underground's base at the Mount, Elisa detects an unusual amount of energy in the Mount and rushes in. Madame Hydra arrives and teleports Captain America away at the last second as the Tony Stark A.I. explodes, where it destroys the base and Madame Hydra.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #6</ref>
