==Fictional character biography==
===First encounters===
Little is known of Orphan-Maker's past but apparently, Peter was held captive in [[Mister Sinister]]'s "orphanage" for unknown reasons{{Fact|date=May 2009}}. Mr. Sinister had instead decided that Peter was too uncontrollable and must be killed. Saved by the [[cyborg]] Nanny, he became the first of her "Lost Boys (and Girls)". Under Nanny's direction, Peter, as the Orphan-Maker, began to kill the parents of young mutants (and thus "orphaning" them) and abducting them for Nanny.{{Fact|date=May 2009}}

They would confront the X-Men operating out of a small, faux-town in the Australian outback. [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Dazzler]] and [[Havok (comics)|Havok]] are ambushed and stunned in a ship designed to look like a crash-landed artifact. The captured are physically converted into children. They are given battlesuits themselves and convinced to attack the other X-Men. Some assistance is given by [[Jubilation Lee|Jubilee]], whom the X-Men did not know of at the time. {{Issue|date=May 2009}}

Orphan-Maker and Nanny are temporarily defeated after [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] rescues Havok from his battlesuit. Confused and disoriented from his experience, Havok blasts Nanny's ship, causing much destruction and seemingly causing the death of [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #248. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, Orphan-Maker and Nanny had left behind a dead body that looked like Storm, while de-aging and kidnapping her.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #267. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Later appearances===
The pair would later confront [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]], a super-team made up of the five original X-Men.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

During an incident where a mentally ill young mutant had taken hostages inside his school, Orphan-Maker was driven away partly because the mutant [[Skin (Marvel Comics)|Skin]] managed to interfere with his suit's energy flow. He managed to escape pursuit in a technologically advanced vehicle disguised as an ice cream truck.<ref>''[[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]]'' #4</ref>

Later on, he and Nanny battled with Wolverine after they tried to make an orphan out of Trance (a former X-student). <ref>''Wolverine: Killing Made Simple'' (one-shot) #1.</ref>

===Dawn of X===
In the new status quo for mutants post ''[[House of X and Powers of X]]'', Professor X and Magneto invite all mutants to live on Krakoa and welcome even former enemies into their fold.<ref>''House of X'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> Orphan Maker joins a loose group of outcast mutants, operating under Mister Sinister: the [[Hellions (Marvel Comics)#Dawn of X Hellions|Hellions]], which also comprise Havok, Kwannon, Empath, John Greycrow, Nanny and Wild Child.<ref>''Hellions'' #1-. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Orphan-Maker is a mutant, but has yet to exhibit powers aside from those of his hi-tech battle suit. Also, he remains intellectually a child.

===Battle Suit===
Orphan-Maker's armor is highly resistant to most forms of attack, and has certain reflective properties that allow him to deflect energy attacks such as [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]]' optic blasts. The suit also enhances his strength, and may suppress his mutant powers{{Fact|date=May 2009}}. Orphan-Maker is equipped with large guns that fire destructive energies. When he was outfitted with his new armor, the suit had the capability of forming guns out of its hands.
