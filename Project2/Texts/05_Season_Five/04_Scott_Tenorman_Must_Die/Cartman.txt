 Oh, nothing. No big deal, really. Well, guys, it seems that I am the first one of us to reach manhood after all. Well, because, unlike ''you'' guys, I just got my first pubes! ''Ayada da daa, yadadadadee! [dances]'' Oh yes I did! I'm becoming a man! You wanna see 'em?  Here, check 'em out. There, see? How do you like ''them'' apples!  HA! My pubes. I got 'em from Scott Tenorman. Yup. He let me have 'em for just ten bucks.    You'll get your pubes guys, someday. Uh oo what? Nuh uh!  But then why would Scott Tenorman sell me his pubes for ten dollars? You're telling me these pubes are worth nothing.  Huh I'm gonna get that son-of-a-bitch. Uh, yes, I've come to return these pubes that I purchased, please? Right, but you see, I didn't realize, when I bought these pubes from you, that you were full of shit! So you can either give me back my ten dollars, or I can go tell my mom on you! Just give me back my money... Gimme my ten dollars, Scott!  Tax evasion is a very serious offense, sir! I suggest that you... You will? Oh, cool! Oh. Uh, lessee.  I only got six dollars and twelve cents. ...Okay. Right. Cool. Sweet!  Uh. Oh, goddamnit! That asshole! That big, smelly, ass-sniffin' asshole! I'm gonna get him! What? He is not smarter than me! He just charmed me, that's all! He's a charmer, that Scott Tenorman!! But I'll get him someday!!  One please.  O-kay, and how much is that in pubes? Listen, my money is as good as anybody's! Don't you, uh, discriminate against my people by not accepting these pubes. Racist!  Scott, Scott! Courtney Love is in South Park! She's all drunk and spreading her legs and showing her poonanner to everybody! You gotta go check it out! I'll watch your house for ya!  What?  why do you want then back so much? I don't believe you. Pube fair? Five bucks a hair? The- that's like a million dollars! Hoho, I don't think so, Scott! I'm going to Fort Collins myself! Haha, charade you are, Scott!   Hohoho! I won a million dollars!! Whew! Ow! Hahaaha! Ha. Ha. Heh. Huh, excuse me, sir. Can you tell me where the pube fair is? Yeah, I have some pubes to sell. No- no such thing? I'm Eric Cartman.  Aaah!!! A hundred and six miles, Scott. I had to ride a hundred and six miles in the back of a pickup truck... to get back here Alright, Scott, you win. I give up. Yeah, I'll see you around.  Sure is too bad about my grandma, though...  Huh? Oh, it's... it's not really your concern, since uh-... well, my grandma's in the hospital. She's very sick. The doctors say unless I can come up with sixteen dollars for her operation, they're gonna put her down. Yeah. Poor grandma...  Oh, wow, thanks a lot, Scott!  What? Huh? Why??  Please Scott give me my money. I beg you to give me back my money. What?  I'm a little piggy.  Here's my snout. Oink oink oink. What- What are you doing??  No!... Wh-why? [yells at the sky] Yaaaarrgh! ...You'll diiiiiiiiiie! ...Damn youuuuuuuuuu!  Yes, Clyde!  Sixteen dollars and twelve cents! He is a disease. He is a cold calculating mind, and I will have revenge! Did you guys see that movie "Hannibal"? Where the deformed guy trained giant pigs to eat his enemy alive?? Well, if we find a pony  It will be painful and humiliating! Everyone will see it happen! And then, Scott Tenorman will forever be known as the kid who had his wiener bitten off by a pony!!! WAHAHAHAHAA!!! What? Oh, right. Why should we care?   Christ. Alright, I guess it's just you and me, Timmy! There we go.  Oh no, pony, he'll like that. No, I'm trying to teach it how to bite someone's penis off.  He said it was okay. Because  of Scott Tenorman! I hate him! And I want to make him suffer!  Whattayou mean? How do I do that? I see Scott Tenorman. With his ginger red hair and his stupid freckles and his- Goddmnit goddamnit I hate him!!! Right, right. Let's see... There's posters. Radiohead posters! And he's reading a magazine about Radiohead! You know, that band that sings that song: ''Well, I'm a creep. I'm a weirdo...'' So, the subject is a big Radiohead fan, huh? Maybe I should come up with a  that involves them. Whoa! I'm looking in Scott's parents' room. Scott's mom's about to take off her bra. Radiohead. Yes, of course.   Oh, hey, Scott. How's it goin'? I was just wondering, do you like the band, uh, Radiohead at all? Oh, really? Oh, 'cause, they're doin' a big interview on MTV, and they're playing it tonight on a big screen downtown.  Everyone's gonna be there! You're welcome, Scott.  Okay. Well, it looks like everyone is here. Let's play the video, shall we?   I think all the guys in the band hate him, right guys? Oh, Jesus, did you hear that, Scott?   Yeah. Scott Tenorman is totally not cool! He's ''not cool''! Wow, that really sucks for you, Scott.    That does it! I'm gonna get Scott Tenorman once and for all!!! Hueah. You think you're so cool, Scott Tenorman? We'll see how cool you feel after this-uh! Yes. Yes! Yes!!  Stan, Kyle, thanks for coming. I have it all figured out! How to get Scott Tenorman back! I just finished planning a brilliant  It's the brilliant combination of my last two plans. Scott Tenorman's favorite band is Radiohead, right? So, I realized, 'What if we got Radiohead to come here to South Park?' right? Then they could meet Scott Tenorman — ''and'' — see him get his wiener bitten off by a pony!  Don't you see? If I can get this pony to bite off Scott's wiener in front of Radiohead, then Scott would cry. And if Scott cries, then Radiohead will say Scott Tenorman is totally not cool! And that would make Scott Tenorman wanna die!!  ...Fine, I'll do it myself!! You guys just watch!!   Hello, Scott! I was just stopping by to invite you to my Chili Con Carnival. It's a chili cook-off with rides.  Everyone's coming, and I wanted to drop by your invitation personally!  Yeah! There is even gonna be a big surprise, so you won't wanna miss it, Scott. Oh, and here! Here's a coupon good for one free pony ride! Oh, it will be very neat, Scott.  A little penis-biting, perhaps? Uhnothing, nuhothing! So you'll come for sure then, Scott? Sweeet. Killer. Bye, Scott.   Oh, hello, guys! Thanks for coming to my Chili Con Carnival!  Ohoho, it won't be so dumb when Scott Tenorman arrives. I suggest you stay to see the fireworks! What's so funny? Not yet, but they will be. Hey, Chef. What contest? Huh? Oh. Yeah, I guess it is. Uh, here, Chef, just put it over here.   Likewise. Well, come on, you've got to see the pony! Well, e-yeah, but, there's a special guest coming, and I want you to be near the pony when they arrive.  Goddamnit!  Alright.   Gawh, this is really good, Scott! What? You mean about how you put pubes in your chili?  Yehes, I'm afraid this isn't your chili, Scott. I switched it with Chef's.  I came just in time to see Mr. Denkins giving his report to Officer Barbrady. And of course, to steal the bodies...  I call it, "Mr. & Mrs. Tenorman Chili."   Mm, your tears are so yummy and sweet. Oh, the tears of unfathomable sadness! My-yummy.
