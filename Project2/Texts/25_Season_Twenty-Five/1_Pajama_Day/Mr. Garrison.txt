Okay, children, let's take our seats! Good morning, kids! So great to see you!  Now, look, we're not gettin' married tomorrow or anything. We're just enjoying each other's company and seeing where this whole thing takes us. He's very shy, but I wanted you kids to know that he treats me really well. Way better than that narcissistic psychopath Marcus! Okay, okay, well, you're gonna come pick me up after school? I'll be ready like 3:30.  I ask them for a response, and nothing! First they just sit there when I need their focus and their energy, and when I ask themâ€“ I don't know how much more I can take of this. I've got enough problems as it is. Good morning, class!  Could somebody wake Butters up, please? I'm sorry Butters, am I boring you? Okay, well, then maybe you can tell me what Rick said when I told him about Marcus?! Anybody? Does anyone know what I said when Rick held me tight?! "This is security!" None of you are paying attention! None of you know the answers, do you?!
