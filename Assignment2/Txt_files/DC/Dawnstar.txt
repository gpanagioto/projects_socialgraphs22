'''Dawnstar''' is a [[fictional]] [[superhero]]ine in [[comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. She was created by [[Paul Levitz]] and [[Mike Grell]]. She is a member of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] in the 30th and 31st centuries of the [[DC Universe]]. Dawnstar is a character of [[Ancestral Puebloans#Anasazi as a cultural label|Anasazi Indian]] heritage.

== Fictional character biography ==
[[File:Dawnstar-LaRocque-Stars.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Pre-Crisis version of the character. Interior artwork from ''Legion of Super-Heroes'' (vol. 3) #17; art by [[Greg LaRocque]].]]
Dawnstar (her real name, she has no Legion code name) is from the planet Starhaven, a world colonized by [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] abducted from Earth by an unknown alien race in the 13th Century. Her name is derived from the appearance on Earth of the planet [[Venus]], the "morning star", and which is the reason she wears an eight-pointed star ornament on her forehead.

Dawnstar's people are of [[Ancestral Puebloans#Anasazi as a cultural label|Anasazi Indian]] heritage. Starhavenites have pairs of large white-feathered wings that grow out of their upper backs, the result of genetic engineering by the unknown alien race that resettled them and triggered their [[metagene]]s.<ref>As shown in a recent [[retcon]] in ''[[R.E.B.E.L.S.]]'' (vol. 2) #3 (June 2009); no earlier reference had been made to any specific tribe.</ref> Their appearance is somewhat similar to Thanagarians.

Dawnstar's parents are Mistrider and Moonwalker, and her younger brothers are Greybird and Greatfire.<ref>''[[Who's Who in the DC Universe#Who's Who in the Legion of Super-Heroes|Who's Who in the Legion of Super-Heroes]]'' #1 (April 1988)</ref> During her late childhood and early teens, her parents built a thriving business on their daughter's ability to guide spaceships through hazardous areas of space.<ref name="Super-Heroes' 1978">''Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes'' #240 (June 1978)</ref> She also worked as a guide to hunters of animals.<ref>''Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes'' #226 (April 1977)</ref>

Dawnstar received an invitation from Legion financier [[R. J. Brande|R.J. Brande]] to attend [[the Legion Academy]],<ref name="Super-Heroes' 1978" /> and reluctantly accepted the opportunity. She was first introduced to the Legionnaires at age 16 as a recent graduate of the Academy.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=McAvennie |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |title=DC Comics Year By Year: A Visual Chronicle |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-8578-6 |page=164}}</ref> Her tracking and navigation talents earned her full membership on her first mission. Her Legion stipend went to pay for enhancing her home world's defenses.

She served in many missions with the Legionnaires, contributing her often underrated talents at tracking and high-speed travel to perform many rescues of her colleagues, as well as investigations of personal disappearances and similar mysteries. She also brought these talents into many Legion adventures in other times, especially the 20th Century. Notable here is her early role in the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' (1985).

Dawnstar had a lengthy, tragic romance with fellow Legionnaire [[Wildfire (comics)|Wildfire]]. They each respected the other's defiant, outspoken personality, although they counseled each other on working with their talents as part of a team instead of acting as individuals. Wildfire had been turned into an anti-energy being in a containment suit, and thus had no physical body, so the two were unable to have physical relationship.<ref>''Legion of Super-Heroes'' (vol. 3) #58 (March 1989)</ref> Later in ''Justice League of America'' #9 (2007), Dawnstar was shown in a relationship with a woman indicating she is at least bi-sexual.

After the Legion's timeline was "reset" by the Legion's battle with Mordru,<ref>''Legion of Super-Heroes'' (vol. 4) #5</ref> Dawnstar was shown as having been possessed by an evil entity called '''Bounty''' in the new timeline, who amputated her wings and forced her to use her tracking powers as an assassin. Dawnstar was later freed from the entity's control.<ref>''Legion of Super-Heroes'' (vol. 4) #36</ref> She was spiritually healed, but her destiny was never resolved, as she vanished<ref>''Legionnaires'' #17 (August 1994)</ref> shortly before the Legion's timeline was erased by the events depicted in ''[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]'' (1994) and by the ensuing [[Reboot (continuity)|reboot]].

== Current status ==
''Legion of Super-Heroes'' (vol. 5) #15 (February 2006) featured a Barry Kitson cover which depicted Dawnstar alongside classic Legion members [[Blok (comics)|Blok]] and [[Tyroc]]. The solicitation for this issue hinted that the Legion would become the "greatest heroes of the Multiverse". Dawnstar appeared only briefly with other Legionnaires from previous iterations of the team, as a character in a "campfire story" showing the Legion's influence and the legends and myths that had sprung up around it. This cameo appearance does not appear to have been meant to take place in the series' continuity, nor was it included in the [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] (although it was included in a later collection).

In a ''[[Justice Society of America|JSA]]-[[Justice League of America|JLA]]'' crossover story, "[[The Lightning Saga]]", Dawnstar (along with many other [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Pre-Crisis]] Legionnaires) was seen as a statue in [[Superman]]'s [[Fortress of Solitude]]. Several members of the JSA and JLA tracked Dawnstar's flight ring to Thanagar, but she had left it there with a woman as a promise to return.

Dawnstar, with her wings and original appearance, then united with other Legionnaires in the 21st century in an effort to save someone's life (they hold rods that resemble those used for a similar action, to save [[Lightning Lad]], in the original [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] Legion stories).<ref>This ultimately was shown to be Kid Flash, in ''[[Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds]]'' #3.</ref> Although it was predicted that at least one was risking his or her own life, no one died, and the Legion contingent returned to the 31st century.

The Legion shown in this story also took part in the "[[Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes]]" story, set in its own time and involving Superman, in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #858–863 (2007–2008). In this series, Dawnstar's uniform was extensively redesigned.

Dawnstar is shown with this Pre-Crisis Legion in the [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''[[Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds]]'' (2008). In this series, she finally admits her true feelings to Wildfire (after he nearly died trying to defend her from Superboy-Prime) and begins a positive relationship with him.

Following DC's ''[[New 52]]'' reboot, Dawnstar was one of a number of characters shown to be stranded in the 21st century in the 2012–2013 ''[[Legion Lost]]'' series. Following that series' cancellation with issue 16, those characters remained stuck in their past. In the ''Future's End: 5 Years Later'' event she is shown to have joined the [[Justice League]].

==Powers and abilities==
Dawnstar's unique powers include the ability to [[Tracking (hunting)|track]] life forms and objects across light years of distance and through [[Interstellar medium|interstellar space]]. She can survive in deep space for long periods of time without a [[spacesuit]] or viable [[atmosphere]], by generating a self-sustaining environmental forcefield. In deep space, she can travel at faster-than-light speeds. In an Earth-normal atmosphere or in a sizable gravity, her speed is limited by friction & drag.

==Equipment==
As a member of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]], she is provided a Legion Flight Ring. While not needing it most of the time, she can use the signal for help, for monitoring of her location, and for other non-flight uses.<ref>''[[Who's Who in the DC Universe]]'' #6 (August 1985), ''Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes'' #240 (June 1978), ''Who's Who in the Legion of Super-Heroes'' #1 (April 1988)</ref>

==Other versions==
* Dawnstar did not appear in the post-Zero-Hour ("[[Legion of Super-Heroes#Rebooted .281994.E2.80.932004.29|reboot]]") Legion stories, except for a crossover of multiple timelines and Legions made by the Time Trapper. Several versions of her, including a demon with leather wings and ram horns, were shown at once.<ref>''Legion of Super-Heroes'' (vol. 4) #105</ref>
* Beginning in the reboot's limited series "Legion Lost", a character was depicted called [[Shikari (DC Comics)|Shikari]] from a non-human species, the Kwai. Shikari had insectoid wings, an armored exoskeleton she could activate for space travel, and pathfinding (rather than tracking) powers of similar scope. There was some speculation that this was a revised version of Dawnstar.
* Dawnstar did not appear in the recently concluded "[[Legion of Super-Heroes#.22Threeboot.22 continuity .282004.E2.80.932009.29|threeboot]]" Legion stories, but she has become a regular character in the new [[Legion Lost]], which has her and several of her Legion companions from the (yet again) rebooted continuity stranded in the twenty-first century.
* An ancestor of Dawnstar, known as [[Wildstar (DC Comics)|Wildstar]] is a member of the 21st century hero team [[R.E.B.E.L.S.]] She has the combined powers of Dawnstar and [[Wildfire (comics)|Wildfire]].
* Dawnstar appears in ''[[DC Bombshells]]''.
* Dawnstar is featured in the ''[[Smallville|Smallville Season 11]]'' digital comic based on the [[Smallville|TV series]].<ref>''Smallville Season 11: Continuity'' #2 (March 2015)</ref>

==In other media==
* Dawnstar appears in the second and final (2007–2008) season of the ''[[Legion of Super Heroes (TV series)|Legion of Super Heroes]]''. In the concluding two-part episode "Dark Victory", she is visible on three occasions standing or flying in the midst of a large group of Legionnaires.
* Dawnstar appears as a main character in the animated film ''[[JLA Adventures: Trapped in Time]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.supermanhomepage.com/news.php?readmore=14467|title=Superman Homepage|website=www.supermanhomepage.com|access-date=25 April 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140120163617/http://www.supermanhomepage.com/news.php?readmore=14467|archive-date=20 January 2014}}</ref> voiced by [[Laura Bailey (voice actress)|Laura Bailey]]. In the film she and Karate Kid are still rejected as members of the Legion, she also had photokinetic abilities. According to herself, she has never told a lie, making using the [[lasso of truth]] pointless.
* Dawnstar makes a cameo appearance in the final scene of ''[[Justice League vs. the Fatal Five]]'' as one of the Legionnaires traveling to the 21st century to honor their fallen member [[Thom Kallor|Starboy]].

===Miscellaneous===
* She also appears, but with dialogue and extensive action, in issue #19 of ''[[Legion of Super Heroes (TV series)|Legion of Super Heroes]]'' comic based on the titular animated TV show.
