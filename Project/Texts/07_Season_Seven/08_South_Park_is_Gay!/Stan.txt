Oh my God, you guys are not gonna believe what happened to me last night. So, I'm watching the season premiere of ''Boy Meets Boy'' on television, and then ''Queer Eye for the Straight Guy'' comes on, right? So I fall asleep in front of the TV, and when I wake up, I see that I've spilled the Coke I was drinking all over my satin pajama top. I know! Oh, tell me about it, Ken doll. You've gotta get with the times, girlfriend. Oohh my God, you got splotches on your neck. Are you using any exfoliating products at all?? Come on, Kyle! We're giving you a makeover!  Dude, I can't wait for Wendy to see how gay I look! All right. Let's work it!  What the...? Hey Craig. These guys are trying to say they're gayer than us! Oh My God, this is not a fad, this is who we are! We're metrosexual!! Dude! W-what are you doing? We're not straight! You're straight! Wow, is that from Origins? Well, what can we do about it? What?? That's stupid. We wouldn't have to kill Kyle! We would just to tell him not to hang around us anymore. Yeah. Wait, what?  Hey, what's goin' on? Wow, we look great! You'd better shut up, Craig. It is not! Dad, Craig is trying to say that his dad can out dress you! Kyle. Hey, ese. You wanna come play catch with us? Yeah. It's cool, holmes. Aw Jesus, Kyle, don't be such a whiny little gaywad! Come play catch with us.
