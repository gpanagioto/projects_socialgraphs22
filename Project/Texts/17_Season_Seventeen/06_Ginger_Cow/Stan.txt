How come you're carrying Cartman's stuff?  What the fuck? Hey Kyle. Kyle, there's peace in the Middle East. They're saying maybe it's gonna lead to peace all over the world. Everyone's really happy. You should be too. ...Dude, we've been friends a long time. Can you just tell me why you like Cartman's farts so much? You like... how they smell? How they taste? They're really that good? Should I try them? ...Kyle, maybe you should get some help. I don't get it, Kenny. Well whatever it is, we have to figure it out. I think all those farts are starting to get to Kyle's head. Kyle, don't do this. Don't eat Cartman's farts in front of the whole world. Hey Kyle. Um, dude, we need to talk. This has to stop. If you wanna suck farts, Kyle, that's fine. Go ahead. But you can't suck farts and be a dick about it. All of a sudden you seem to think you're above everyone else! See? You sound like a dick. Dick! That's a dick talking! You've had too much of Cartman's farts and you got sulphur poisoning, and now you're a dick. I don't think Kyle really loves Cartman's farts. There's something else going on. This all started with the stupid peace in the Middle East, Kenny. For some reason it's making Kyle crazy. We've gotta get to the bottom of this! Yes, there's something that you all need to know. The truth about the red cow. We have all been  Hello? No, dude, you don't understand. Cartman hasn't been telling the truth! Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Well, I'm not okay with it, 'cause it's turned you into a dick, Kyle! You know, I don't think when Gandhi starved himself he was all "Dude, look how fuckin' awesome I am for starving. Check me out!" You should apologize to Kenny too. The red cow... I saw it too. Ih it came down from the sky in a flash of light. It ''was'' a miracle.
