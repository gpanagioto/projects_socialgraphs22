'Recap:Priest Maxi is shown at the church podium before the congregation

Announcer

Previously on South Park...

Priest Maxi

Today, we are going to talk about hell. [an organ swells into a dreadful chord. The boys are afraid]

+++++


Hell, River Styx Condominiums. Saddam appears at Satan's door

Saddam

Hello, Satan! [opens his arms wide and grins big. He has two suitcases, one on either side of him]

Satan

[stunned] Saddam...

+++++


Broflovski residence. Sheila and Kyle are talking

Sheila

Us Jews don't believe in hell.

Kyle

But what if we're wrong?

+++++


South Park Avenue, day. The kids begin crossing the street

Stan

Let's go. [the kids begin to cross the street, Kenny first, but a tour bus slams into Kenny and takes him away. The other kids freeze where they are, petrified]

Stan

[finally reacts, shrilly] ...they've killed Kenny!

Butters

He had sins that he didn't confess!

+++++


Hell, River Styx Condominiums, dinner. Saddam tries to arouse Satan under the table. Satan swats Saddam's arm away

Satan

No, Saddam, I told you. I'm with Chris now.

+++++


Church rectory. Priest Maxi is talking to the boys

Priest Maxi

Boys, it is your Christian duty to save the souls of your friends!

+++++


Hell, River Styx Condominiums, bedtime. Satan and Chris are in bed

Chris

[closes his eyes] I love you, Satan.

Satan

I love you too, Saddam.

Satan/Chris

[immediately react] Wuh?!

+++++


Pacific Ocean. A man drives a speedboat. Richie Cunningham, Ralph Malph, and Potsy Weber go along for the ride, and Arthur Fonzarelli stands behind the boat on water skis. Wait...

Richie

Fonz, there's no way you can jump that shark with your water skis. [A buoy ring contains a shark, and a larger red buoy warns "DANGER" in white letters]

Fonzie

Aaaay! I've gotta try, Richie.

+++++


Church confessional, day. Cartman opens the penitent door and sees a woman with her exposed ass up against the partition

Woman

Oh, huhuh. [Cartman opens the priest's door. Priest Maxi, in a sexual act with the woman on the other side, looks out and grins]

Stan

Dude, if this guy's goin' to hell, who's gonna save us?

Cartman

Well, it looks like we're gonna have to save everyone in this town ourselves!

+++++


Beach. Richie, Potsy, Ralph, and Joanie are on the shore watching the boat driver take Fonzie on his stunt. On shore is a sign posted on a pair of surfboards that reads "GO FONZ!!!"

Joanie

Go Fonz!!!

Fonzie

Aaaaaa-- [the image freezes in place, so that Fonzie is suspended in mid-air]

Announcer

And now the exciting conclusion of... South Park.

Fonzie

[action resumes]—aaaaaayy-err. [lands inside the buoy ring; the shark catches and eats him live. The shark rises out of the water with Fonzie still in its mouth] No! [the shark drops and rises again] No! [...and again...] No! [a pool of blood develops inside the buoy ring] No!

Richie

I told him he couldn't do it. [the other three on shore look on stunned]

+++++


South Park Elementary, playground. Cartman stands on a platform and is preaching to the kids

Cartman

I am saying this because we must be saved-uh. The Lord is powerful and he will smote the sinners and send them to everlasting hell-uh. If you do not live your life for Him-uh, then to the lake of fire you shall go-uh! [a group of adults gathers just outside the rear school doors. Kyle joins Cartman on the platform...]

Principal Victoria

["'Well, God is gonna heal those eyes, and save you from the devil begone! Oh, praise His name!"] You see that, parents? Your children have refused to come into class since this morning. I'm afraid your son is the leader, Ms. Cartman. ["But do you believe in the power of God?"] Apparently he's read the entire Bible, and now he's scaring the hell out of everyone.

Liane

[gently calls out] Boopie-kins. ["Do you believe he is gonna cure your face of the uglies?"] It's time to stop preaching damnation to everyone, sweetie. [Cartman stops]

Stan

[joins Cartman on the platform] Don't you guys, um... persecrute our religious beliefs.

Kids

Yeah!

Sharon

We are not trying to persecute you kids, but you're supposed to be in school.

Stan

What purpose does school have? The Bible says the only goal in this life is to praise God and get into heaven.

Kyle

Yeah, this life is short. The afterlife is forever.

Principal Victoria

Don't listen to them, kids. You have to go to school.

Cartman

Many of you knew Kenny McCormick. He was a playful school-going eight-year-old. And then yesterday, he was [throws himself down face-first] smacked down by the Lord-uh! [rises] God bitch-slapped him right to the fiery depths of hell! So when will you go? Tomorrow? Ten years? Does it mattah?! No! Because unless you give this life to the Lord, that life belongs to Satan-uh! [kids gasp, adults go glum] But we cannot worship God in that church where that priest of sin resides, [Kyle has left and now returns with an easel with a picture of a church on it] so we will build a new church-uh. With crystal walls, a ceiling 80 feet high, and a slide that connects this part hmya [near the top of the left-side wall] to this part hmya. [the grass down below] Who will help us?

Kids

[in unison] I will.

Cartman

Praise God-uh!

+++++


Hell, River Styx Condominiums. Satan is seen looking at the Bargain Hotel Saddam is in

Satan

If I go spend the night with Saddam, then it's over between me and Chris. [looks at Saddam's room key] Chris has been so nice to me and I know Saddam will just hurt me again. [looks at it again] M-maybe I'll just go talk to Saddam. I need closure, yeah. That's it, I need closure. [advances to the hotel, to room 16, then turns around with second thoughts] What am I doing? [takes a step when the room door opens]

Saddam

[in evening suit] What took yo so long, baby?

Satan

[turns around] Saddam, I'm just here to talk.

Saddam

Great! Let's talk! [Saddam enters. Saddam rushes to the bed and sits on it, stroking the covers] Hmm, this bed is comfy-bumpy.

Satan

Saddam, I only came here because I need closure.

Saddam

Sounds fun. You know me, I'll try anything.

Satan

No! Saddam, listen to me.

Saddam

Would you like a drink?

Satan

Um, maybe just... a little one. [Saddam serves him a drink] I have to go back soon. I need you to understand that we can't be together anymore. [Satan turns on the TV and a video of a group of men is shown. A sheriff lowers his pants before a kneeling skinhead. Other men are singing, chanting, moaning] I need you to not come by the condo and not try to see me. Chris thinks we can all be friends, but I don't. And I have to focus on Chris now. [just now notices the video] What is this?

Saddam

These hotels have all kinds of crazy channels.

Satan

Saddam, will you listen to me?! Chris is a great person. He's the one I wanna be with now.

Saddam

[knowingly] Really? So then... What are you doing here? [Satan has no answer. He just looks down and away] Well, I don't know about you, but this video is gettin' me pretty hot!

Satan

[hurt] Saddam...

Saddam

Here, have another drink. [Satan takes it and swallows it down]

+++++


Hell, Bargain Hotel, Saddam's room. Satan is sleeping away peacefully

Satan

[wakes up] Ooh, whoa... God, my head. Drank too much. [looks to his left] Chris? [the camera zooms out to show Saddam, dressed in leather straps, looking at him lovingly. Five different kinds of dildos and a whip are seen. Satan quickly sits up] Oh no!! [scans the room and sees more sex toys, including an auto club, an Antonio Banderas blow-up doll, a penis pump, and a goat tied to a lamp]

Saddam

[snuggling up] Man, look at that! We went through 14 bottles of vegetable oil! [tosses the last one off the bed.] Ewuh, I'm all greasy.

Satan

[leaves the bed] Oh God, what time is it?

Saddam

Last night was awesome! Are we together again now?

Satan

I don't know. I-I guess so, but now I have to go home and tell Chris.

Saddam

Screw him!!

Satan

No, Saddam! I at least owe him an explanation! [walks towards the door] I just don't know what I'm gonna say. [the door opens and closes. Satan is gone]

Saddam

I know how to solve this little problem.

+++++


Baja California coast, Mexico, day. The camera pans slowly to the right.

Driver

[off-screen] We are now entering Ensenada, the second largest city on the Mexican Baja Peninsula. [the tour bus is seen making its way through Ensenada] We have now traveled over 2000 miles since leaving New York City. We'll just be stopping here for a few moments for gas, and then our tour will continue onto its final destination. [two gas station attendants approach the bus. One of them notices something]

Attendant

Oiga. Hay algo pegado bajo el autobus. ["Listen. There's something stuck under the bus."]

Driver

'Kay. What's stuck to the bottom of the bus? [the attendant takes his mop and jabs at the bottom of the bus, and Kenny finally drops down]

Kenny

(Ahow..!)

Driver

Oh, goodness! We must have run over a little Mexican further up north. Is it okay? [Kenny sits up and shakes his dizziness off]

Attendant

Pienso que sí. ["I think so." Kenny stands up]

Driver

Well, here's fifty for the gas. [starts the bus and drives off] Adios.

Kenny

(Where am I?)

Attendant

¿Qué?

Kenny

(Where am I?)

Attendant

¿Qué?

+++++


South Park, day. Cartman's blueprint for his church is shown, then the camera pans right to show the actual construction. A bunch of kids work on the structure, using all sorts of things, including mirrors for wall panels.

Cartman

This is bea-utiful. Thine church is almost completed.

Stan

There's no way God will want to send us to hell now.

Kyle

Yeah, this church kicks a-- Eh... I-it kicks!

Gerald

[shows up with Sheila, behind the boys] Hello, boys. [they turn around]

Kyle

Don't try to take me away again, Mom and Dad! I told you! I renounced the Jewish faith!

Sheila

It's not that, Kyle. It's just that Eric's mother needs to see you all right away. [Stan, Cartman and Kyle look at each other, suspicious] Just really quick; she says it's very important.

Cartman

Very well. Yea. Guys, let us walk to mine home and see what mine mom wants. [the boys turn left and walk towards Cartman's house]

Sheila

I sure hope this works.

+++++


Cartman residence, later. Cartman, Stan, and Kyle enter. Dialog from "Not Without My Anus," set to an organ and canned laughter, is heard as the boys make their way across a living room littered with toys of all sorts. The room is decorated so that the boys would forget their "mission" and just play for one afternoon. Liane shows up with a Cartman favorite.

Liane

Hello, kiddies. I made you all powdered doughnut pancake surprise.

Stan

Wow, cool.

Cartman

No! This is a trick! Do not vex me, O temptress!

Liane

What?

Cartman

This is a distraction from our work on the church! [grabs a doughnut] Do not think that you can tempt us with toys [takes a bite out of his doughnut] and new games [munches away] and tidings of powdered doughnut pancake surprise! For it is the afterlife we have concerned ourselves with! [finishes the doughnut off] Not the pleasures of this Earth, but salvation in the world aftah!!

Stan

Yeah!

Liane

Oh. Well, [sets the dish on the sofa and walks away] alrighty then.

+++++


Kitchen, moments later. Liane enters. Sister Anne waits with Stan's and Kyle's parents

Liane

I... don't think it worked.

All

Aww.

+++++


Living room, moments later.

Cartman

Let us get back to our work at the church. [the phone rings] Yea. I shall answer the phone, hyah. [answers it] Hello?

Kenny

[from a pay phone next to Papas & Beer in Ensenada] (Cartman?! Cartman, you've gotta help me, and I'm not foolin' around!)

Cartman

[grins mischievously, then] Oh my God!!

Stan

What?

Cartman

It's Kenny. He's calling from beyond the grave!

Stan

Kenny?! [move towards the phone] What's he say?

Kyle

[moves next to Stan] Ask him what hell is like.

Cartman

Kenny! You have to tell us about hell! Give us every last horrible detail!

Kenny

(Um...) [mariachi music is heard, and the street is lively enough]

+++++


Hell, River Styx Condominiums. Satan has returned, and is outside the door to his condo

Satan

Oh, God, Chris is gonna be so mad at me. Well, here it goes. [opens the door and enters. Chris is sitting alone on the sofa reading a book]

Chris

Hey, you.

Satan

Hi, Chris. [closes the door]

Chris

You... were out all night.

Satan

Yeah, I just... spent the night walking around the marina.

Chris

Satan. You know you're not a very good liar. You went and saw Saddam, didn't you?

Satan

[low voice] Yes. [covers his face in shame]

Chris

[approaches] Satan, I understand.

Satan

[drops his left arm and looks surprised] What?

Chris

I still feel secure and safe with you.

Satan

[walks away exasperated] Oh, n-no!

Chris

[puzzled] What? What's wrong? I said it's okay.

Satan

I know.

Chris

Well, what more do you want from me?

Satan

[turns around] Well... could you not be such a pussy about it? I mean, can't you just say "If you ever see Saddam again, I'll break your legs!" or, or "I'm gonna go kick Saddam's ass!" or something?

Chris

Satan, I'm a '90s man. I cry when I need to. I share my feelings and I keep my mind open about everything.

Satan

Just... give me some boundaries, be jealous, go throw a football around, for Christ's sake.

Chris

[sits down on the sofa] Now you're starting to hurt my feelings.

Satan

[turns away] Ah—I'm sorry, Chris, it's... it's not you, really, it's, it's me. [Saddam pops up outside the window and checks out the situation, then drops down] You're the best thing that's ever happened to me, and for some reason, I just can't accept that. [Saddam slides the window open and drops in behind the sofa, making his way to Chris]

Saddam

[pops up behind Chris with a dagger] Die, pussy! [rams it into Chris's forehead]

Chris

Agghhh!

Satan

[turns around] Chris! [advances] Saddam, what the hell are you doing?!

Saddam

[a dead Chris lies slumped against the sofa's arm] There. I got rid of the problem for you. Now there's no conflict.

Satan

[distraught, buries his face in his hands] No! Not like this..!

+++++


South Park, day. Cartman's church is finished. Red carpet, purple doors... His new followers are gathered inside

Cartman

[on stage wielding a Bible] Friends, I have to tell you that last night I received a phone call from beyond the grave-eh. [the kids gasp] It was our departed friend, Kenny! Calling from the depths of hell! And he described what hell is like in horrid detail-uh. [the kids are frightened] He said that in hell, the smell is awful. He said that in hell, everyone speaks Spanish.

Kids

Wagghh..!

Cartman

He said there is water in hell, but if you drink it you pee blood out your ass for seven hours-uh!

Kids

Whoa!

Cartman

And perhaps worst of all, in hell, there are dozens and dozens of little trinket stores! But they all have the same little trinkets in them-eh!

Kids

Wagghh! [a couple enters the church]

Father

Where is our daughter?

Heidi

[steps into the aisle] Dad?

Father

Marcy! You're coming home this instant!

Cartman

[quite animated, hops twice] We are saving your daughter from the clutches of hell, suh! [points]

Father

You're not gonna make my daughter part of your cult!

Cartman

Your daughter could die tomorrow, and then what?!

Father

[a piece of wood falls from the roof] You're just a stupid little fat kid who thinks that-- [jab] Aagghh--! [the piece of wood falls off the man's head and rests behind him]

Mother

Stephen? [the kids are shocked; she genuflects next to him] Stephen, no!

Cartman

The Lord has spoken again-uh! O, forgive us, Lord, for our sins-uh!

Kids

Forgive us, Lord.

Cartman

Let us pray. [an organ is played] Heavenly Father, do not send us to hell. We're sorry. Whatever we did, we're sorry.

Mother

[in a panic] Stephen? Stephen?

+++++


Hell, waiting area. Many souls are there, wondering where they are, and why

Stephen

Where... where am I?

Man

Where are we?

Man 2

No doubt about it...

Woman

What's happening??

Man 3

Oooooooooh!

Speaker

Hello, newcomers, and welcome. Can everybody hear me? [taps the mic a few times] Hello? Can everyb--? Okay. [the crowd quiets down] Uh, I'm the hell director. Uh, it looks like we have about 8,615 of you newbies today, and for those of you who are a little confused, uh, you are dead, and this is hell, so, abandon all hope and uh yada yada yada. Uh, we are now going to start the orientation process, which will last about--

Man 4

Hey, wait a minute, I shouldn't be here. I was a totally strict and devout Protestant! I thought we went to heaven!

Hell director

Yes, well I'm afraid you were wrong.

Soldier

I was a practicing Jehovah's Witness.

Hell director

Uh, you picked the wrong religion as well.

Man 5

Well, who was right? Who gets into heaven?

Hell director

I'm afraid it was the Mormons. Yes, the Mormons were the correct answer.

Crowd

[disappointed] Awww.

Hell director

So now I'd like to quickly introduce your new ruler and master for eternity, Satan.

Satan

[appears in a burst of flame] Oooyeah!

Crowd

Aaggghh!

Satan

Now you are all part of my domain! Everyday in hell grows larger as my minions... my m-minions uh... [relents] muh, I'm sorry. I just can't do this today. I'm just... I'm sorry. [walks away. The crowd's eyes follow him. A woman throws her hands up]

Hell director

Uh, okay. Thank you, Satan. Now, uh, let's begin with the Muslims...

Chris

[in the crowd] Satan! [Satan turns and sees him, then smiles. Chris makes his way through the crowd] 'Scuse me. Excuse me.

Satan

Chris! [he and Chris now stand before each other] But I thought you were dead!

Chris

Yeah, well, where was I gonna go? Detroit?

Satan

Chris, I didn't mean for Saddam to stab you in--

Chris

Hey, it's alright. All that matters is that I'm back, and we're together forever. Right?

Satan

Uh... yeah. Gr-great.

Crowd

Awww.

+++++


Cartman residence, night. Cartman is working at a coffee table in the living room with Clyde Frog and a Bible

Cartman

Let's see... Matthew 15:11. "Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which comes out of the mouth defileth a man." That's a good one, Clyde Frog. Interesting. [Sister Anne approaches]

Liane

[enters] Eric, Sister Anne has come to visit you.

Cartman

Yea. It is nice to see you, Sister, but I must prepare for my next sermon. [Liane leaves]

Sister Anne

[sits] Eric, you need to stop what you're doing. You need to tell all the kids to go back to school, and back to their normal lives.

Cartman

Sister, have you read this book?

Sister Anne

Yes, Eric. A lot more than you have.

Cartman

Then you know what it says happens to those who don't follow the Lord-uh.

Sister Anne

Eric, the Lord just doesn't send everybody to hell. That wouldn't make sense. He wants people to live their lives.

Cartman

Are you saying that what the Bible says isn't true?

Sister Anne

No.

Cartman

We've got Jews and perverts and bullies and all kinds of sinners in this town, Sister Anne-uh! And without the priest we've decided to save ourselves. The only ones that kids can trust now are me and Jesus! [resumes his work]

Sister Anne

[exasperated, drops her head in her hands] Uugh..! [lifts her head] Wait a minute. That's it. [rises and walks away]

Televangelist

[suddenly on TV] ...And I'm gonna save all of you right now. [raps a woman on the head. She goes unconscious] I'm gonna heal your sins-eh.

Cartman

Well...

+++++


Hell, Bargain Hotel. Chris approaches and goes to Room 16, and knocks on the door

Saddam

Hello Satan-ooh, crap! It's you!

Chris

Yeah. It's me.

Saddam

I thought I killed you!

Chris

Yeah...

Saddam/Chris

Well, where was I gonna go? Detroit?

Saddam

Right, right.

Chris

Do you have a couple of minutes to go for a walk?

Saddam

A walk?

Chris

Yeah. Just real quick. Around the park or somethin'.

Saddam

[considers it] Is this some kind of trick?

Chris

No, I just want you to go for a quick walk with me. Please?

Saddam

Well, alright. Just let me grab somethin' real quick. [goes inside humming and reaches his dresser. He sees the dagger and takes it with him behind his back, then rejoins Chris] Okay, let's walk. [Chris walks while Saddam closes the door]

+++++


Hell, the park. Saddam and Chris walk side by side

Chris

Saddam, I get the feeling that you don't like me very much.

Saddam

Gee, whatever gave you that idea? When I stabbed you in the head?

Chris

Look, Satan is a very important person to me. And I know he's an important person to you, too. So don't you think it's best for us to just... try and get along? I realize that some things about me bother you. So I'd like to hear what those things are so that I can work on them.

Saddam

You know why I don't like you, Chris? Because you're the kind of guy who, if someone didn't like him, would take him for a walk in the park and ask him why. You're a pussy! [takes his dagger out and slices into Chris's right shoulder]

Chris

Agghhh! [Saddam goes into a grave, takes out a shovel, and slices off Chris's lower right leg. Chris falls down] Oh God!

Saddam

Ah hahaha!

Chris

Nooo! Agh! [reaches into his right shoulder, takes the dagger, and thrusts it into Saddam's left eye]

Saddam

Aggghhh! [swings the shovel at Chris and strikes him down with it]

Chris

Ow! [Saddam jumps on him and pulls his heart out of his body] Goo-aagh..! [Saddam holds the heart high in the air, then collapses on top of Chris's body. The camera zooms out]

+++++


Cartman's church, next day. The child congregation is gathered again at the church. Organ music plays

Cartman

Today this Jewish boy and all sinners are going to be saved-uh! Kyle, do you believe in God-uh?

Kyle

Yes!

Cartman

Do you want to be saved from hell-uh?!

Kyle

Yes!

Cartman

That's good, because right now, all the Jewness is comin' out of your body, bein' replaced by the Spirit of God-uh! [smacks him on the face] Theah!

Kyle

[angrily] Ow! [rubs his right temple and cheek while Cartman talks]

Cartman

Praise God! How do you feel now? Do you feel the light of God inside o'ya?

Kyle

[softens] Uh, I think so.

Cartman

Praise the Lord-uh!

Crowd

[ad lib all at once] Praise the Lord. Hallelujah! Praise God! [two robed assistants help a happy Kyle off the stage]

Cartman

For he is Lord, he is Lord... Bring up the next person! [Timmy rolls up in his wheelchair] This boy has been crippled with sin-uh. But I hear God saying that this boy will walk!

Butters

Huh-Hallelujah!

Timmy

Timmiiiy!

Cartman

We are gonna save you and you are gonna walk with the Lord-uh!

Timmy

Timmiiiy!

Cartman

Devil be [smacks him on the face] gone-uh!

Timmy

Haagggh.

Cartman

Now walk, Timmih! [turns away dramatically, with eyes closed]

Timmy

Haagggh.

Cartman

[turns away, then back] Come on, Timmy, get out of that chair-uh!

Timmy

Haghh.

Cartman

The Lord wants you to walk, Timmih! Oo-walk, Timmih! [turns away dramatically, with eyes closed]

Timmy

Timmilih? [drops to the floor on his feet and stands unsteadily. Cartman smiles openly]

Cartman

He walks-uh!

Kids

Whoa!

Timmy

Oh-aagghhh! [falls forward and crashes through the floor head first. A beaming Cartman mistakes this for something good]

Cartman

Yes! Praise the Lord!

Kids

Praise the Lord!

+++++


Hell, River Styx Condos. Satan is talking to somebody outside

Satan

And now it's like there's one guy who's horrible to me but I'm totally sexually attracted to, and then one guy who's really nice to me but I'm not sexually attracted to at all.

JonBenét Ramsey

Wow, that really sucks.

Satan

I've asked everybody for advice, but nobody seems to know the answer.

JonBenét Ramsey

Well, there is one person who I always used to ask when I needed advice.

Satan

Who?

JonBenét Ramsey

God.

Satan

[stunned] God?? I can't do that. I haven't spoken to God in like, 5000 years.

JonBenét Ramsey

Well then, maybe it's time.

+++++


Cartman's church, day. The child congregation is singing and clapping outside and inside. Timmy is back, with a bandaged head

Kids

Do dodo dum do dodoDo dodo dum do dodo

Cartman

For he is LordLord, Lord, LordWhere are you from, little boy? [this boy wears glasses]

Boy

Boy

Yeah, that's right.

Kids

Cartman

Well, God is gonna heal those eyes, and save you from the devil begone! [smacks the boy in the face and knocks him out]

Boy

Ugly girl

Cartman

[moonwalks] Bwolololololololololololo! Oh, good Lord, somebody say "Amen!"

Kids

Amen! [the pianist is shown, with a girl singing next to him]

All

Lord, Lord, Lord

+++++


A flash of white, and the light dims enough to show clouds roiling in the sky. Satan comes up quickly, and then stops. This is heaven. A group of Mormon souls gather around him

Mormon 1

Hi hi, welcome to heaven, brother. You've followed the Mormon faith, and so you've been let in!

Satan

Uh, actually, I'm just stopping by.

Mormon 2

Well, you've picked a great time! We've got cookies and punch and we're just about to start playing charades.

Mormons

[ad lib all at once] Alright. Yeah.

Mormon 1

And then, Brother Stephen's brought his guitar so we can sing songs about how much it hurts to lie.

Mormons

Ooooh!

Mormon 3

Yeahahah!

Satan

Ah, look, I just need to talk with God. Is he around?

Mormon 2

Sure. All you have to do is say his name and he's there.

Mormon 1

I'm so grateful for that.

Mormons

[in assent] Me, too. Uh huh.

Satan

Great. Thanks. [walks off]

+++++


Heaven, a separate area. Satan walks into it and turns to the camera

Satan

[clears his throat] Ah... Hello? G-God? It's uh... Satan. [quickly shields his eyes as a sphere of light descends towards him]

God

[in silhouette] Yea. Look upon me, and know me.

Satan

Hi, God.

God

Hello, Satan. [has a body made from bits of some of the creatures he created] It's... been a long time.

Satan

Yeah.

God

What brings you here? Do you wish to mount your unholy war against heaven?

Satan

No, I have a problem, and I... need your advice.

God

You want to rule more than hell? You want to destroy the Earth?

Satan

No, it's kind of a long story but, well, it all started when this Iraqi dictator, Saddam Hussein, [God scratches behind his left ear] was killed by a pack of wild boars. I remember when I first met him in hell. It was a lovely morning in April...

+++++


Cartman's church, day. Cartman leads the kids in singing and rolls on his back a few times.

Cartman

Hallelujah! Praise the Lord! And now, I'm receiving a message directly from God-uh! God is telling me that... each and every one of you is to walk up to the stage, and give me one dollar! [The clapping stops as confused faces appear in the congregation, and the music quiets a bit. Stan and Kyle look at each other as Cartman goes for the collection box] So I want everyone to feel the love of God by coming up heah, [sets the box at center stage] and putting a dollar in the box-ah! [kids begin to approach the stage] Come on, don't be shy! Come on now! [rolls on his back as the donations come in]

Stan

Dude, that seems kind of... weird.

Kyle

Yeah. I don't remember him saying anything about this.

+++++


Heaven, a separate area. Satan finishes his story

Satan

...And now Chris and Saddam just keep killing each other over and over and... I don't know which one to pick.

God

[considers the story, then] Jesus, what the hell happened to you?

Satan

Huh?

God

You got kicked out of here for being a headstrong rebel. And now you're a whiny little bitch.

Satan

Well, I just don't know which one to pick.

God

No, you've become dependent on relationships. So you haven't even considered the option of not being with either of them. [Satan listens] And if you're not sexually attracted to someone, you're not ever going to be. But Saddam isn't right either. He's the other extreme. You need to spend time alone so that you can find the balance, the middle ground. That's what I always do, because I'm a Buddhist.

Satan

God, you're right. You know, I've had steady relationships for the last... thousand years, and when one ends I just start another one, but... I haven't taken the time to be secure with myself.

God

Bingo. [a fly gets near him and he snaps his tongue out to catch it and eat it]

Satan

Hey... Thanks, God. I forgot how clear you make things sometimes.

God

It was nice to see you again, Satan.

Satan

You too.

God

Goodbye. [turns into the sphere of light and flies up and away. Satan turns and walks off, but encounters the Mormons]

Mormon 2

Would you like to stay for some cookies and punch?

Mormon 1

Yes, would you?

Satan

Uh, no, I need to be getting back.

Mormon 2

Oh, alright then, but you're gonna miss our big play.

Mormon 4

Yes. We're going to do a play about how alcohol can ruin family life.

Satan

Wow. That sounds great, but uh, I really gotta go. [disappears in a burst of flames]

Mormon 1

Well, he seemed like a nice fellow.

Mormon 4

Yes. [a few seconds of silence follow]

Mormon 2

Let's go make things out of egg cartons.

Mormons

[ad lib] Oooh, yeah. I'll do that.

+++++


Cartman's church, day. The singing and clapping have resumed. Stan and Kyle go through some curtains to the back of the church.

Cartman

[offscreen] Yeess. [the camera looks at him, now rolling around shirtless in $1 bills, now grabbing a bunch and bathing in them] Yeess. [sees Stan and Kyle] It worked, you guys, it actually worked!

Stan

What worked?

Cartman

Eh-everybody bought the whole act! They keep giving and giving until we have it all!

Stan/Kyle

What?

Kyle

You're keeping that money yourself?

Cartman

Of course, you guys! And then we can make... ten million dollars! [grins big] Look, the tooth fairy thing didn't work, the boy band thing didn't last, so I tried this route.

Stan

Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait. You mean that this whole thing has just been a way for you to make ten million dollars?

Cartman

It all came to me days ago, when we were first in Sunday school.

Stan

[he and Kyle are now angry] Well, what about going to hell and all that?!

Cartman

Dude, if God is all-understanding, he wouldn't send us to hell. Even Sister Anne told me that.

Kyle

[points] Then why didn't you tell us?!

Cartman

My brain is of a much larger size than you guys's. I couldn't expect you to understand, not until you actually saw the cash flow!

Kyle

The only thing of yours that's larger in size is your big fat ass!

Cartman

[rolls around in the money] Suck my balls!

Stan

Dude, I am so disillusioned right now.

+++++


Somewhere in hell. Chris and Saddam are fighting once again. Saddam charges at him with a gray brick

Saddam

Die, pussy! [smashes the brick on Chris's head, and they both fall]

Chris

Ow..! [gets up, grabs one of Saddam's legs, and pulls it off]

Saddam

Aagghh! [gets up, grabs his leg back and beats Chris over the back with it. Chris falls on his face]

Chris

Aagghh! [grabs one end of the leg, and now it's a tug of war. Satan arrives and sees the battle]

Satan

Guys, guys, guys! [the two rivals stop and face him] Look, you both can stop fighting now! I've made a decision.

Chris

You have?

Satan

Yes. I... don't want to be with either one of you.

Chris/Saddam

What?!

Satan

Saddam, you're an asshole. And you'll never be the friend that I want. And Chris, well, you're a pussy. And you'll never be the lover I want. [Chris looks dejected] So I'm just gonna be alone for a while and learn to like myself. [Saddam sighs]

Chris

Satan. Can we go for a walk in the park?

Satan

No, I'm not going on a walk! You're a pussy, Chris, and you drive me crazy; go away!

Chris

Fine. [walks away]

Saddam

Hell, you can't leave me, Satan! I won't let you! [Satan is shocked]

+++++


Cartman's church, next day. Cartman holds forth. Stan and Kyle stand behind the collection box as kids stop by and put in their $1 donations

Cartman

Today is another day! And that's another dollar the Lord needs from you-uh! So come on up and give to the Lord-uh! [Sister Anne enters the church]

Sister Anne

[walking down center aisle] Alright kids, it's time to go. It's time for this to stop!

Cartman

Sister Anne is a blasphemer!

Sister Anne

I know you won't listen to me. That's why I brought somebody else. [steps aside. The curtains part. Jesus enters and walks down the aisle]

Kids

[in obvious awe] Wow!

Butters

Jesus!

Cartman

[worried] Uh-oh.

Jesus

Kids, you need to all stop spending all your time here and go back to school.

Cartman

[tugs on Jesus' robs, then softly] Jesus, ix-nay on the ool-schay.

Jesus

God doesn't want you to spend all your time being afraid of hell, or praising His name. God wants you to spend your time helping others, and living a good, happy life. That's how you live for Him.

Cartman

[goes for the collection box again] Ee-yes, by doing that, [brings it out] and, putting a dollar in the box-uh!

Bebe

Let's go ice-skating.

Girls

Yea! [leave their seats]

Butters

Uh, we can help Timmy learn how to ice-skate, too.

Boy

Yeah. [others leave their seats and vacate the church]

Cartman

[on his knees] No, come back! You face everlasting damnation! [the last congregant leaves the church] Wait! No! No! [pounds the floor with his fists a few times] I can't be cheated out of my ten million dollars again! God damnit!

Kyle

Serves you right, Cartman!

Stan

Yeah!

Jesus

But Eric, I think this time I have to teach you a lesson. I'm sending you somewhere to think about your sins!

Cartman

You're gonna send me to hell?

Jesus

No. Worse!

+++++


Ensenada, Mexico, day. Mariachi music plays in the background. A tour bus stops in front of Papas and Beer and drops Cartman off, then pulls away

Kenny

[rushes up to him] (Eric! Eric!)

Cartman

[sees Kenny] Aw, crap!

+++++


Hell, the park. Satan is strolling through the park in a happy mood

Satan

[encounters two men] Hi, Bob. Hi, Rick.

Rick

Hi, Satan.

Saddam

[waiting in the road] There you are!

Satan

[rolls his eyes] Awgh... Not again.

Saddam

You know you can't live without me. Now get that ass back to bed!

Satan

Saddam, I told you, I don't need you anymore!

Saddam

You can't leave me, Satan. Nobody leaves me.

Satan

Yes, I can! Raaarrr! [blasts a hole through Saddam with lightning from his index finger. Saddam falls]

Saddam

Aw, you little..prick!

Satan

Goodbye forever, Saddam!

Saddam

[coughs] What are you talking about? You can kill me, but I'll be back tomorrow.

Satan

Not this time. I asked a favor of an old friend of mine to let you in.

Saddam

Let me in where? [flames engulf Saddam and disappears]

+++++


Heaven, Saddam is whisked into it, as Satan was

Saddam

What the..? Hey, what the hell is this place?!

Mormon 5

Hello, and welcome.

Mormon 1

We're glad you made it, brother.

Saddam

Ey, who the hell are you?

Mormon 6

We're just about to do a play, about how much stealing hurts you deep inside. Come join us. [he and others crowd in on Saddam]

Mormons

[ad lib] Yes. Come on. Let's go.

Mormon 6

You're here forever. [the Mormons lift him up and carry him away over their heads]

Saddam

Nooo! N-nooooooooooo!

+++++
