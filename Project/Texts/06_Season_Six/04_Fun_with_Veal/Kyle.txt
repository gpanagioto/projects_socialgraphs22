 City kids get to go to museums for field trips. We get cow farms. Aw, dude.  Then why the hell do they call it "veal"?? What?? Yeah.  Come on, we've gotta go! 'Cause they're gonna get slaughtered tomorrow, butthole! What?! Screw you, Cartman! No! Have Butters kiss it. Awww!  Sick! I felt it on my face!  You need to freeze some of your ass off. What?  Hey. They've never been allowed to walk before. They just don't know how. Dude! How are we gonna move twenty three calves to your house? Don't be stupid, Cartman! Butters doesn't have that much blood in him! Butters had that at his house? All right! Oh, God-damnit! That's your plan? You're getting in pretty deep, dude.  So what happens now? We're with you, dude. We're with you, Stan.  ...No I won't. Well ''you'' made me eat veal and didn't tell me what it was. So go ahead and ''be'' angry, you baby calf-killing bitch! Don't panic. I'll tell you what to say.  You can tell them... Cartman, stay away from that door! But we ''will'' have to sleep, dude. Good night. We didn't realize hunger made you feel so bad.  He might be right, dude. All right! Yeah! And fried chicken!  We're eating, dude. Hey! I'm doing it to save little baby cows. I'm not gonna stop eating meat altogether.  You guys, check this out!  It is? Huh, what the hell is that? Dude! Those gaywads are on our side? Dude, are you okay? Dude, maybe we should end this. Don't give him anything! Dude!   Stan's getting worse, you guys.  Stan! It worked! They got us a truck, and an airplane, and Mr. Worf! The calves are gonna be okay! Mexico here we come!  Stan, we're almost there. You've got to hold on. Oh no! No!! Do you hear that, Stan? It worked! We've shut down the veal industry!  Whoa, dude. But, but we, we learned things, and took up a cause.
