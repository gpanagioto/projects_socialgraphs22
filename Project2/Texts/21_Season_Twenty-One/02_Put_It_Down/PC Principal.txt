  Entree.  Yes, Eric, how can I help you? Well, unfortunately, this week is Distracted Driving Awareness Week at school, so you might have a hard time. A lot of people. There's more deaths now because of people on their phones while driving than ever before. Entree vous. Gary Borkovec was a good student. He didn't deserve to be taken away by someone not paying attention to the road. I don't know what more you want from me, bro. I can give you two student volunteers and one pigeon. Maybe you should. Maybe you should. All right everyone, listen up. Tonight, one of our students has put together a song about a very important issue. It's a song about how there are certain times to not be on your phone. I hope you all listen carefully.
