Get off the internet, Stanley, It's time for bed Now, Stanley. The Internet will be waiting for you in the morning. Off! Shelly, off the Internet. It's bedtime. Now, Shelly!   Randy, off the Internet. No, mister, it's time for night-night. You don't have to do all that now! You can do one more thing and then it's bedtime.   Randy, I can't get my e-mail to open. What's the matter?  What did you say?  All right, each of you take a ticket. When they call your name you can use the Internet.  Shelly, give your brother his ticket back! Randy!
