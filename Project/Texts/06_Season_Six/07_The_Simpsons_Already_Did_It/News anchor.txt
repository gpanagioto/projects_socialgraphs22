... but Hillary Clinton's ass just keeps getting bigger.  Also in the news tonight, a vandal has apparently cut off and stolen the head of the Powell statue in the South Park Town Square. The head was taken in the early morning hours and the police have no leads. This act, of course, reminded us all of the time that Bart Simpson  took the head of the Springfield statue in one of their classic episodes. Here's what some people had to say: The police say that instead of looking for the missing head, they'd rather leave it off and be reminded of the Simpsons every day. And in other news, still no cause of death found for elementary school teacher Diane Choksondik. However, doctors say that during the autopsy they did find semen in her stomach.  The autopsy is ongoing and cause of death is yet to be determined.
