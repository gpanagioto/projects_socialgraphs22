STAAAN!! Get up! Get your shoes on! Gotta get out of here! MOOVE!  Shelly, go get my gun!! JUST GET THE GUN!!  Unh, come on!  A cartoon...! A cartoon is about to air on American television with... with the Muslim prophet Mohammad as a character!  SO?! Stanley, Mohammad is sacred to the Muslim people.  Ever since those cartoons in Denmark, the rules have changed. Nobody shows an image of Mohammad anymore. Who do you think?! The cartoon that's always pushing buttons with their careless toilet humor! ''Family Guy''! Because ''Family Guy'' doesn't care who they insult! They only care about their... ''precious money!'' We stay here through the night, wait it out to see if they do anything. If we're still alive in the morning,  then we'll know we're not dead. We're alive?? We're alive!  Well, it looks like we've dodged a bullet.  I DAMN YOU TO HELL!!! Well what are we gonna do, Mayor?! Part 2 of the ''Family Guy'' episode airs in six days! I like the sand idea. It's the best say, Stanley. Did you eat your Fruit Roll-Up? All right, make sure your snorkel is working.  All right, now get your head in the hole. Stanley, there's no time for your immaturity! Do it!
