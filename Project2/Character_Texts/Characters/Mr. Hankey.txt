Howwwwdy-hoooo. Howdy-ho, Kyle. Gosh, you're looking swell. You know something, Kyle? You smell an awful lot like flowers. Not real? Well shucks. If I weren't real, could I sing this jolly Christmas song? Howdy-ho! You should be wearing socks to sleep, Kyle. You're gonna catch a cold. Aw, gee, that's too bad. Say, that sounds like a swell idea. We can show everyone the true spirit of Christmas. Howdy-ho! Golly, that isn't very nice. I'd sure like to teach him a lesson. Mmmrrr-aaarrrggghhh!!! Kyle! Howdy-ho. Hoooowwwwwdy-ho!!! Howdy, folks. Gosh you sure do smell all nice and flowery. Howdy-ho, Chef! What's all the ruckus? I reckon this could be a job for Mr. Hankey! STOP FIGHTING!! Come on, gang, don't fight. You people focus so hard on the things wrong with Christmas that you've forgotten what's so right about it. Don't you see? This is the one time of year we're s'posed to forget all the bad stuff, to stop worrying and being sad about the state of the world, and for just one day say, "Aw, the heck with it! Let's sing and dance and bake cookies". Howdy-ho, Kyle!!! I brought some friends with me. Well, I've got a loong night ahead of me. Bye-bye and Merry Christmas. 
 Ky-yle! Ky-yle!  Hooowwwdy ho!  Ky-yle!  Ky-yle! Hooowwwdy ho! Howdy-ho, boys. Gosh, look at yuh. You're all growin' up sho fasht. Have you all been brushing behind your teeth? And usin' dental floss? And washin' behind your ears? Oh, I just got a little cold is all. All these new people in South Park are stressful on my home. Well, you see, boys, the sewer is a fragile ecosystem. These new folks in town eat nothin' but cous cous, tofu, and raw vegetables, and it's destroying my environment. That's why, Kyle. That's why. There's only one time of year I can come to the surface, and that's Christmastime. That's why I need you boys to go for me. Don't forget to change your sheets once a week!  Oh, Kyle. Howdy-ho. Well, how did it go? Is everyone gonna stop poopin' in my environment?  Oh. I, I see. Welluh shucks, Kyle, I can't thank you enough for tryin'. Aw I can't. The sun'll dry me out. But I won't last long up above. All right, just let me get my toothbrush.  No, I'm not leaving without you. We started this together, we're gonna finish it together.  Kyle. Be-fore I go there's something I must tell you. Come clo-ser. Clo-ser. There is a-nother Sky-walk-er. Wake up. Come clo-ser. Clo-ser. Closer! One time, when you were sleeping, I put myself in your mouth and had my friend take a picture.  Kyle. Howdy-ho. That was delicious. Hooo''ooowwwdy''-ho! Howdy-ho, folks. I'm afraid my buddy Kyle was right. There's not enough room in South Park to accommodate a festival. Uh, folks, please. Little towns like this simply aren't ''made'' for friggin' films. We love havin' visitors, but golly, too many of you is hurtin' our ecosystem. Be-sides, folks, film festivals shouldn't be about what celebrities are comin' or what film is gonna get sold. It should be about people gettin' together, and watchin' movies, and about people who could never get their movies seen havin' a chance to have it watched, if only once. A ''good'' film festival should be something where we all say, "Gaw, let's forget about lawyers and managers and studios and celebrities. Let's forget ''all'' those things for just a while, and just watch some new art."  Nyyaarrrr!  Hi, Chef. Your big chocolate balls are just the trick!  Gosh. I guess I don't know my own strength. I couldn't have done it without you, Kyle. Kisses. 
<poem><i>Christmastime has come!</i></poem> Howdy-ho, folks. We're gonna do somethin' a little bit different tonight. Instead of our normal thing, we're just gonna sit back and enjoy some holiday songs. And if ya don't like it, well, I guess you can suck my tiny little balls. So let's start off with a festive Hanukkah song, sung by my favorite Jewish person in the whole world. Woohoo! Golly, that sure was fun. But now, for our next song, hold on to your bootstraps, 'cause we're gonna descend down into Hell! Well, that was a nice little song, wasn't it? But let's not forget that for some people Christmas is about the birth of Jesus. So now, here's a more serious Christmas song, sung by Eric Cartman. Well, oh boy, that was a super song! And now, let's hear from the school teacher, Mr. Garrison. Golly, that sure was swell. I'd say my Christmas special is going super-fantastic. Well, now it's time to hear from perhaps the two most important people of the whole season. <poem><i>Hang a shining star upon the highest bough. </i></poem> Goodbye, everybody,  
Hoowwddyy ho!  Oh, no I'm fine, Kyle. I know, Kyle. I've just been awfully busy with my family.  Honey! Boys, I want you to meet my wife. Autumn. They're too young to drink, honey. Come. You have to meet the little nuggets, too. Kids!  This is our son, Cornwallis. Our daughter Amber. And our son, Simon.  Simon's not so smart. He was born with a peanut in his head. Nothin', Simon. It sure has been tough. Nobody seems that into Christmas out there. Well don't worry kids! I'm sending the nuggets up tomorrow to spread Christmas cheer!  And if you want, you can help them. Honey, pleh, you're- you're drunk. Onkay? Honey, can we go inside for a second?  Well, it's decided, kids. Tomorrow we're gonna bring back the spirit of Christmas! Now you put that vase down! Put that vase down! That's a very expensive vase!   Oh, Kyle! Hoowwddy ho! Oh, that's swell! Kids!  Christmas is back on! We've gotta all go get that old drive-in workin' again.  Wha- why do you, why do you have to say things like that in front of people? Good luck, Kyle. And we'll have that projector workin'! Don't you worry!  Cornwallis, we've got to go fix up the drive-in.  Hey, that's alright, Cornwallis. The boys' animated movie will being back the spirit of Christmas. But son, you're a Hankey. We ''love'' Christmas!  We're having a talk, honey. Autumn, you're drunk. Alright, now, just go help the other kids; they can't get their stockings up. ...Now come on, son. Don't be so down. Christmas is about feeling good. That's for everybody! No, you're ''not'' a part of it, Cornwallis. You're all of it. Don't you see?  you. <poem><i>Becomes the grass of tomorrow</i></poem>  Down here! My family and I are here to get the drive-in ready for the biig movie.  Uh-uh, honey, please don't start! They're not real, you know. Oh, big secret! Everyone can tell they're made of silicorn! Okay! Boy, oh boy, this place suuure needs a lot of work. Good job, Amber. Now this place is starting to look Christmasy    It's completely destroyed! There's nothin' I can do! Boys, I uh, I'm s-, I'm sorry. It's my fault. All my fault. I got everyone's hopes up. Aw, it's too late for that, son. everyone' gone home. And I don't know nothin' about projectors. I'm just a stupid piece of crap. Aw, that was just a stupid song, Cornwallis! I was jus' tryin' to get you to stop your bitchin' Son...  No, you did it, boys! 
Gee whiz, things sure look Christmasy out here. What are you boys doin'? Well, gosh, Eric, looks like you really have the Christmas spirit!  I know someone who can help. Santa Claus! Sure. We should take this stuff to him right away! Oh, that's no problem! We just need a little Christmas magic.  All aboard the Poo Choo Express! Next stop, the North Pole! Let's go, Poo Choo Train!  ''Poo Choo Train's layin' down its tracks with a'' ''All the way and back!'' ''Christmastime wouldn't be the same without hugs and kisses and a Poo Choo Train.''  Here we are, kids. The North Pole.  That's it. Santa's Fortress of Solitude.  We need to see Santa right away on urgent Christmas business. Howdy ho, Santa! All ready for Christmas? Santa, my friends are trying to do something very special this Christmas. Tell him, Eric. All right! Hey, it looks like Santa has already made it to Baghdad.  It certainly doesn't seem very Christmasy of them. Santa! Are you alright? Hey, that's right. Jesus can save anybody. Tell Santa's workers to keep making toys. We'll have Santa back in no time! We should be able to find Jesus in no time! Hooowdy ho!  Do you know a way? Howdy ho, Jesus.  More soldiers are coming! Start the sleigh! What are you doin', Santa? Boy, things are starting to look Christmasy now! I'll help you, Santa! 
 I'm sorry, Kyle. I really thought my idea would work for you. 
 
Hooooowwwdy ho! You wanted to see me? Better hurry. We only have two months before Christmas. What? But I can barely make a good Christmas show with what I have! Offensive? What about me is offensive? Yuh... you people can't do this. Christmas is the most magical time of the year. Okay, stop. Kids, the song's called "Deck The Halls," not "Let's All Suck Balls." Mow, come on, kids. Restoration Hardware put up their Christmas decorations two weeks ago, all right? Now listen: I didn't want this either. I wanted the Denver Symphony, but they cut my budget and I'm stuck with you. Now let's take it from the top!  Oh, Kyle! Hoowwwwdy ho!  Yeah.  Yeah. It was a bad attempt at a joke. I'm sorry. Will you tell the kids I didn't mean it? The fact is, I couldn't sleep last night so I took some Ambien. Do you take that stuff? It turns your brain into oatmeal. Please, Kyle, tell the kids I didn't mean any harm. We've gotta focus on Christmas!  <poem><i>Christmas time. It's Christmas time. Christmas time. Yeah, it's Christmas time</i></poem>. Oh, I'm sooo sorry. I took Ambien two nights ago and I called the schoolkids homos. Oh-oh Jeez, did I say that? Listen, if you're tired and you can't sleep, DO NOT take Ambien. Okay? Whew! Fire me? Nonono, please. I-I'm really sorry.  My civil rights are under attack. They can't just fire me from the Christmas show! The whole thing is my creation! It was a joke. Look at me! I don't even have a dick! Get it?  Okay, okay, look, I know: it wasn't a good joke. But it really wasn't my fault. The fact is, I went home last night and I was angry. I couldn't sleep, so I took some Ambien. And then I started tweeting. Ambien messes with my head. You ever take that crap? Well, I thought maybe I could get them in a defecation lawsuit.  Rrrgh! And I never ever would have said those things about the city council, but the Ambien makes me kind of blackout. Why not?  Rrrgh! And I just thought maybe we could convince the city council to hire me back. Oh, Kyle.  Howwwdy ho. Just tryin' to find some help. There isn't a lawyer in town who will take me. Wait a minute... You! You're the son of a lawyer. You have lawyer blood inside your veins! You can help me with my defecation lawsuit, Kyle! Please, Kyle. You're the only person left who can help me. You and me, pal, we are gonna fight the system! Y-es. That was a bad attempt at a Christmas joke. That's what I said: it was a bad attempt. You wanna hear a good Christmas joke? Sorry, I got the sniffles. All I understand is it's only eight weeks until Christmas! If we don't stop wasting our time, we're all gonna miss out on the most magical part of the whole year! Oh, come on! It was a joke! That's it! That's it, I've had enough of this whole fucking sham! Fuck all you and fuck this whole system! It's Christmastime!!  Gee whiz. Thanks for comin' out with me, Kyle.  So what's the plan, huh? What you got figured out to get my job back?  Oh, it was a joke, Kyle. Sometimes, when I take Ambien, I'm really groggy and moody the next day. It's a real side effect. It's printed right on the bottle. Kyle, don't you understand this whole thing is a smear campaign? Why are people focusing on a few stupid words I said when Christmas is just around the corner?! It's like everyone's forgot about what Christmas means!  Oh my God! Kyle, that's it! The holiday spirit! And that's the point! Don't you see? What we need to do is get everyone in the Christmas mood! We can bring the whole spirit of the holidays early! Nonono. Kyle, you gotta help me! I can't do this alone! You're all I have! Even my wife left with the Nuggets 'cause of all the pressure! Please! Well, maybe just a little if I really can't sleep. Yay! It's a deal! Oh boy, Kyle, I'm so excited! We're gonna bring the spirit of Christmas to South Park! Helloooo South Park! Come on, everybody! Get over here!  The PC what-Listen! Christmas season means peace on earth and good will towards men!  What?! What are they crying about now?! Well, then tell the babies to shut the fuck up!  Who the fuck brings a Goddamned baby to a Christmas show, anyway?! Lemme go, Kyle! These people are idiots!  Kyle, listen. It was 3 a.m. last night and I still hadn't slept, so I de-  Kyle? Kyle, please! They're gonna run me out of town, Kyle! They're going to erase me and everything I ever did. Kyle, we can all be shitty sometimes. Well, everyone, I guess this is goodbye. It sure has been swell. A Poober? They have that?  Oh, you mean Lyft. Well, okay. Goodbye, everyone. I hope I brought a few smiles and a few laughs into your hearts. Hoowwwwdy ho!
