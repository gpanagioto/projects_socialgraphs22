[[Lisa Rinna]] portrayed the character in the 1998 film ''[[Nick Fury: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. (film)|Nick Fury: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'', and [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]] portrays Fontaine in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], appearing in the [[Disney+]] series ''[[The Falcon and the Winter Soldier]]'' (2021), the film ''[[Black Widow (2021 film)|Black Widow]]'' (2021), and the upcoming film ''[[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase 5#Thunderbolts (2024)|Thunderbolts]]'' (2024).

==Publication history==
The Contessa appeared prominently throughout creator [[Jim Steranko]]'s run of the ''Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' feature that ran through ''Strange Tales'' #168 (May 1968) and in the same-name comic-book series that began the following month.

An agent who threw S.H.I.E.L.D. chief [[Nick Fury]] for a loop upon their initial meeting, she quickly became his love interest, and was featured in a silent, one-page seduction sequence in ''Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #2 that famously had two panels changed, at the behest of the [[Comics Code Authority]]. In the third-to-last panel, de facto Marvel [[art director]] [[John Romita, Sr.]] redrew a telephone that had been taken off the hook for privacy, placing the receiver back in the cradle; in the last panel, an image was removed and replaced with a closeup of an item from earlier in the page — a phallic long-barreled gun in a holster:
{{blockquote|So one panel had the stereo in Fury's apartment to show there was music playing, cigarettes in the ash tray in one, there was a sequence of intercut shots where she moved closer to him, much more intimately, there was a kiss, there was a rose, and then there was one panel with the telephone off the hook, which the comic book code {{bracket|[[sic]]; "Comics Code"}} made him put back on ... [T]he last panel on that page had Nick and his old lady kneeling, with their arms around each other, and that was entirely too much for the Code, so the panel was replaced with a picture of a gun in its holster.<ref>{{cite magazine|author-link=Robin Green (producer)|last=Green|first=Robin|url=http://www.reocities.com/area51/Chamber/8346/rs91.facefront.1.html|title=Face Front!

The story was reprinted as published in ''Nick Fury Special Edition'' #1 (Dec. 1983). When reprinted again, in ''Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Who Is Scorpio?'' (Marvel Enterprises, 2001; {{ISBN|978-0-7851-0766-8}}), however, Steranko's original final panel was reinserted. In a black-and-white long shot with [[screentone]] shading, the couple is beginning to embrace, with Fury standing and the Contessa on one knee, getting up.

==Fictional character biography==
[[Count|Contessa]] Valentina Allegra de la Fontaine was a member of the European [[jet set]] and a citizen of [[Italy]]. After both her parents were killed for aiding some unspecified resistance movement, the Contessa found her life meaningless. Desiring to carry on in their places so their deaths would not be in vain, she eventually was contacted by the international espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D. and entered a training program to become an agent.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #162, "So Evil, the Night'' p.3, panel 6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

She first encountered its executive director, Nick Fury, aboard S.H.I.E.L.D.'s airborne headquarters, the [[Helicarrier]], toward the end of her training, impressing Fury by tossing him head-over-heels with a [[judo]] throw after his uttering an untoward remark about female agents.{{issue|date=April 2014}} The two eventually became lovers,{{issue|date=April 2014}} and their relationship continued for many years.
