==Fictional character biography==
'''William "Bill" Taurens''' was born in [[Camden, New Jersey]]. He was hired by Mister Kline to round up people to test an experimental serum (taken from [[Cattle|bull]]s) made out of mutated [[enzymes]] by his agent the Professor. Although assisted by Itch and Freak Face, his attempts were thwarted by [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]]. As a result, he ended up being a guinea pig for the serum which turned him into a [[humanoid]] bull. Becoming the Man-Bull, he fought Daredevil, who defeated the Man-Bull by throwing him into a wall. Man-Bull reverted to Taurens and was arrested by the police.<ref>''Daredevil'' #78-79. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Itch snuck in the Man-Bull serum into Taurens' prison cell which permanently transformed him, Man-Bull attempted to take his revenge on Daredevil and the two have clashed on several occasions.<ref>''Daredevil'' #95-96, 129, 144. Marvel Comics.</ref> He also clashed with the [[Tigra|Cat]] in a bar fight.<ref>''Claws of the Cat'' #4.

Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Man-Bull possesses immense strength, endurance, and speed, as well as resistance to injury. He has a pair of long, dense horns that are useful for fighting battles. Unfortunately, the [[mutant]] side effects have degraded Taurens' mind, from hostile normal to feral vengeance. When occupied, his body's [[adrenaline]] feedback during combat can elevate him into a hysterical, all-consuming rage, which makes Man-Bull extra dangerous.<ref>''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe'' Vol 1 #6 (June 1983)</ref> <ref>''The All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z: Update'' Vol 1 #1 (March 2007) </ref> Taurens is able to mentally command bulls and other [[Bovinae|bovine]] animals through [[Psionics|psionic]] activity, while in unstable form.

==Other versions==
===''Spider-Ham''===
In the ''[[Spider-Ham]]'' universe, Man-Bull's counterpart in this reality is a [[frog]] named the '''Bull-Frog'''.<ref>''Peter Porker, the Spectacular Spider-Ham'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>
