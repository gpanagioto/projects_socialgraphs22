Can I help you, sir? Oh, yeah, sorry, that's gone. We only sell marijuana here. Sure. New state laws say it's okay. Alright. I'll just need to see your physician's reference. Well, sir, we just can't sell the marijuana to anybody. You need a reference from your doctor to show it's necessary. I'm sorry sir, but you have to be inside the store. Selling medicinal marijuana outside the confines of an approved shop is still illegal. Look, I'm sorry, but the bill says I can't modify any existing structure. Look, can't we skip all this and just make pot legal? Everyone is just abusing this medicinal system anyway, it's ridiculous.
