Do I really have to do this, Dad? But Grandma said I could use this money to buy whatever I want. I got a hundred dollar check from my grandma, and my dad said I need to put it in the bank so it can grow over the years. Uh, what? What's all gone? What do you mean? I have a hundred dollars. Well, what can I do to get back my money-? I just opened an account. No, you just lost it all! Hey! Dad! Mom, Dad, how come there's suddenly no money? Yeah, I think I get it. Yeah, I wanna return this Margaritaville my stupid dad bought. What? So? Well can't I just return it and get the money my dad put in back? I wanna return this Margaritaville. No thanks. I wanna return this Margaritaville, and the guy at Sur la Table said that you were the company that financed it. What? Wall Street? So? 'Scuse me. 'Scuse me! I'd like to return this Margaritaville, please? My dad bought it on a payment plan that was set up by a finance company which got their principal investors from somebody here. It does? So I can return it to a bank? What?! Aargh!  I want to return this Margaritaville! My dad bought it on a payment plan set up by a finance company that got investors from Wall Street who combined it into securities sold to the banks who transferred it to you! Nnnaaargh!  Thank you. What?! Nononono excuse me! I don't understand! How can this stupid thing be worth ninety trillion dollars?! No, dude, that doesn't make sense!
