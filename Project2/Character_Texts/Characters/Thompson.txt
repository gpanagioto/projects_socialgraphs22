They're saying something like, "You can't send us away. We are the protectors." I think he said, "the furry death"? 
Hey, you damned kids!  Get the hell out of my yard! No, it's my damned garden and I'm sick of you kids dressin' up and havin' talks of betrayal in it! 
Hey! I told you kids to stay out of my damn yard! Yeah?! Well how come every time you talk to somebody, it's about betraying somebody else?! Don't believe it!  He said that to a bunch of people! ''You're'' callin' the cops?! You're on my property! ''I'm'' callin' the cops!  Hahaa! How's it feel?! Now who's walking who through the betrayal garden?! Why don't you stay the fuck out of my yard?!  
He's lying to you!  They're just acting like they've given up, but it's a double-bluff! They're gonna betray you at the Red Robin wedding! He got the idea watching ''Game of Thrones!'' They're gonna lock you in! He talked about it in my garden to like three other people! They're gonna lock you in the Red Robin and go get all the XBoxes! That's why he wants you to stay back from the doors! Fuck you, get out of my garden! Go fuck yourself!  
 Hey! Fuck you!
