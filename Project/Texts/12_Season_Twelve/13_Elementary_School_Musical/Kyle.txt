What's ''High School Musical 3''? Are we the only ones here who are completely confused? They just released part 3 in theaters and it made 80 million opening weekend. I'm not doing it either. Kenny? I swear What happened? I thought you were gonna kill yourself. Aw man. You're not copying ''my'' homework, you lazy turd. What? Are you crazy? We promised each other we would never do that, remember? Stan, you're just jealous of that third grader and you think Wendy's gonna go for him unless you start singing and dancing too. Well, I had to see it to believe it! We said we wouldn't be a part of this fad and look at you! You know what? At least Scott Malkinson has some self-respect! At least Scott Malkinson doesn't cave into peer pressure and start doing musicals! <poem><i>Do what you want, don't have restraint.</i></poem> Where did everybody go?
