I'm gonna do whatever I can... to get that episode pulled before this gets out of hand. Kyle, stop it! So long, Kyle! Ma'am, I need to speak to the president of this network right away. It's regarding ''Family Guy''. I demand that the Mohammad episode be pulled before it airs tonight! It's incendiary, it's offensive to Muslims, and people can get hurt! It's wrong! It's WROOONG! Dude, can I go before you? So... you don't like ''Family Guy'' either, huh? So what's your plan? You're gonna ask the president of the network nicely to take it off the air? Look, kid, if you hate a TV show, all you have to do is get an episode pulled. Pretty soon the show is compromised and it goes off the air. Yes. So my plan is to use this whole Mohammad thing as a way to ''scare'' the network into pulling tonight's show. I'm going to use fear to get them to do what I want. ...No, it isn't like terrorism. It IS terrorism. This is manipulation at its highest level; you should let me handle this. Really? What's the worst thing you've ever done? Wow, that's pretty hardcore. Geez. That's like this one time, when I didn't like a kid, so I ground his parents up into chili and fed it to him. Seeya.  Hello, gentlemen, ladies. My name is little Danny Pocket. And I won't take much of your time. Please excuse my tiny crutch; it's the only way I can get around these days. Ow... You see, my father worked for a newspaper in my native country of Denmark. His newspaper showed an image of Mohammad and, two days later, terrorists suicides bombed his building. I was in the lobby when it happened.  Ow.. I'll certainly do my best.  Ow.  Yes, and then ''Family Guy'' is as good as dead.  It won't take long, sir.  Ow...  Yes, I'm totally excited. ''Family Guy'' is so funny.  What are they? ''Family Guy'' is written by manatees?  Of course, it all makes sense now. Waitwaitaminute waitaminute. These... manatees demanded that Mohammad be shown? How? Manatees don't talk! Oh... yes, yes. Um  hello, manatees. I, I think you should allow the network to pull your episode with Mohammad. See, I'm the victim of a, a terrorist attack and... terrorists might come after you if you- Why not?  Son of a bitch.  Hello, Kyle. Looks like you've run into a little snag in your plan as well. You came so close to stopping me, didn't you, Kyle. There was just one thing you didn't count on: that more people besides me hate ''Family Guy''. Not yet! But I've come up with a new plan. I've learned how to make the ''Family Guy'' writing staff stop working! As soon as everyone goes on their lunch break, I can sneak back in. Good, Kyle! That's good anger you're showin' there! See that?! That's emotional character development based on what's happening in the storyline! Not at all like ''Family Guy''. Now, if you'll excuse me, Kyle,  I've got some idea balls to remove from a manatee tank.  Sir, ''you'' are in charge of this network, not them. Maybe it's time you showed them who's in charge. I did it. I... AM... ''GOD''!!! ''Family Guy'' is going off the air! No more ''Family Guy'' for me, mon fr√®re! How the hell did you get out? Aw, God damnit, you gave him one of your gay little speeches, didn't you?! You're too late, Kyle! The president of the network is pulling the episode! ''Family Guy'' is as good as dead!  I can't let you do that!  Ugh. Kyle! Stop it! Ow. Quit it, Kyle! Bleh. Kyle!  Stop it! Ow. Quit it, Kyle! Leh- Kyle! Let go- Okay okay come on, time out. Kyle, time out! Time out! Time out.  I d-ow! Uh. Ah. Sh-gah. Okay. Okay. Time out! Kyle t-time out! Time out! Time out! Time out! Time out! Time out! Time out! Time out, Kyle! Ay! Ay! Kyle! Kyle! Get the... Get the- Kyle! Kyle, dude, that was- that was in the balls! Dude, serious- seriously! That was in the balls! No hitting- No hitting in the ''balls''!  Go ahead, Mr. President! Continue what you were doing! No! Think about the people who could get hurt! Okay, I'll make it easy for you.  Pull the Mohammad episode, now! Shut up, Kyle! Give the orders to pull the episode, Mr. President! No gay speeches, Kyle! No! No, I hate ''Family Guy''!!
