 I can't die! No, Stan, I'm being serious! I really, really can't die!  Like last night, in the alley, the cult leader stabbed me and I bled all over the place! And you screamed "Oh my God," and you called him a bastard! All the time! I die all the time! And you assholes NEVER REMEMBER! Well you don't! I die over. And over! Only to wake up in my bed like nothing happened!  I knew there'd be no point in telling you guys.  Pretty cool?! Do you know what it feels like to be stabbed?! To be shot?! Decapitated?! Torn apart?! Burned?! Run over?! It's not pretty cool, Kyle! It fuckin' hurts! And it won't go away, and nobody will believe me!  You guys have no memory of me shooting myself in the head, do you? What we need to do is talk to people in that cult! I wanna know where my powers come from. Will you guys listen to me?! I actually have a power that I actually want to know about! What are you doing with that thing?! I don't know, but... I feel like... I've... been here before.  Alright, you guys hide as long as you can. I'll try and find help.  I'm going to try to get you all out of here. If this works. Or, I could be wrong.  Ow! That fucking HURTS!  How to I fight him?  That god you pray to just took away all my friends. How do I fight him?! Tell me what that means!  Old Ones? That's it! That's the place I just was! And what about Cthulhu's power? Why can't Old Ones die? Wherever Cthulhu is! Maybe, but with any luck I might find the reason for my powers. You don't understand! Hey, fat boy! To the sunken city of R'Lyeh fallen from the stars!  You little fucking prick! What is wrong with you?! What kind of sick fuck does that to his friends?! You are the bad guy, fat boy! YOU! For you! You're making it a better place for you! No! This is what superheroes do!  Bring back my friends! Take me!  Here's your prize! Take this curse away from me, you big pussy! Go on! Kill me before I kill you! But bring my friends back, wuss! No! Come back! I have to know what I am! Come back! Come back, you fat piece of shit!  Yeah. I'm tired, guys. I think I'm gonna go to bed.
