==Fictional character biography==

===Garth===
{{Main|Garth (comics)}}
Years ago, King Thar and his wife Queen Berra became the reigning monarchs of Shayeris, the capital of a group of Idyllist colonies in the Hidden Valley. Radical Idyllists deposed and murdered King Thar and banished his pregnant wife Queen Berra to Poseidonis, the capital city of [[Atlantis (DC Comics)|Atlantis]]; there she gave birth to Garth, a child with purple eyes. Superstitious Atlanteans claimed that Garth had been born genetically inferior due to his purple eyes and banished him to a barren seabed leagues away from Atlantis. He survived and later befriended [[Aquaman]], the sometimes outcast King of Atlantis. He was a founding member of the [[Teen Titans]], and later became known as Tempest.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Aqualad's first animated appearance was alongside Aquaman in [[Filmation]]'s 1967 [[animated series]] ''[[The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure]]'', as well as in the Teen Titans shorts that were part of the series. The ''[[Aquaman (TV series)|Aquaman]]'' cartoon series of 1968 was a repackaged 30-minute version featuring primarily (but not exclusively) Aquaman and Aqualad. He was voiced by [[Jerry Dexter]].
* Aqualad has also appeared on the ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Wil Wheaton]]. His first appearance was in "Deep Six" where he, [[List of minor characters in the Teen Titans animated series#Tramm|Tramm]], and the Titans defeated [[Trident (DC Comics)|Trident]]; here and in his other appearances, he demonstrates telepathic control of sea life. In "Winner Take All", Aqualad demonstrates the ability to control water by means of Hydrokinesis. In the series, he serves as a [[Titans East]] member, a short term crush of [[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]] and [[Starfire (Koriand'r)|Starfire]], and a temporary rival to [[Beast Boy]]. He is now an official member of Teen Titans' sister group, Titans East, with [[Bumblebee (comics)|Bumblebee]], [[Roy Harper (comics)|Speedy]], and the twins [[Más y Menos]]. He appears in a cameo in the movie after the series, ''[[Teen Titans: Trouble in Tokyo]]''. As the Titans travel to [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]] he comes out of the water and waves to them.
* Aqualad also makes eight appearances on the comic series based on the show. In his first appearance in ''[[Teen Titans Go! (2004 comic series)|Teen Titans Go!]]'' (issue #10), he searches for [[Aquagirl|Gill Girl]]. He told the Titans that she used to have a crush on him, but he looked at her like a sister.
