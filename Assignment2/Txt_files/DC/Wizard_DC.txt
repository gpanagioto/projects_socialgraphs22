==Fictional character biography==
Born approximately 1913, William Asmodeus Zard grew up living a life of crime. As a gun man for various crime bosses, he ultimately ended up in jail. With the passage of time, he formulated a strategy to become a specialized kingpin. In order to accomplish this task, he moved to Tibet and trained under a proficient [[lama]] in the mystic arts of illusion and deception. Upon completion of his training, he proceeded to slay his master. Returning to the United States, he embarked on a career as a criminal [[Magician (fantasy)|magician]]. Believing that the [[Justice Society of America]] was merely a cover for a criminal organization, he first offered a reward of $1,000,000 to them in the paper under the alias W. I. Zard, later asking to join them. To prove to himself that they were not really criminals, the Wizard attempted several criminal acts which were thwarted one by one by members of the Society. Realizing his misconception, he tried to destroy them with his illusions, but was stopped by [[Charles McNider|Doctor Mid-Nite]]'s blackout bomb.<ref>''All Star Comics'' #34. DC Comics.</ref>

The Wizard helped to form the [[Injustice Society]] with [[Per Degaton]], [[Vandal Savage]], [[Thinker (DC Comics)|Thinker]], [[Gambler (comics)|Gambler]], and [[Brain Wave (character)|Brain Wave]], which engineered five jailbreaks. Each member proceeded to steal some key item from the U.S. government while leading an army of prison escapees, taking control of a portion of the American midwest, and collectively they captured their heroic counterparts, with the Wizard capturing [[Wonder Woman (Earth-Two)|Wonder Woman]] and [[Johnny Thunder]]. However, [[Alan Scott|Green Lantern]] was able to outwit Brainwave who believed him to be dead after he fell into a ravine, though his [[Power ring (DC Comics)|power ring]] saved him at the last moment, and free the rest by impersonating the Thinker who he had captured, who was acting as a [[judge]] in the 'trial' of the JSA, where the Wizard was acting as [[prosecutor]]. The Wizard's escape was circumvented by some junior fans of the JSA.<ref>''All Star Comics'' #37. DC Comics.</ref>

The Wizard proceeded to escape prison once more and reformed his gang with new members [[Icicle (comics)|Icicle]], [[Fiddler (comics)|Fiddler]], [[Sportsmaster]], [[Paula Brooks|Huntress]], and [[Harlequin (character)|Harlequin]]. Each member would try and commit a 'patriotic crime', steal a historical item, and the leader would be voted for by the American people. The Harlequin, as it turned out, was actually not a criminal at heart; she merely kept up the pretense in order to attract the attention of [[Alan Scott|Green Lantern]]. The JSA were captured after being knocked out by the Sportsmaster's bomb and having their memories removed. Along with aspiring Justice Society member the [[Black Canary (Dinah Drake)|Black Canary]], the Harlequin soon freed the heroes and restored their memories with her hypnotic glasses. However, a subliminal message had been left to restore the members to their mindless state when they heard fingers snapping, allowing the Injustice Society to recapture them when they attempted to stop the crimes. The Wizard, during the crimes, stole the [[Freedom Train]]. The JSA were placed in a chamber in which they would soon be killed. However, their memories were restored again, by the Black Canary, and they captured their foes.<ref>''All Star Comics'' #41. DC Comics.</ref>

In the late 1940s, the Wizard was contacted by [[Colonel Future]] to help get revenge on Earth-Two's [[Superman (Earth-Two)|Superman]] by removing him from existence and given the Glastonbury Wand, which had once belonged to [[Merlin (DC Comics)|Merlin]] and had been stolen by Future's henchmen. The Wizard accidentally eliminated only his memory of being Superman, but his Clark Kent identity remained. In 1950, Clark married [[Lois Lane]]; Lois realized he was Superman after seeing evidence of his invulnerability. Lois found the Wizard, who was now homeless and unable to perform acts of magic due to his shattered confidence at not being believed that he was responsible for Superman's disappearance. She convinced him to restore Superman's memory, after which the Wizard was happy to be sent to jail because he was now publicly known to have successfully removed Superman for a "couple of years".<ref name="Action Comics #484 - Pre-Crisis">''Action Comics'' #484. DC Comics.</ref>

The Wizard soon escaped and visited the Black Canary, exacting revenge on her for interfering with his second Injustice Society by granting the powers of a sonic scream to their baby daughter also named Dinah Lance. This [[Black Canary (Dinah Laurel Lance)|girl eventually grew up to become the second]] [[Black Canary]].<ref name="auto">''Justice League of America'' #219–220. DC Comics.</ref>

The Wizard proceeded to form a new villainous organization known as the Crime Champions, which teamed up with their counterparts on [[Earth-1]] to battle the Society and [[Justice League of America]]. The villains used a vibration device accidentally discovered by the Fiddler to escape to the other Earth after committing robberies. The Wizard escaped [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]] and Black Canary during a million-dollar robbery. He disguised himself as [[Doctor Alchemy]] using his magic and the rest of the Earth-2 criminals disguised themselves as the Earth-1 Crime Champions. He battled [[Superman]] and [[Green Arrow]], and helped trap the J.L.A. in their headquarters with magic. On Earth-1 he battled [[Hawkman (Katar Hol)|Hawkman]] and Black Canary and was beaten again, before being finally defeated by [[Aquaman]], [[Wonder Woman]], and the Earth-2 Flash. Years later, he again reformed the Injustice Society which were temporarily victorious, enlisting the aid of extra-dimensional writer [[Cary Bates]] in killing several members of the J.S.A prior to their being revived.<ref>''Justice League of America'' #123–124. DC Comics.</ref>

By the 1970s, Zard and the other Injustice Society members invaded the Justice Society headquarters, severely injured [[Hourman (Rex Tyler)|Hourman]] and staged a crime spree that spanned the globe. They were later apprehended.

Soon, he and the Injustice Society members went to Earth-1 to recruit younger villains to fight the Justice Society. The Wizard went there with the Fiddler, but once on Earth-1 he unexpectedly found that his sorcerer's powers began to weaken. Apparently, the travel from Earth-2 to Earth-1 caused the effect; the reverse happened with the [[Phantom Lady]], who gained intangibility power when she traveled from [[Earth-X]] to Earth-1.<ref>''Freedom Fighters'' #1. DC Comics.</ref>

On Earth-1, the Wizard was recruited into [[Darkseid]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains]], which he later took over with other villains who revolted. The Wizard was later apprehended and sent to jail, where his powers largely faded. After escaping from prison, the Wizard reformed the Secret Society and tricked them into obtaining four magical relics: the Cloak of Invisibility, the Power Glove, the Power Stone, and the Dragon Box. Unable to control the Dragon Box, the members of the Society were captured, but the Wizard incorporated the remaining three items into his new costume. The Wizard led the Secret Society back to Earth-2 in a plot to capture the JSA, which was a success when they captured the [[Atom (comics)|Atom]], [[Doctor Mid-Nite]], and [[Mister Terrific (comics)|Mr. Terrific]]. The JSA were alerted and defeated them.<ref>''The Secret Society of Super-Villains'' #7–15. DC Comics.</ref>

The Wizard was responsible for a coup in which his Secret Society, consisting of himself, [[Eobard Thawne|Professor Zoom the Reverse-Flash]], the [[Floronic Man]], the [[Blockbuster (DC Comics)|Blockbuster]], and [[Star Sapphire (comics)|Star Sapphire]], switched bodies with members of the JLA. This happened in ''[[Justice League of America]]'' #166–168, a storyline that was revisited in ''[[Identity Crisis (DC Comics)|Identity Crisis]]'' (2004), where it was revealed that Zatanna wiped the heroes' secret identities from the villains' minds following their defeat.

The Wizard later returned to Earth-2, once again reassembling the Crime Champions with the help of Johnny Thunder of Earth-1, but was once more defeated by the combined might of the JSA and JLA.<ref name="auto"/> He later appeared briefly during the JSA's trial before congress for allegations of misconduct during World War II, but was quickly defeated by [[Doctor Fate]].<ref>''America versus the Justice Society'' #2. DC Comics.</ref>

Sometime later, he moved to Canada and joined with the Fiddler and the [[Shade (character)|Shade]] as well as new villains the [[Icicle (comics)|Icicle]] II, [[Artemis Crock]] (later called the [[Tigress (DC Comics)|Tigress]]), the [[Harlequin (comics)|Harlequin]] III, and [[Hazard (DC Comics)|Hazard]], to form the group [[Injustice Society|Injustice Unlimited]], the second incarnation of the Injustice Society, where they fought [[Infinity, Inc.]] and the [[Global Guardians]]. The Wizard was presumably killed by the second generation Hourman, Zard still had the trick of faking his death.<ref>''Infinity Inc.'' #34–36. DC Comics.</ref>

Of course, this too was an illusion, and he had transported himself to the land of Faeries where he could recoup his power base. Once more, he was defeated by an assemblage of heroes and by his own ego.<ref>''Infinity Inc.'' #50. DC Comics.</ref>

The Wizard appeared in the ''JSA All-Stars'' miniseries in which he disguised himself as the villain Legacy and captured the elder members of the Justice Society. He was then "killed" by the Spectre.

Shortly after ''Identity Crisis'', [[Despero]] gave the surviving Secret Society members their memories back. In the ''JLA'' story, "Crisis of Conscience", the Wizard appeared as part of a reformed Secret Society of Super Villains looking to avenge themselves against the forced erasure of their memories. Aided by [[Felix Faust]], they attacked the ''Daily Planet'', and were stopped once again by the Justice League. After defeating Despero at Wayne Manor, the League was disbanded and Zatanna re-wiped the memories of all six Society members.

He has since appeared in ''JSA: Classified'' as part of a new Injustice Society that includes the [[Icicle (comics)|Icicle]], the [[Tigress (DC Comics)|Tigress]], [[Solomon Grundy (character)|Solomon Grundy]], the [[Gentleman Ghost]], the [[Rag Doll (character)|Rag Doll]], and [[Johnny Sorrow]] and gained possession of the key to the Ghost Zone.

During the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', the Wizard was again seen in the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]].<ref>''Villains United'' #2. DC Comics.</ref>

He showed up again fighting under the command of [[Johnny Sorrow]] as part of the [[Injustice Society]].<ref>''JSA All Stars'' #2. DC Comics.</ref>

In the DC Universe following the end of the "[[DC Rebirth]]" brand, Wizard was seen as a member of the Injustice Society when Hawkman and Hawkgirl recount their time in the 1940s when the Justice Society fought the Injustice Society. Wizard faced off against Green Lantern and was defeated by him.<ref>''Hawkman'' (vol. 5) #27. DC Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Wizard originally only knew the secrets of illusion, hypnosis and astral projection. In later times, he is a skilled magic user capable of performing various effects. Maybe his highest power degree was when he possessed the Wand of Glastonbury. He came into possession of the key to the Ghost Zone allowing him access to another dimension and teleportation through it.
