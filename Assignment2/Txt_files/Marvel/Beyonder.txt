The '''Beyonder''' ({{IPAc-en|b|i|ˈ|ɒ|n|d|ər}}) is a fictional cosmic entity appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by writer [[Jim Shooter]]<ref name="Rivera">{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|title=Go big or go home: Why Marvel's new 'Secret Wars' could be too much|first=Joshua|last=Rivera|date=October 10, 2014|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2014/10/10/go-big-or-go-home-why-marvels-new-secret-wars-could-be-too-much/}}</ref> and artist [[Mike Zeck]], the Beyonder first appeared in ''[[Secret Wars]]'' #1 (May 1984) as an unseen, self-proclaimed omnipotent<ref name="beyond dimensions">{{cite web|url=https://i.servimg.com/u/f35/19/00/38/35/beyond12.png|title=Official Narration for Secret Wars 2|website=I.servimg.com|access-date=3 November 2018}}</ref> being who kidnapped the heroes and villains of the [[Marvel Universe]] and had them do battle on another planet called [[Battleworld]].

The character later appeared in a more antagonistic role in the 1985 sequel ''[[Secret Wars II]]'', in which he took human form, and threatened to destroy the Marvel multiverse. Although he first took on a physical, humanoid form in ''Secret Wars II'' #2, it was in ''Secret Wars II'' #3 that he took on the preferred form which he used for the rest of his existence, that of a human male with curly black hair. Although the character seemingly met his demise at the end of ''Secret Wars II'', he has subsequently appeared in stories well into the 2000s.

==Publication history==
Created by writer [[Jim Shooter]]<ref name="Rivera"/> and artist [[Mike Zeck]], the Beyonder first appeared in ''[[Secret Wars]]'' #1,<ref>{{cite web|title=New 'Secret Wars' is Marvel Comics' major event of 2015| first= Brian| last= Truitt| date= October 9, 2014|work=[[USA Today]]|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2014/10/09/marvel-comics-secret-wars-event-exclusive/16987121/}}</ref> as an unseen, apparently nearly omnipotent being.

==Fictional character biography==

===''Secret Wars''===
The Beyonder is the sum total of an entire multiverse,<ref>{{cite web| url= http://i39.servimg.com/u/f39/19/00/38/35/41498710.jpg | title= [Excerpt of synopsis] |format= Comic book | publisher= Marvel Comics | access-date= August 28, 2017| via= servimg.com}}</ref> called the Beyond-Realm or simply "Beyond", hence the name ''Beyonder''. This dimension was originally believed to be accidentally accessed by lab technician Owen Reece when some of the energy from the dimension escapes and imbues Reece with infinite powers, which he wields as the villainous [[Molecule Man]]—potentially one of the most powerful characters in the universe. The remaining energy of the pocket dimension gains sentience and curiosity, and it becomes the Beyonder. The Beyonder creates a planet called [[Battleworld]] out of pieces of various planets (one such piece being a suburb of [[Denver]], [[Colorado]]) and abducts a number of [[superhero]]es and [[supervillain]]s from Earth and forces them to fight each other so that he can observe the never-ending battle between good and evil. During this time, his powers were once stolen by [[Doctor Doom]].<ref>''Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars'' #10 (Feb. 1985). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===''Secret Wars II''===
Intrigued by what he has witnessed during the first Secret Wars, the Beyonder comes to Earth during the ''[[Secret Wars II]]'' story line to walk among humans and study them and learn of human desire firsthand. He creates a human body for himself (this body originally resembles Molecule Man). He also transforms a television writer named Steward Cadwell into [[Thundersword]].<ref name="SWII#1">''Secret Wars II'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Finally, the Beyonder creates a form for himself based on that of [[Captain America]] after witnessing him defeat [[Armadillo (comics)|Armadillo]].<ref>''Captain America'' #308. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After learning of the importance of money from [[Luke Cage]], the Beyonder turns a building into pure gold,<ref>''Secret Wars II'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> causing [[Spider-Man]] to rescue those trapped in the building, while the U.S. government works to get rid of the gold to avoid a financial crisis.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Beyonder later meets the blind superhero [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] and restores his ability to see, asking for legal representation in return. After realizing that the desire to protect his eyesight might compromise his integrity and dedication, Daredevil demands that the Beyonder take his sight away again, which he does.<ref>''Daredevil'' #223. Marvel Comics.</ref> Beyonder then attempts to get [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Dazzler]] to fall in love with him, but fails, leading to feelings of despair.<ref>''Secret Wars II'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> Following this, the Beyonder is recruited to be a professional wrestler and is nearly killed by [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] in a wrestling match.<ref>''The Thing'' #30. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In order to combat Beyonder, [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] sent his demon agent Bitterhorn to form the Legion Accursed where he managed to get 99 villains together upon shaking their hand. While waiting for the Legion Accursed to arrive, Mephisto tricked Thing into signing a contract that would increase his strength. When the Legion Accursed had arrived, Thing had to defend Beyonder from them. By the time Mephisto planned to drop his contract with Thing, nearly all of the Legion Accursed were defeated. Due to Beyonder and Thing ruining his plan, Mephisto returned all the villains to where they were before he began his scheme.<ref>''Secret Wars II'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After being encouraged to find enlightenment by [[Doctor Strange]], and failing, a frustrated Beyonder decides to destroy the entire multiverse, leading to several more battles with various Marvel superheroes, all of which end up with the Beyonder victorious. The Beyonder is finally defeated by a huge group of superheroes, including the [[Fantastic Four]], [[X-Men]], [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], and [[Spider-Man]], after the [[Molecule Man]] intervenes and kills him, while he had temporarily transformed into an infant in the midst of a re-birthing process.<ref>''Secret Wars II'' #9. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===''Deadpool Team-Up''===
Long after the ''Secret Wars II'' crossover had ended, a [[Deadpool]] special featured the "Secret Wars II continues in this issue" corner tag that was used during that original storyline. In this issue, a younger, less-experienced Deadpool is hired by the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] to kill the Beyonder. The flashback sequence ends with Deadpool chasing him into a portal with a footnote saying "to be continued in Secret Wars III".<ref>''[[Deadpool]] Team-up'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Kosmos and Maker===
The tale of the Beyonder continues several years later when it is revealed that the energy which comprises the Beyonder and the energy that gives the [[Molecule Man]] his powers needs to be combined in order to create the basis for a mentally stable, mature cosmic entity to be born. The Beyonder then merges with the Molecule Man.<ref>''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #319. Marvel Comics.</ref> This being, [[Kosmos (Marvel Comics)|Kosmos]], expels the Molecule Man from its form, and returns him to Earth. Kosmos takes on a female form and is tutored by [[Kubik (comics)|Kubik]], touring the universe with him.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' Annual #23. Marvel Comics.</ref> When the Molecule Man's lover [[Volcana (Marvel Comics)|Volcana]] leaves him, he becomes angry, extracts the Beyonder from Kosmos, and proceeds to attack him until Kubik intervenes.<ref name= "FF27"/>

At some unknown point, Kosmos becomes insane and assumes a mortal form, now calling itself the Maker. After the [[amnesia]]c Maker destroys a [[Shi'ar]] colony, the [[Imperial Guard (Marvel Comics)|Imperial Guard]] manage to imprison it in the interstellar prison called the [[Kyln]]. The Maker's madness takes control of several inmates but is finally subdued by [[Thanos]] and several of his allies among the prisoners. Thanos confronts the Maker, and, by refusing to reveal its origins at a critical juncture, manipulates it to psychically shut down its own mind. Thanos instructs the Shi'ar that the body should be kept alive but brain-dead, or the Beyonder essence would go free again.<ref>''Thanos'' #10 (2003). Marvel Comics.</ref>

==="Annihilation"===
In the "[[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]]" crossover story line, the [[Fallen One]], a former [[Galactus|Herald of Galactus]] under the control of [[Thanos]],<ref>''Thanos'' #12 (2004)</ref> is sent to investigate the aftermath of the [[Kyln]]'s destruction by the [[Annihilation Wave]] and ascertain the Beyonder's fate. The Fallen One finds the lifeless form of Kosmos in the rubble.<ref>''Annihilation: Silver Surfer'' #1 (April 2006). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===The Illuminati===
[[File:Beyonder - by Jim Cheung.jpg|thumb|right|170px|The Beyonder in his human form. Art by [[Jim Cheung]].]]
In a [[retcon]] of past events, [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]] reveals to his fellow [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]] members that in the original Secret War, he had attempted to mind-scan the Beyonder, revealing him as one of the [[Inhumans]] previously ruled over by fellow Illuminati member [[Black Bolt]]. Xavier also deduced the apparent secret behind the Beyonder's seemingly godlike abilities, which was that the Beyonder was not only an Inhuman but also a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], and the exposure of his mutant genes to [[Terrigen Mist]]s had created an unprecedented power.<ref>[http://www.popcultureshock.com/new-avengers-illuminati-3/41826/ "New Avengers: Illuminati #3 Preview"]. Pop Culture Shock. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830031726/http://www.popcultureshock.com/new-avengers-illuminati-3/41826/ |date=August 30, 2010 }}</ref>
	
This revelation leads to a confrontation with the Beyonder during the events of the second Secret War, wherein Black Bolt expresses his extreme displeasure toward the Beyonder's activities. When encountered, the Beyonder is dwelling in a simulacrum of Manhattan Island on [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], a [[dwarf planet]] in the [[asteroid belt]].<ref>''New Avengers: The Illuminati'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Illuminati convince the Beyonder to leave the universe, causing the Beyonder's human form and his simulacrum city to crumble into dust. However, Black Bolt admits that he has no memory of an Inhuman becoming the Beyonder, and the final image of the story reveals that the entire event was in the pupil of the Beyonder's right eye. He may have only been orchestrated it just to entertain himself, leaving his true nature in doubt.{{issue|date=May 2018}}

===Time Runs Out===
It was revealed in ''Secret Wars Official Guide to the Marvel Multiverse'' that in the distant past, the enigmatic [[Beyonders]] created [[pocket universe]]s holding vast amounts of sentient energy, possibly as incubator units for their young. Some were later tapped into by various beings, including [[Skrull]]s and Humans, to create reality-warping [[Cosmic Cube]]s. The Beyonders also had engineered an accident that created a pinhole to the universe containing the "Child Unit" Beyonder which had also caused Molecule Man to obtain his power. [[Hank Pym|Yellowjacket]] described the Beyonder as a "child unit" to the Beyonders.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 3 #30 (April 2015). Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''Secret Wars Official Guide to the Marvel Multiverse'' #1 (Oct. 2015). Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Beyonder is an [[Hilbert space|infinite-dimensional]],<ref>''Secret Wars II'' #2 (Aug. 1985). Marvel Comics.</ref> or [[Theory of forms|beyond-dimensional]],<ref name="beyond dimensions"/> entity and was originally portrayed as the most powerful being in the Marvel Comics multiverse, and as the be-all and end-all of the "Beyond Realm",<ref>''Secret Wars II'' #8 (1986). Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://i.servimg.com/u/f35/19/00/38/35/beyond10.jpg|title=Jim Shooter in an Interview for Secret Wars 2|website=I.servimg.com|access-date=3 November 2018}}</ref> that took human form to better understand the nature of human beings.<ref name="SWII#1"/>

The narration stated that he possessed power millions of times greater than the entire multiverse combined,<ref name="SWII9">''Secret Wars II'' #9 (March 1986). Marvel Comics</ref> and that a regular universe was a drop of water in the ocean compared to the Beyond Realm.<ref name="SWII4">[http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20140812053848/powerlisting/images/1/15/Stan_Lee_called_beyonder_omnipotent_.jpg ''Secret Wars II'' #4 (Oct. 1985)]. Marvel Comics</ref>

The Beyonder proved capable of destroying, and recreating, the abstract entity known as [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]] across the multiverse, although it extremely exerted and weakened him to do so. However, even in this state, he was capable of easily sending a horde of demons back to hell with a wave of his hand.<ref>''Secret Wars II'' #6 (1985). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Despite his power, the Beyonder has shown moments of vulnerability. He was overwhelmed when [[Rachel Summers]] returned the enormous powers that he had bestowed upon her along with the thoughts of the past and present beings in the universe, to the point that he collapsed on the ground,<ref>[http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/56904/2226158-beyonder_vs_phoenix2.jpg ''Uncanny X-Men'' #203]. Marvel Comics.</ref> and he was apparently slowed down in battle against the [[Molecule Man]].<ref>[http://media.animevice.com/uploads/0/4813/274235-moleculeman_super.jpg ''Secret Wars II'' #9 (1985)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150220114551/http://media.animevice.com/uploads/0/4813/274235-moleculeman_super.jpg |date=2015-02-20 }}. Marvel Comics.</ref> He also lost part, or all, of his power on various occasions, some of them engineered by himself.<ref name="SWII9"/><ref name="SWII4"/><ref>''Secret Wars'' #10 (Feb. 1985). Marvel Comics.</ref> He also stated that the [[Puma (comics)|Puma]]—when in perfect harmony with the Universe—was capable of killing him.<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #111. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, on another occasion, after trying to be a superhero by fighting a superpowered biker gang, the Beyonder stated that he limits his powers to keep them more in line with the world around him.<ref>''Dazzler'' #40 (Nov. 1985). Marvel Comics.</ref>

After his creator, [[Jim Shooter]], left Marvel, writer-editor [[Tom DeFalco]] re-tooled the Beyonder, diminishing his power greatly: He was no longer nearly omnipotent, and several of the cosmic beings who were previously established to be below him in power were vastly upgraded in conjunction.<ref name="FF27"/><ref>''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe'' vol.2 #7 (June 1986). Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''Fantastic Four'' #319 (1988). Marvel Comics.</ref><ref name="FF23"/>

Nonetheless, the Beyonder retained his reality-warping powers, allowing him to control and manipulate matter, energy, and reality at a cosmic level beyond all but the strongest and most powerful of cosmic entities.

He repelled [[Galactus]] "like a bug",<ref name="SW1">''Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars'' #1. Marvel Comics</ref> and exceeded the collected energy of the latter's World-Ship.<ref>''Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars'' #10. Marvel Comics/</ref> He once destroyed a galaxy on a whim to meet his needs during the first Secret Wars,<ref name="SW1"/> and later created a universe out of his own being.<ref name="FF319">''Fantastic Four'' #319. Marvel Comics/</ref> When the Molecule Man extracted the Beyonder from Kosmos, their battle took place in more than three spatial dimensions, and threatened to cause vast destruction across the multiverse.<ref name="FF27">''Fantastic Four'' Annual #27 (1994). Marvel Comics/</ref> In Kosmos' 'Maker' incarnation, she was stated as capable of reversing [[Antimatter#Conceptual history|The Crunch]] itself, essentially collapsing the entire universe.<ref>''Thanos'' #10-12. Marvel Comics/</ref> However, his scale of power was stated to be significantly below that of the [[Living Tribunal]] and [[Eternity (Marvel Comics)|Eternity]],<ref name="FF319"/> the [[Celestials (comics)|Celestials]],<ref name="FF23">''Fantastic Four'' Annual #23 (1990). Marvel Comics.</ref> or the Molecule Man (when unfettered from his emotional weaknesses).<ref name="FF27"/>

==Other versions==

Marvel Comics</ref> Later, he attempts to hold captive the ruler of the Universal Church of Truth, [[Protege (comics)|Protégé]]. Protégé retaliates using his limitless ability to copy the abilities of other beings to become a match for the Beyonder. They battle until Eternity and The Living Tribunal intervene.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Guardians of the Galaxy #50|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref>

==="Heroes Reborn"===
In an alternate reality depicted in the "[[Heroes Reborn (2021 comic)|Heroes Reborn]]" miniseries, a character named '''Mister Beyonder''' appears as an inmate of the [[Negative Zone]] before escaping and confronting  [[Hyperion (comics)|Hyperion]], claiming that his reality is not what it seems.

* The Beyonder appears in the final episodes of ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'', voiced by [[Earl Boen]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/Earl-Boen/|title=Earl Boen - 70 Character Images|website=Behind The Voice Actors|access-date=3 November 2018}}</ref> This version is an associate of [[Madame Web]]. In the three-part episode "Secret Wars", to prepare [[Spider-Man]] for the Chosen One's role, the Beyonder teleports [[Doctor Octopus]], [[Doctor Doom]], [[Alistair Smythe]], the [[Lizard (character)|Lizard]], and the [[Red Skull]] to a peaceful alien planet and accelerates time until after the supervillains conquered it. After providing Spider-Man with a base, he and Madame Web watch him lead [[Captain America]], [[Iron Man]], [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]], and the [[Fantastic Four]] into battle against the supervillains. Amidst their conflict, Doctor Doom learns about the Beyonder and steals his powers, but is defeated by Spider-Man and the [[Ben Grimm|Thing]]. Beyonder declares the former the winner and sends everyone else back to Earth with no memory of the battle. In the two-part series finale "Spider Wars", the Beyonder and Madame Web assemble [[Alternative versions of Spider-Man|Spider-Men from several alternate realities]] and task them with defeating [[Carnage (comics)|Spider-Carnage]] before he destroys all of reality. While they succeed, the Beyonder is forced to return to his world after teleporting [[The Six Arms Saga|Man-Spider]] back to his universe when he threatens the mission.
* The Beyonder appears in the ''[[Avengers Assemble (TV series)|Avengers: Secret Wars]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Steven Weber (actor)|Steven Weber]].<ref>{{cite episode|title=Beyond|series=Avengers: Secret Wars|network=Disney XD|season=4|number=17|airdate=January 14, 2018}}</ref> This version creates Battleworld out of other worlds as part of his experiment. In "Beyond", he recreates [[Stark Tower|Avengers Tower]] for the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] before informing them of Battleworld. In "Underworld", the Beyonder manipulates [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]] to sow chaos and splits the [[Hulk]] and Bruce Banner apart before sending the two to Battleworld. In "The Citadel", the Beyonder tasks [[Ares (Marvel Comics)|Ares]], [[Absorbing Man]], [[Black Widow (Yelena Belova)|Crimson Widow]], and [[MODOK]] with bringing Iron Man and Captain America to him. While his enforcers fight the latter, the Beyonder tries to convince the former to be a part of his experiment. In reality, he manipulates Iron Man and Captain America to fight each other. However, he failed to anticipate their subterfuge until they escaped with his information. Enraged, the Beyonder takes his anger out on his enforcers except for Ares. In "The Wastelands", the Beyonder has Ares and an army of [[Ghost Rider]]s hunt down the Avengers' two groups for attempting to undo Battleworld, eventually resulting in [[Jane Foster (comics)|Thunderstrike]] personally defeating him.
