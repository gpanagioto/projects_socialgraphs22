==Publication history==
{{expand section|date=November 2016}}
Created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]], the Wrecker made his first appearance in ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' #148 (January 1968).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=129}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Dirk Garthwaite, a.k.a. '''the Wrecker''', first appeared in ''Thor'', and is depicted as a former [[manual laborer]] for a [[demolition]]s crew who is fired for his violent and anti-social tendencies. Garthwaite created a [[costume]] for himself and called himself the Wrecker, committing a series of [[robberies]], demolishing looted locations and leaving a [[Crowbar (tool)|crowbar]] at the scene of the crime.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wells |first1=John |title=American Comic Book Chronicles: 1965-1969 |date=2014 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1605490557 |page=198}}</ref> The Wrecker entered a [[hotel]] room occupied by [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]] god [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]], the [[adopted]] brother and archenemy of the Thunder God [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. Upon knocking out the de-powered Loki, the Wrecker put on his helmet and received an [[Incantation|enchantment]] from Loki's ally, [[Karnilla]] the Norn Queen, who assumed he was Loki because the Wrecker was wearing his helmet and she only saw him from the back. Therefore, Karniila was the source of his newfound enchanted powers. Reveling in his power, the Wrecker embarked on a crime spree and defeated Thor who, at the time, had had his power severely reduced by his father [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]] (ruler of the [[Norse mythology|Norse]] gods) as punishment for choosing to remain on Earth. A building collapsed onto the Thunder God, nearly killing him. The Wrecker was defeated by the [[Asgardians (Marvel Universe)|Asgardian]] goddess [[Sif (Marvel Comics)|Sif]], who animated the [[armor]] of the Asgardian [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer]] to save Thor. The Wrecker's crowbar was shattered.<ref>''Thor'' #148 - 150 (Jan. - March 1968)</ref>

The Wrecker returned and battled Thor again, although a fully restored Thor easily defeated him.<ref>''Thor'' #171 (Dec. 1969)</ref>

The Wrecker returned in ''[[The Defenders (comic book)|The Defenders]]'', and this time appeared with three superpowered partners in crime: [[Bulldozer (comics)|Bulldozer]], [[Piledriver (comics)|Piledriver]] and [[Thunderball (comics)|Thunderball]]. Empowered when holding the crowbar as it is struck by [[lightning]], the villains joined the Wrecker to become the [[Wrecking Crew (comics)|Wrecking Crew]].<ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |page=375}}</ref> While searching for a [[gamma bomb]] built by Thunderball with which they hope to [[extort]] [[New York City|New York]] City, the Wrecking Crew battled several members of the Defenders: [[Doctor Strange]]; [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)|Nighthawk]] and the [[Hulk]].

During the ''[[Avengers: Standoff!]]'' storyline, the Wrecker was an inmate of Pleasant Hill, a gated community established by S.H.I.E.L.D.<ref>''Captain America: Sam Wilson'' #7</ref>

The Wrecker was then seen among a group of supervillains who heard from the Wizard that Doctor Doom had gone straight, only for Doom to arrive and defeat them single-handed. The Wrecker is later seen in S.H.I.E.L.D. custody, where he is interrogated by the Thing.<ref>''Infamous Iron Man'' #7</ref>

The Wrecker and the rest of the Wrecking Crew were seen as members of the Hood's gang as the Wrecking Crew led the attack on Castle Doom. The Wrecker and Thunderball were taken down by Doctor Doom in his Iron Man armor until the Hood showed up with the rest of his gang and shot him with one of his enchanted bullets. As [[Rampage (Marvel Comics)|Rampage]] and [[Shockwave (comics)|Shockwave]] held him down, the Wrecker was ordered to rip open Doctor Doom's Iron Man armor. As the Wrecker prepared to do the final opening move, Victor von Doom disappeared in a bright light, leaving the armor behind.<ref>''Invincible Iron Man'' #597-598</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Courtesy of an Asgardian enchantment placed on him by mistake by Karnilla the Norn Queen, the Wrecker possesses superhuman strength, stamina and durability ([[bulletproof]]). When he initially shares the Norn power with the rest of the Wrecking Crew, the Wrecker's abilities were reduced by one-fourth. After receiving training from Ulik the Rock Troll, the Wrecker no longer suffers from this handicap and is now capable of using his powers to their full potential and use the crowbar in the same fashion that Thor can utilize his mystic hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]]. He has used the crowbar to demolish entire buildings in minutes and to hold off the Thunder God Thor in battle. The Wrecker primarily uses the crowbar offensively as both a throwing and blunt weapon. While the Wrecker is the true source of the power, at times the power can be transferred into the crowbar.

The crowbar's secondary abilities include absorbing and projecting energy, creating [[illusion]]s, generating a [[Force shield|force field]], creating minor [[earthquake]]s, [[teleportation]] and returning to the Wrecker when thrown. The Wrecker also shares a mental link with the crowbar and can mentally control any weak-minded individual who touches it. The Wrecker was also able to temporarily mystically impart superhuman strength to the individual and surround him/her in an impenetrable force field around that person that would protect that person until the individual reached the Wrecker. The individual would be in a trance-like state while they were holding the crowbar and under the Wrecker's control. The trance would be broken once the crowbar was in the Wrecker's possession and the person would have no memory of their experience with the crowbar. The Wrecker is the most powerful member of the Wrecking Crew and while many believe his crowbar is the source of their powers (Thunderball thought that when he attempted to steal the crowbar, until his hand was crushed by the Wrecker in a "friendly" hand-shake while the crowbar was in Thunderball's possession), it is the Wrecker ''himself'' that is the source of the Wrecking Crew's powers, especially after Ulik's training.<ref>''Thor'' #418</ref>

==Other characters named the Wrecker==
* The first Marvel supervillain known as the Wrecker fought Giant-Man and the Wasp in ''Tales to Astonish'' #63. He was a two-bit shake-down artist who wore a hood and used DDT and bear traps for weapons. Even at the time, Stan Lee knew this villain was not up to par: "Can we confess something to you? We feel 'The Wrecker' was kind of a weak Giant-Man tale!"<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #63</ref>
* There was also a man named Karl Kort who went by the name the Wrecker in ''The Fantastic Four'' #12. This issue is also famous for depicting the first meeting between the Fantastic Four and the Hulk.<ref>''The Fantastic Four'' #12</ref>
