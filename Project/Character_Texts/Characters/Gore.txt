Focus. Calm. Center.  Yes! Die! Die, you pins! Oh, we've got a straggler, do we? You're gonna die just like the rest of 'em. Focus. Calm.  That's a name I haven't heard in a long time. Oh. Sucks for you.   Oh, is it inconvenient now? I tried to warn you all, but no one took me cereal. You all just made fun of me, didn't you? Well, now you can just deal with it yourselves. You stop it all those years ago when I freaking warned you and you still had time! Say you're sorry for making fun of me. Say you're sorry for making fun of me. That... didn't sound cereal at all.  Aw, thanks, guys! You shouldn't have! What did you guys get me?  Hang on!  Who said anything about stopping MBP? Yeah, to make up for ripping on me! I've moved on from this life, okay?! I have a new life now! I'm a bowler!They're my family now! We're wanted in Blackwater, and we have to move our camp soon! Yeah, it's amazing. Only thing is I have all these stolen items and I don't know how to sell them.  This is it. Every piece of information I ever gathered on ManBearPig.  Hoho! I thought that once too. I wanted to find ManBearPig's origins. And so I created this - the Internet. With that, I was able to look everywhere for any bit of data, and what I learned is that ManBearPig... is a demon.  Oh my God. I should play Red Dead on this computer, with all three screens. That'd be so bitchin' sweet. Why does the Devil do anything? He's the freakin' Devil. He's a dick.  All I can say is... you boys better get to the grocery store, 'cause it's time... to get cereal. Abuul abash mayah. What Satan has put forth upon this earth, may it be summoned and banished forever.  We call upon the powers of darkness. Come on, guys. We call upon the powers of darkness. Al Gore was right. Al Gore was right all along. We should have listened to Al Gore. It's Instagram Live. Keep going! We should have taken Al Gore more cereal.  You were saying? Here he comes, boys! Prepare yourselves!  Yeah, no doi! What'd ya think we were doing?!  Prince of Darkness! It is I, Al Gore! I was almost President! A demon from Hell has been unleashed upon our world! We demand to know its nature! We demand to know its reason for coming! Ah! You are correct.  Your local library is an excellent resource for whatever you wish to learn. Then I command ye, Satan, to come with us to the local library! And I am cereal! You're playing Red Dead Redemption 2? No. They don't listen to me, kids.  You must convince people there's a ManBearPig, which Satan told you is a Fate Sifter demon that made a deal with someone in this town! Yeah, sounds really hard, doesn't it? People might not believe you and like, make fun of you and stuff. Poor you guys, huh?  
 Fear not. Do not give up on yourself. You must keep believing. It's me. Al Gore. You cannot lose faith, my child, even though everyone is ripping on you. Even though they don't believe you and they're saying you're just seeking attention because you lost the Presidency. You have to be strong! No! not dead! Just merely using a flashlight on the glass to apply the Pepper's ghost technique. You see my point? Things aren't always as they appear. You have to stay strong, my little crusader. I did, too. Didn't get it.  What's that? See you later, alligator.  Oh yeah, you're real cereal.  All I was doing was trying to be your mentor. You know who my mentor was? Me! Al Gore!  And in conclusion, let me just say that you are the future. You cannot give up hope. I brought you all together because I believe in you. Did you guys like my movie? Exactly. I'm trying to get you to ask "What would Al Gore do?" Yes, to get you all to not give up. To get you to fight!  Hey, what are you doing? No, they're depending on me! I'm depending on you, goofball!
