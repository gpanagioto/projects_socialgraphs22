We've got to do it, J. Your ratings are being killed by the ''Jimbo and Ned Hunting Show''. Wuhell, you'd better care, Mr. Smarty Pants. No ratings means no show. If you want to keep reaching out to people, you ''have'' to keep up with the times. Remember, big, big, big!. Jesus! We're in trouble. ''The Jimbo and Ned Show'' made up some ridiculous staring frog story and jumped another two points in the ratings! I don't know. We'll have to continue with the changes we've made, and then go even further. Remember, big, big, ''big!'' Ooh, no, no, no, no! This is the biggest publicity stunt I've ever seen! ''Damn'', those hunters are clever! It's genius, it really is. Hell, I even want to watch them hunt the Mexican staring frog. Unless...  Unless we can prove to the City world that the whole thing is a sham. If we prove that the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka is just something..made up by Jimbo and Ned, we can have them taken off the air. Perhaps even killed!  Oh, J. You are so omnipotent, and yet so naive. We'll launch a full investigation, and in the meantime, we can cash in on the video tapes. Good. Okay. Okay, bye! Good news, everybody. This week's ratings are through the roof! We're up to twenty people! No, but I do. We're now the highest-rated show on Mountain Cable Access! God bless the Mexican staring frog! We'll start with a two-shot of you and Ned getting your equipment together and-- What is it? He is? You getting all this? Get the Flight for Life helicopter!  Oh, this is not good. You're ''corpses'' out here! We need a lot more action from everybody! Like, go ahead and tell how your nephew Stan takes drugs and worships Satan. And you kids! I didn't bring you on this show to be boring. Somebody get pissed off and throw a chair at Ned here. Remember, you all start to fight ''after'' the chair is thrown. That's your cue. What is this? ''What's happening?!''  Oooooohhhh! Noooooo!
