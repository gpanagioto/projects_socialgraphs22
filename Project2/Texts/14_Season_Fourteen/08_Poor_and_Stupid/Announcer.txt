We're just seconds away from the start of the Denver 300.  Let the race begin! It looks like the Dale Evans car is going the wrong way! We are now live at the NASCAR press conference, where the drivers of Saturday's race are gearing up and taking questions from reporters.   The drivers are slowly heading out to follow the pace car. It looks like a woman is trying to take over for Jimmie Johnson's car.  They are neck and neck approaching the finish line.  Big celebration for the Lowe's Home Improvement team.
