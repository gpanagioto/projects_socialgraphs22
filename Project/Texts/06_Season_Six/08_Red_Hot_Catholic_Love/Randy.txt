  ahem. 'Scuse me. Look, I just don't think it's the best idea to let our boys to go on a c-cruise with the priests. With everything that's been in the news, I think it's best to keep our kids... far away from the priests. It couldn't hurt.  You know, I think we've just had it with the Church. All the horrible things they've done to kids, I... I think I'm gonna become an atheist! Well uh, let's, let's just be atheists. Yeah!  Stan, you're an atheist now! Oh boy, now that we're atheists we don't have to pray for our food. Noho, it doesn't work that way, son. No it doesn't. Honey! Honey, come quick! Well, Sharon and I are havin' a great time bein' atheist. I for one can't believe I used to live my life by what a very old and very fictional book used to say.   And we can't let the religious right corrupt our kids. Great news, Stan! The Vatican is burning down!  He's right, Sharon. We don't have to believe every word of the Bible. They're just stories to help us to live by. We shouldn't toss away the lessons of the Bible just because some assholes in Italy screwed it up. Gang, I think maybe we, owe God an apology. No. It means we get to, son. It means... we get to. }}
