I can't believe it's been two weeks since I've seen you guys. What have you been doing?  Hey Bebe.  Oh my God, Bebe. You got boobs! ...But I was like, "I'm not buying those shoes for twenty dollars."   Stan, you've never asked me to throw rocks at cars with you guys.  Oh, for Christ's sake!  "The new Cold War." But, then the mall closes at four or five o'clock, so who knows w-  No! Can you believe Bebe? She thinks she's so cool all of a sudden. I heard that her asshole is like this big around.  Oh, hey Bebe.  Slut. Oh, no, that's okay Bebe. You might trip and then we'd be sucked into your huge gaping vagina like ants into a vacuum cleaner.  Slut. Slut. What are you doing?! ''I'm'' class president! The vote was last fall! She's not smarter and cooler than everyone, you guys are just drawn to something else!  Ugh! God, you guys are sooo stupid!  Yes! I want to get breast implants! That's what ''I'' said. I have three thousand dollars, cash.
