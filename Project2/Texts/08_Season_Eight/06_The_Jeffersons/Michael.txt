You see, I- I didn't have a childhood, so I'm really just a child myself. Here, everything's okay. I want you each to have a hundred dollars.  Come on, Blanket. We have to go home and feed the animals. Bye, friends.  Come on, Blanket! All the adults are trying to get us. Get up to your room, Blanket, and put your mask on! We can't go outside anymore!
