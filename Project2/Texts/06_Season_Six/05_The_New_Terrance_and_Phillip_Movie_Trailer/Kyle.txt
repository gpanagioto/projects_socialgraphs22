Do we have everything? Look, it's almost time. It's the biggest night of the year.  Dude, why'd you make that deal? If we're out buying tampons, we'll miss the trailer anyway. You'd miss the new trailer? Kyle. Well just hurry, Butters. You can probably make it back in time before the first commercial break. Dude, thank God for stupid people  Just don't mess with it, Cartman. Just just leave it alone. God-dammit Cartman! You broke it! God-dammit! Come on, we can go watch it at my house! We made it! It hasn't gone to commercials yet.  No Ike! They're playing the trailer to the new Terrance & Phillip movie during the show, and we have to watch it!  They're goin' to show the new Terrance & Phillip trailer. But Dad, this is all the never-before-seen footage. God-dammit. Come on, guys. We gotta go to Butters' house. God-dammit! If we miss the commercials, I'll never forgive my brother! Heuh, the commercials!  Yeah, they want everyone to stick around and watch more of this retarded show. Get it back to normal, Chef! The TV left. We're not kids. We're full-grown men with dwarfism! How dare you assume that all midgets are children! We demand an apology! We're not too late!  They didn't play the Terrance & Phillip trailer '''again'''! Ugh! We're gonna end up watching this whole retarded Russell Crowe show! That's disgusting, dude! It's okay, it's still the show. Oh, dude, I don't know how long I can take it. Will your sister let us watch it? Look! Crack addicts with a television!  Oh Jesus! '''Now''' where do we go?? Well why not?! This whole time your TV is in a house with nobody in it?! The last commercial break is starting! What if they don't show the Terrance & Phillip trailer at all? What if we went through all of this for nothing? That's bull-crap! TV shows are gay! They were wearing cowboy hats!  It looks even better than their first movie, huh?
