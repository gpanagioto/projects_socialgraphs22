I can't believe it, babe. I really didn't think things would end up like this. I just... feel so disconnected from the world, you know? I really thought this was gonna be the moment that proved girls could do anything, like you always say. I'm just glad I have you. At least I know you believe girls are smart. And funny too, right? You're always saying how people need to get over that girls are funny. Hey, are you okay? This election really got to you too, huh? Me too, babe.  Me too. Hey babe. What's the matter? Okay. I know, babe. You've talked about how humankind needs to get to Mars for a few weeks now. Babe, there's no way to get to Mars right now. I trust you with everything I have. Eric, we're so far from home. You really think there's hope?
