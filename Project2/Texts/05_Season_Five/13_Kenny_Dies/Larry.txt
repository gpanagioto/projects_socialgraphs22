 Oh well, I'm sorry, but we can't buy those from you now. I'm afraid the government has just put a ban on stem-cell research. Too many people were upset about using aborted fetal tissue for a study. It's too bad, too. We really coulda helped a lot of people.  This is where the bulk of our research was being done. But due to the government ban, we're mostly just packing things up. Look, you have trillions of cells in your body: heart cells, skin cells, brain cells, and so on. But before a cell is designated as a toenail cell or a pancreas cell, it's what we call a stem cell. Sort of like a blank cell. Do you understand? Because these cells are blanks, they will often program themselves based on what cells you put around them. You see this rat? Earlier this year, we surgically removed the middle of her spine. then we injected her with some stem cells and... they became the missing part of the spine. Nerve cells damaged by Parkinson's disease or heart tissue of cardiac patients might ultimately be replaced by tissue grown from stem cells. That's the theory. Well, no. To build another Shake's it would be better to use lumber. But, unfortunately, the government has banned stem cell research and so... we'll never know. Where are you going? Hey kid.  Oh, hey kid.
