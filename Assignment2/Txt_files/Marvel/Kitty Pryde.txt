'''Katherine Anne''' "'''Kitty'''" '''Pryde''' is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]], commonly in association with the [[X-Men]]. The character [[First appearance|first appeared]] in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #129 (January 1980) and was co-created by writer-artist [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] and writer [[Chris Claremont]].

A [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], Pryde possesses a "phasing" ability that allows her to become intangible.<ref name="PhysicsofSuperheroes">{{cite book| last = Kakalios| first = James| title = The Physics of Superheroes| url = https://archive.org/details/physicsofsuperhe00kaka| url-access = registration| date = 2005-10-04| publisher = Gotham Books/Penguin Group, Inc.| location = New York| isbn = 978-1-59240-146-8}} The author, James Kakalios, is a physics professor. Pages 254-255: "With our improved understanding of physics, we can now more accurately describe Kitty Pryde's mutant power as being able to alter her macroscopic quantum wave function, increasing her tunneling probability to near 100 percent at will." Page 255: "How, when she's is 'phasing' and immaterial, can she walk?"</ref> This power also disrupts any electrical field she passes through, and lets her simulate [[levitation (paranormal)|levitation]].

The youngest to join the [[X-Men]], she was first portrayed as a "kid sister" to many older members of the group, filling the role of [[Foil (literature)|literary foil]] to the more established characters. She occasionally used the codenames '''Sprite''' and '''Ariel''', cycling through several uniforms until settling for her trademark black-and-gold costume. During the miniseries ''[[Kitty Pryde and Wolverine]]'', she was renamed '''Shadowcat''', the alias she would be most associated with, and shifted to a more mature depiction in her subsequent appearances. Pryde would eventually abandon her nickname, "Kitty", and switch to "Kate". She was one of the main cast of characters depicted in the original ''[[Excalibur (comic book)|Excalibur]]'' title. After momentarily joining the Guardians of the Galaxy, she assumed her then-fiancé's superhero identity as the '''Star-Lord''' ('''Star-Lady'''). As of the series ''[[Marauders (comic book)|Marauders]]'', she is now informally known as '''Captain Kate Pryde''' and the '''Red Queen''' of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Trading Company]]. Since her debut, Kitty Pryde has been described as one of Marvel's most notable female heroes.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |author1=Chris Arrant Contributions from Michael Doran |date=2022-08-25 |title=The best Marvel characters of all time ranked |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/marvel-characters/ |access-date=2022-09-10 |website=gamesradar |language=en}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{cite web |title=Kitty Pryde is number 47 |url=http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/47 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110508013019/http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/47 |archive-date=May 8, 2011 |access-date=May 19, 2011 |website=IGN}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite web |last=Stanford |first=Jerry |date=2021-02-19 |title=10 Best Characters John Byrne Created, Ranked |url=https://www.cbr.com/john-byrne-best-characters/ |access-date=2022-09-10 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=":3">{{Cite web |title=10 Best X-Men |url=https://comicbook.com/news/10-best-x-men/ |access-date=2022-09-10 |website=Comicbook.com |language=en}}</ref>

In the [[20th Century Fox]] [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' film series]], Kitty Pryde was initially portrayed by young actresses in cameos; Sumela Kay in ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'' (2000) and [[Katie Stuart]] in ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]'' (2003). Later, [[Elliot Page]]{{efn|name=Elliot}} portrayed the character in ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' (2006) and ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'' (2014) in full-length appearances. Pryde is ranked No. 47 in [[IGN]]'s Top 100 Comic Book Heroes.

==Publication history==
Kitty Pryde was introduced into the ''X-Men'' title as the result of a Marvel Comics editorial dictate that the series depict a school for mutant children.<ref>{{cite web|last=Grant|first=Steven|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=18546 |title=Permanent Damage - The 20 Most Significant Comics|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617050259/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=18546 |archive-date=2011-06-17 |website=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date=October 22, 2008}}</ref> ''Uncanny X-Men'' artist [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] named Kitty Pryde after a classmate he met in art school (Canada's [[Alberta College of Art and Design]]) in 1973.

[[Fantagraphics Books|Fantagraphics Books, Inc]].</ref>

The fictional Kitty Pryde first appeared in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #129 (January 1980), by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist Byrne, as a highly intelligent 13-year-old girl. Claremont said several elements of the character's personality were derived from those of ''X-Men'' editor [[Louise Simonson]]'s daughter, Julie.<ref>{{cite book| last = Defalco| first = Tom| title = Comics Creators on X-Men| date = 2006-05-01| publisher = Titan Books| page = 79| isbn = 978-1-84576-173-8}}</ref> Claremont and Byrne made the new character a full-fledged X-Man in issue #139, where she was codenamed "Sprite". She was the main character in issues #141–142, the "[[Days of Future Past]]" storyline, where she is possessed by the consciousness of her older self, "Kate", who time travels from a dystopian future back to the present to get the X-Men to help her prevent an eventual mass extermination of mutants. The six-issue [[miniseries]] ''[[Kitty Pryde and Wolverine]]'' (1984–1985), written by Claremont, is a coming-of-age storyline in which she matures from a girl to a young woman, adopting the new name "Shadowcat".

In the late 1980s, Kitty joined the British-based super team, Excalibur, where she remained for roughly ten years before coming back to the X-Men. In the early 2000s, she disappeared from the spotlight after semi-retiring from superhero work. She was featured in the 2002 mini-series ''[[Mekanix]]'' and came back to the main X-Men books in 2004 under the pen of Joss Whedon in ''Astonishing X-Men''. She remained a part of the X-Men books until 2008 when she left again for roughly 2 years. After coming back, she was featured in Jason Aaron's ''Wolverine and the X-Men'' and Brian Michael Bendis' ''All-New X-Men'' books.

In early 2015, she joined the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]. After the Secret Wars event, she adopted her new alias, Star-Lord (first believed to be Star-Lady).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/star-lady-revealed-secret-wars-ends-all-new-all-different-marvel-begins|title=STAR-LADY REVEALED, "SECRET WARS" ENDS, "ALL-NEW, ALL-DIFFERENT MARVEL" BEGINS|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160321233526/http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/star-lady-revealed-secret-wars-ends-all-new-all-different-marvel-begins|archive-date=2016-03-21|date=2015-07-14}}</ref>

In 2020, Kitty Pryde was revealed to be bisexual.<ref>''Marauders'' #12</ref> Her co-creator, Chris Claremont, had always intended this to be the case, considering [[Rachel Summers]] as a possible love interest for Pryde. However, Claremont wasn't allowed to show this at the time due to censorship, as he revealed on the "Xplain the X-Men" podcast in 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2016-03-13|title=100 – Unexpected Wonder, with Chris Claremont|url=https://www.xplainthexmen.com/2016/03/100-unexpected-wonder-with-chris-claremont/|access-date=2020-11-05|website=Jay & Miles X-Plain the X-Men|language=en-US}}</ref>

Shadowcat's popularity had a profound effect on the real-life Kitty Pryde: the latter became so overwhelmed by attention from Shadowcat fans, she abbreviated her name to K.D. Pryde to avoid association with her fictional counterpart. She has since stated she has mixed feelings about her fame, saying she values Byrne's comics for their entertainment and artistic value, but wishes more people would appreciate her as more than just Shadowcat's namesake.<ref name=cbrul42/>

==Fictional character biography==

Katherine Anne "Kitty" Pryde was born in [[Deerfield, Illinois|Deerfield]], [[Illinois]], to Carmen and Theresa Pryde. She is an [[Ashkenazi Jew|Ashkenazi]] [[Jewish-American]] and her paternal grandfather, Samuel Prydeman, was held in a [[Nazi concentration camps|Nazi concentration camp]] during [[World War II]]. Kitty started to have headaches at age thirteen, signaling the emergence of her mutant powers. She was approached by both the X-Men's [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]] and the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club's]] White Queen, [[Emma Frost]], both of whom hoped to recruit her for their respective causes. Kitty was unnerved by Frost, observing that the White Queen looked at her as if she were "something good to eat." She got along better with Xavier and the three X-Men who escorted him, quickly becoming friends with [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Ororo Munroe]]. Ororo told Kitty who she really was and about the X-Men, which made the teenager even more enthusiastic about attending Xavier's school.

Their conversation was cut short when they (along with [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]]) were attacked by armored [[mercenary|mercenaries]] in the employ of Frost and the Hellfire Club. The X-Men defeated their assailants, but were subdued by the White Queen's telepathic powers immediately after. In the confusion, Kitty was separated from the X-Men, and not captured along with them.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #129</ref> She managed to contact [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]], and [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #130</ref> With the help of [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Dazzler]] and Pryde, those X-Men rescued their teammates from the Hellfire Club.<ref name="Uncanny X-Men #131">''Uncanny X-Men'' #131</ref>

The White Queen appeared to perish in the battle, which meant she was no longer competing with Xavier for the approval of Kitty's parents. Kitty's parents had not heard from her in more than a day, because during that time she was first being pursued by the Hellfire Club's men and then working with the X-Men to save their friends. All they knew was Kitty had left with Xavier's "students" to get a soda, there had been reports that the soda shop had been blown up, and Kitty had been missing since. Therefore, they were angry at Xavier when he finally returned with Kitty in tow. At first, it seemed like there was no chance of Kitty being allowed to attend the school and join the X-Men. Phoenix then used her considerable telepathic power to erase the memories of Kitty's parents and plant false ones, resulting in a complete shift in their attitude towards Xavier. Kitty was then allowed to enroll at Xavier's school with her parents' blessing,<ref name="Uncanny X-Men #131"/> becoming the youngest member of the team.

===Joining the X-Men===
Kitty joined the X-Men,<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #138</ref> and assumed the costumed identity of Sprite.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #139</ref> Early in her career as an X-Man, Kitty's adult self from an alternate future took possession of her body in the present to help X-Men thwart the assassination of Senator [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Robert Kelly]] by the second [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]].<ref name="Uncanny X-Men #141-142">''Uncanny X-Men'' #141-142</ref> Kitty then singlehandedly defeated a [[N'Garai]] demon.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #143</ref> Kitty also briefly attended the White Queen's [[Massachusetts Academy (comics)|Massachusetts Academy]] when her parents became convinced that she needed to be with students of her own age, but following a failed attempt to subdue the X-Men, Frost revoked Kitty's admission.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #151-152</ref>

During her teen years, Kitty fostered a number of close relationships with others at the school and in the X-Men. She developed a crush on [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] and became close friends with his little sister [[Magik (Illyana Rasputin)|Illyana Rasputin]]. Initially uneasy around Nightcrawler and other mutants with physical deformities, Kitty finally overcame her fears and became close friends with him. Kitty also befriended [[Lockheed (comics)|Lockheed]], a highly intelligent alien resembling a [[dragon]],<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #166</ref> who followed her home after a mission in [[outer space]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #168</ref> Lockheed is extremely loyal to Kitty, and the two of them share a psychic bond. [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] became something of a mentor to Kitty despite his usually gruff personality. [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] came to view Kitty as the daughter she never had.

Though Xavier has threatened to reassign Kitty to the [[New Mutants]], a team of younger mutants he established in the absence of the X-Men, ever since the X-Men returned from outer space,<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #167</ref> she never ended up joining the group, who she derisively calls the "X-Babies".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Buchanan|first=Bruce |title=The New Mutants: From Superhero Spin-Off to Sci-Fi/Fantasy|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=29|page=64 |date=August 2008}}</ref> Kitty was later abducted by the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]] and nearly forced to wed [[Caliban (comics)|Caliban]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #177-179</ref> She was then abducted by the White Queen, but rescued by the New Mutants.<ref>''New Mutants'' #15-17</ref>

During this time, Kitty began to date Colossus, although this did not last long. Colossus developed feelings for an alien woman named [[Colossus (comics)#Zsaji|Zsaji]] whom he met on the [[Beyonder]]'s planet in the first [[Secret Wars]]. Colossus' feelings toward Zsaji were primarily a side effect of her own unique healing abilities, which she had used on him after he became injured. Regardless, Colossus' feelings were real and he returned to Earth consumed with grief after Zsaji's death. He admitted to Kitty that he loved Zsaji, which hurt her deeply and ended the budding romantic relationship.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #183</ref>  Kitty had made good friends with a local boy from Salem Central named [[Cypher (comics)|Doug Ramsey]] around this time, but her feelings for him never went as deep as his for her, and they never actually dated, though they remained close, even more so after Doug's status as a mutant was revealed and he joined the New Mutants under the codename Cypher. They remained friends until his death some time later.<ref>''New Mutants'' #60</ref>

===Ogun===
During the 1984–1985 ''[[Kitty Pryde and Wolverine]]'' miniseries, Kitty is possessed by a demon, the ninja [[Ogun (comics)|Ogun]]. Ogun psychically bestows upon Kitty a virtual lifetime of martial arts training. Kitty was brainwashed by Ogun into becoming a ninja assassin, and was sent to attack Wolverine. Kitty is able to resist Ogun's influence with Wolverine's help, and the two form a strong teacher/student bond, which helps them in vanquishing Ogun. Kitty returns to the X-Men, no longer the innocent girl they once knew, and officially adopts the codename Shadowcat.<ref>''Kitty Pryde and Wolverine'' #1–6</ref>

===Morlock Massacre===
While trying to save Rogue, Kitty was badly injured by [[Harpoon (comics)|Harpoon]]'s energy spear during the [[Mutant Massacre]] story arc, in the massacre of the Morlocks, with the result that she lost control of her power and was stuck in an intangible state and could not regain her solidity.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #211</ref> She was rushed to [[Muir Island]] along with other surviving [[Casualty (person)|casualties]] of the Massacre to be tended to by [[Moira MacTaggert]]. MacTaggert was able to keep Kitty's condition from deteriorating to the point where she completely lost physical substance and ceased to exist, but was not able to do any more to help her.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #212</ref>

At this time, Kitty's natural state was to be intangible. Where she once had to make a conscious effort to phase, she could now only maintain her solidity through an act of conscious will. The X-Men went to Reed Richards, [[Mister Fantastic]] of the Fantastic Four, for aid, but Richards initially refused because he was not sure he would be able to help.<ref>''Fantastic Four Vs. the X-Men'' # 1</ref>

Having nowhere else to go, the X-Men turned to Richards' enemy [[Doctor Doom]]. This created a moral dilemma for both the X-Men and the Fantastic Four, and both teams fought each other because the Fantastic Four were trying to stop the treatment while the X-Men were determined to save Kitty's life. In the end, both the personal crisis of the Fantastic Four and the life of Shadowcat were saved after [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]], with the help of Lockheed, brought both teams to their senses.<ref>''Fantastic Four vs. the X-Men'' #1-4</ref>  Kitty has since recovered from this state and now has full control over her power again.<ref name="Uncanny X-Men #227">''Uncanny X-Men'' #227</ref>

===Excalibur===
Among the others injured and brought to Muir Isle were Colossus and Nightcrawler, although Colossus left the United Kingdom shortly after being released from MacTaggert's care to join the rest of the X-Men on their mission to battle the [[Adversary (comics)|Adversary]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #225</ref> The X-Men [[Fall of the Mutants|sacrificed their lives]] to defeat the Adversary, the battle and their sacrifice was televised and broadcast across the world. The X-Men were resurrected later in the same issue, unknown to the world at large, but chose to keep a low profile and perpetuate the belief that they were still dead.<ref name="Uncanny X-Men #227"/> This strategy was enforced to more effectively fight their enemies. This meant avoiding contact with friends and family, including Kitty. Thinking the X-Men were dead, Kitty and Nightcrawler joined [[Rachel Summers]], [[Captain Britain]], and [[Meggan (character)|Meggan]] to form the [[United Kingdom|Britain]]-based team [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]] following an adventure in which they saved Rachel from [[Technet (comics)|Technet]].<ref>''Excalibur Special Edition'' #1</ref>  For a brief time, Kitty studied at St. Searle's School for Girls in Britain.<ref>''Excalibur'' #32{{en dash}}34</ref> During her time with Excalibur, Kitty developed a crush on Professor [[Alistaire Stuart]] which went unreciprocated since Alistaire was attracted to Rachel.<ref>''Excalibur'' (vol. 1) #11</ref> Later, she was romantically involved with former [[Black Air]] agent [[Pete Wisdom]].<ref>''Excalibur''vol. 1 #90 (1995)</ref> At some point Kitty was recruited by the international law enforcement agency S.H.I.E.L.D. to repair the computer system of their flying headquarters. Kitty discovered the problem was due to Ogun's spirit having infiltrated the computer system, and with the aid of Wolverine, she managed to purge Ogun's presence.<ref>''[[Kitty Pryde, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' #1 - #3</ref> During this time, Kitty was attracted to a S.H.I.E.L.D. intern her own age, and this made her begin to doubt her relationship with Wisdom.<ref>''[[Kitty Pryde, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' #2</ref> Soon after, she broke off their relationship.<ref>''Excalibur'' vol 1 #120 (1998)</ref>

===Back to the X-Men===

{{unreferenced section|date=January 2013}}
After Excalibur's dissolution, Shadowcat, Nightcrawler, and Colossus return to the X-Men. While returning, they faced a group of [[Cerebro's X-Men|imposters]] following Cerebro, in the guise of Professor X. While tracking [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]], she stumbles onto prophetic diaries that belonged to [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Irene Adler]], a precognitive. During the six-month gap, Kitty visited [[Genosha]]. Whatever she experienced there is unknown (although presumably connected to her father, living on Genosha at the time), but it had a profound effect on her. She cut her hair and began to act rebelliously, also using one of Wolverine's bone claws broken off during battle as a weapon. Kitty remained with the X-Men for a while before leaving after the apparent death of Colossus. Trying to give herself a normal life, she attended the [[University of Chicago]]. During this time, her father was killed when [[Cassandra Nova]]’s [[sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] destroyed Genosha. Kitty later finds a recording of his death due to exploring footage of the attack. She is also kidnapped by [[William Stryker]], but the [[X-Treme X-Men]] team helped her escape, and she assisted them on several missions.

At the start of [[Joss Whedon]]'s run on ''Astonishing X-Men'', Kitty once again rejoins the X-Men, despite having extreme reservations about working with the former [[Emma Frost|White Queen]], given their history. This was the primary reason why Frost herself wanted Kitty on the team, as a sort of "safety" should Frost ever revert to type. Frost reasoned that the person who trusted her least would be most likely to spot such behavior. On one of the team's first missions, Shadowcat discovered Colossus was alive. After some initial awkwardness, Kitty and Colossus resumed dating.

Kitty Pryde appeared alongside Colossus in the "Blinded by the Light" arc in X-Men. They are the two X-Men left to look after the students while the rest of the X-Men leave for [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]]'s home in Mississippi to check up on [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], during which they are ambushed by the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]]. Kitty and Colossus, meanwhile, attempt to protect the students from a faction of the Marauders led by [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]]. It is revealed over the course of the story that Kitty, worried of the Destiny Diaries' safety, devised a plan with [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and Emma Frost to hide them and have Emma wipe the location from her mind. The location could only be revealed by a code word spoken to Kitty. The arc concludes with a battle between [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] and [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]] against the Marauders for the diaries, during which they are destroyed by [[Gambit (Marvel Comics)|Gambit]].

In the "Torn" arc, the latest incarnation of the Hellfire Club begin an assault on Xavier's School. Kitty fulfilled the role that Emma Frost envisioned, personally taking down Frost and imprisoning her, only to fall under a telepathic delusion created by Hellfire member [[Emma Frost#A New Hellfire Club|Perfection]], who claimed to be the true, unreformed Emma Frost. Under this delusion, Kitty was made to believe that she and Colossus had conceived a child, which was later taken away by the X-Men because its potential mutant abilities were supposedly dangerous. Kitty reacts in the delusion by attempting to rescue the child from a near-inescapable "box" in the depths of the school, unaware that in reality she is freeing an alien entity, Stuff, who contains the trapped consciousness of Cassandra Nova, the apparent ringleader of this new Hellfire Club. A newly awakened Cyclops revealed that the new Hellfire Club, including Perfection and Nova, are actually mental projections created by a piece of Cassandra Nova's consciousness; which became lodged in Emma's mind during the X-Men's last confrontation with her, playing on her [[survivor's guilt]] over the Genoshan massacre, and utilizing Emma's telepathy to both confound the X-Men and orchestrate her (Nova's) escape from the Stuff body. As Cyclops killed the mental projections, Emma tried to force Kitty to kill her to get rid of Nova. Undeterred, Cassandra Nova switched her focus to attempt to transfer her mind to [[Armor (comics)|Hisako Ichiki]]. It appears that Nova did not succeed, as the team was transported to S.W.O.R.D.'s air station en route to Ord's [[Breakworld]] for the "Unstoppable" arc that concludes Whedon's run on ''Astonishing X-Men''.

===Breakworld===
As the team prepares to end the confrontation with the Breakworld leader, the team splits up—with Kitty on the team appointed to stop the missile pointed at Earth. Kitty phases into the missile to disrupt its circuitry noting that it is composed of the same material as the rest of Breakworld, a material that is difficult and exhausting for her to phase through. After phasing for a mile into the missile, Kitty finds the center only to discover it empty. The missile is fired, causing Kitty to pass out inside of it as [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] discovers too late that due to its shape, trajectory, and lack of internal circuitry, the Breakworld's weapon is not a missile, but a bullet. As the bullet hurtles toward Earth, Kitty lies unconscious within it.<ref name="ReferenceA">''Giant Size Astonishing X-Men'' # 1</ref>

As the situation becomes increasingly dire, Emma establishes mental contact with Kitty, reassuring her that she will come out of this fine, though it eventually becomes clear to both that the situation will be grim. Kitty and Emma come to an understanding and reconciliation, Emma stating that she never wanted something like this to happen to her. Kitty then phases the bullet through Earth, but is trapped within. At the end of ''Giant-Size Astonishing X-Men'', [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Scott Summers]] mentions that [[Doctor Strange]], [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]], and some "top men" tried to save her, but believe she has fused to the bullet, as it continues to hurtle through space. Whether she is alive or dead is unknown, though the X-Men consider her lost to them.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

As a result of these events Kitty does not appear in the X-Men crossover event [[X-Men: Messiah Complex]], since this takes place after the events of ''Giant-Size Astonishing X-Men''. She is briefly mentioned in the aftermath of the Messiah Complex, by Colossus, Nightcrawler, and Wolverine, as the three of them discuss "losing her."<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #496</ref>

To cope with Kitty's loss, Colossus takes down a group of Russian criminals dealing in human trafficking, and gets a tattoo of the name 'Katya' on his chest.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' # 507</ref> Emma begins having a recurring dream in which she hears a voice whom she believes is Kitty's trying to reach out to her.<ref>''Secret Invasion: Dark Reign'' # 1</ref>

It was later confirmed by Abigail Brand that Kitty Pryde was still alive within the bullet, but because the bullet's design would harden as time went on, it would become increasingly difficult to break the bullet open.<ref>''S.W.O.R.D.'' #1</ref>

===Return===
After the X-Men move to the island of Utopia, [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] arrives on the island professing his desire to join and support the X-Men in their effort to unite the world's remaining mutants.

Meanwhile, inside the bullet, Kitty is revealed to still be alive.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #521</ref> Unbeknownst to the others, Magneto had encountered the bullet earlier while attempting to regain his powers with the [[High Evolutionary]] and surmised that Kitty was inside. Despite this and the [[High Evolutionary]]'s apparent ability to retrieve the bullet and Kitty, Magneto chose to focus on regaining his powers, secretly keeping tabs on the bullet until his decision to draw it back to Earth. During her time trapped inside the bullet, Kitty keeps herself and the bullet phased to avoid collisions with any inhabited objects in its path.

Magneto brings Kitty Pryde safely down to Earth by cracking the bullet in two and levitating Kitty to the ground. When she and Colossus try to touch, it is revealed that she is trapped in her intangible form, unable to speak, and the X-Men place her in a protective chamber similar to the one used for her following the events of the Mutant Massacre.<ref name="Return">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Matt Fraction]] | penciller = [[Whilce Portacio]]| inker = Ed Tadeo| story = Ghostly| title = Uncanny X-Men| volume = 1| issue = 522| date = May, 2010| publisher = Marvel Comics| location = | page =| panel =| id =}}</ref><ref name="Status">{{Cite comic| writer = [[Matt Fraction]]| penciller = [[Whilce Portacio]]| inker = Ed Tadeo| story = The Five Lights Part One: Freak Like Me| title = Uncanny X-Men| volume = 1| issue = 526| date = July, 2010| publisher = Marvel Comics| location =| page =| panel =| id =}}</ref>  How Kitty survived her time in the bullet is unclear to the X-Men's science team, where the X-Men discover that all her bodily functions halted.<ref name="Status"/>  An analysis by [[Kavita Rao]] hypothesizes that Kitty created an intense [[muscle memory]] to keep herself and the bullet phased and has "forgotten" how to un-phase.<ref name="Status"/>

During a conversation with Colossus, with Emma Frost acting as the psi-conduit, Kitty picks up Emma's stray thoughts on killing the captive [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]], to prevent [[Namor]] from discovering she previously lied to him. While disgusted at Emma's intentions, Kitty offers a compromise. Due to her current ghost state, she is the perfect tool for making Shaw disappear.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #529</ref>

In a storyline in ''Uncanny X-Men'', the Breakworlders make their way to Earth. During the conflict between the Breakworlder Kr'uun and the X-Men, Kitty is slain and resurrected by Kr'uun's mate in an alien ritual, which results in her powers returning to normal.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #538</ref>

===The Black Vortex===
In the following weeks, Kitty's relationship with Peter Quill evolves more and more as they developed stronger feelings for each other every day. At one point, Quill gets captured during one of their dates and she has no option but to go to his rescue, despite her fear of space as a result of her being trapped on the giant space bullet.<ref>''Legendary Star-Lord #6'' (February 2015)</ref> After rescuing Peter, she decides to stay in space with him. Then, Kitty convinces Peter to steal a powerful artifact called [[the Black Vortex]] from his father J'son. Soon, they find themselves being chased by J'son's assassination squad, the Slaughter Lords. In despair, they request the aid of the X-Men and the Guardians of the Galaxy to protect the Vortex. After a few of their own friends can't resist the temptation and submit to the Vortex, betray the team, and escape with the artifact; the team splits and Kitty stays in Spartax to help an orphanage. She is encased in amber after Thane (who was allied with J'son) freezes the whole planet along with the people inside it; but thanks to her phasing powers, she manages to get out of the amber. Then the Brood attacks Spartax, planning to use every encased person to lay eggs and create an army of Brood to start invading other planets and conquering them. Kitty feels the only way to stop them is by submitting to the Vortex herself as she's the only one who can resist the cosmic corruption. She reluctantly submits and becomes a being of unlimited power. After being reminded of the love between her and Peter Quill, she goes back and phases all the amber that encased Spartax, along with the Broods trying to infect the people, and sends them all to another dimension. Kitty doesn't give up the cosmic power but admits to Peter that she is afraid of it. Peter promises her that he will never abandon her no matter how much she changes. Then, Peter kneels and proposes marriage to Kitty.

===Leading the X-Men===
[[File:Kitty_Pryde_X-Men_gold_3.jpg|thumb|Kitty on the cover of ''[[X-Men Gold]]'' vol. 1 #3 by Marc Guggenheim, art by [[Ardian Syaf]].]]
Upon returning to Earth, Kitty hopes to finally regain a semblance of a normal life but ends up approached by Storm, who informs Kitty of [[Inhumans vs X-Men|everything the X-Men have gone through while Kitty was away]]. Storm announces to Kitty that she intends to step down as leader of the X-Men due to the guilt that she feels for leading the X-Men to war and offers Kitty her position. After touring [[X-Mansion#X-Haven|X-Haven]] and seeing how much things have changed and how much things need to change for the better, Kitty agrees to lead the X-Men as long as Storm remains on the team. Her next act is to relocate the mansion from [[Limbo (Marvel Comics)|Limbo]] to [[Central Park, New York]] so the X-Men can refocus on being part of the world instead of fearing it under the belief that if the X-Men truly are to be seen as heroes, then they need to actually live in the world that they are trying to save instead of constantly worrying about their own survival.<ref>''X-Men: Prime'' #1</ref>

Under Kitty's new leadership, the X-Men go through some small changes in order to shed their history and make new names for themselves, such as convincing [[Rachel Summers]] to change her code name to Prestige and renaming the mansion as The Xavier Institute for Mutant Education and Outreach. Kitty learns first-hand how hard it is to balance leading the X-Men as well as managing the mansion when there are many political factors trying to deliberately get in the way of the X-Men. She also begins to have awkward one-on-one moments with Colossus; they try to remain friends, but given their long history their interactions swiftly become complicated. Kitty's first case as field leader of the X-Men sees her and her team taking on a new Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. After discovering that an outspoken anti-mutant politician brainwashed this new Brotherhood to work for her to publicly discredit mutants, Kitty threatened to expose her if she continued exploiting mutants for her own personal gain.<ref>''X-Men: Gold'' Vol. 1 #1-3</ref>

===Dawn of X===
After Krakoa became a new sovereign nation for Mutants, Kitty Pryde, now going by Captain Kate Pryde, discovers she is the sole mutant who is, for unknown reasons, unable to use the various warp gates leading to Krakoa. It is implied that she has done something to anger Krakoa, but that restriction does not mean Kitty cannot use other means to reach the mutant homeland. She steals a boat and sets sail for the island. Kitty's time on Krakoa proves to be just as fruitless, as the island's natural resources (like flowers that grow into biome homes) are similarly prohibited to Kitty. Emma Frost comes asking Kitty to take up a special mission: taking a bigger boat out to serve as pirate captain on the X-Men's mission to liberate mutants trapped in oppressive countries that do not recognize mutant sovereignty, while also smuggling and supplying for Emma's Hellfire Trading Company the lifesaving drugs the X-Men provide to humans.<ref>''Marauders'' #1</ref> Kate Pryde is later appointed the new Red Queen of the Hellfire Trading Company by Emma Frost, to the dismay of Sebastian Shaw.<ref>''Marauders'' #2</ref> Seeing Pryde as an obstacle to his complete control of the Hellfire Corporation, Shaw began plotting against Kate and her crew. After taking notice how Emma became overprotective of the newly crowned Red Queen, Shaw realized that for the same reason she can't travel through Krakoa's gates nor read or understand the Krakoan language until Emma implanted it in her brain, the X-Men's Resurrection Protocols also won't apply to her, which means Kate cannot be resurrected if she died. He orchestrated a distraction by paying off human supremacists Homines Verendi to stage an attack on his own son. Once Kate was defenseless, Shaw emerged from below deck and ensnared Lockheed with a net gun, making him a helpless hostage. He then released Krakoan seeds at her feet, which wrapped around her and prevented her from using her powers. He then dropped her and Lockheed into the sea. While Lockheed was able to survive, Kate sank helplessly, and once her head dropped under the surface, she had no air left and drowned instantly.<ref>''Marauders'' #7</ref> Her death is later confirmed by Bishop as he retrieves Kate's body,<ref>''Marauders'' #8</ref> as it was also established that the Resurrection Protocols indeed do not apply to Kate, as the Five, for reasons unknown, cannot resurrect her.<ref>''Marauders'' #9</ref> However, she is later resurrected, as Emma Frost realized that it was due to the nature of Kate's intangibility powers that her mindless body was unable to break out of the egg.<ref>''Marauders'' #11</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
[[File:Phase powers.jpg|right|thumb|175px|Physics professor [[James Kakalios]] has attempted to use [[quantum mechanics]] to explain Kitty Pryde's "phasing" power. He has described it as an ability to control her own "macroscopic quantum [[wave function]], increasing her [[Quantum tunnelling|tunneling]] probability to near 100 percent at will."<ref name="PhysicsofSuperheroes"/>]]
Kitty is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] with the ability to pass through solid matter by passing her atomic particles through the spaces between the atoms of the object through which she is moving. In this way she and the object through which she is passing can temporarily merge without interacting, and each is unharmed when Shadowcat has finished passing through the object. This process is called "phasing" or [[quantum tunneling]] and it renders her almost completely intangible to physical touch.<ref name="PhysicsofSuperheroes" /> Shadowcat passes through objects at the same speed at which she is moving before she enters them. Since she is unable to breathe while inside an object, she can only continuously phase through solid objects (as when she travels underground) as long as she can hold her breath. However, contrary depictions of the duration of her phasing ability have been presented, such as when she has phased miles within an object. The use of her abilities also interferes with any electrical systems as she passes through by disrupting the flow of [[electron]]s from atom to atom, including the bio-electric systems of living bodies if she concentrates in the right way.<ref>''X-Men Black Sun'' #1</ref> This typically causes machines to malfunction or be destroyed as she phases through them, and can induce shock and unconsciousness in living beings.

Using her power began as an optional ability, but for a period (over ten years of published comics, approximately two years in-continuity) Kitty existed in a naturally "phased" state, and had to consciously choose to become solid. Kitty has returned to her original form and is normally solid and must choose to use her power.<ref>''X-Men True Friends'' #1 (1999)</ref>  While phasing, she does not physically walk on surfaces, but rather interacts with the molecules of air above them, allowing her to ascend and descend, causing her to seemingly walk on air. While phased, she is immune to most physical attacks, and has inconsistent showings of some resistance to [[telepathy]]. The density of some materials (such as [[adamantium]]) can prove deleterious to her phasing, causing her to be severely disoriented or experience pain if she tries to pass through them.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 1 #125</ref><ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #165</ref>  Some energy attacks also prove problematic for Kitty. For example, an energy blast fired by [[Harpoon (comics)|Harpoon]], a member of the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]], caused her to lose her ability to become fully tangible for months.{{issue|date=April 2018}} Magic and magical beings can also harm her in her phased state, as demonstrated in a battle with a [[N'Garai]] demon whose claws left no visible marks, but caused Kitty severe pain as they passed through her intangible body.{{issue|date=April 2018}}

Kitty can also extend her powers to phase other people and objects. She is able to phase at least six other people (or objects of similar mass) with her, so long as they establish and maintain physical contact with her. She can extend her phasing effect to her own clothing or any other object with mass up to that of a small truck, as long as she remains in contact with it. Kitty can also make objects intangible by maintaining contact with them. She has threatened to leave people phased into a wall,<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #210</ref> and used her power offensively to harm the Technarch [[Magus (Technarchy)|Magus]],{{issue|date=May 2013}} and Danger.{{issue|date=May 2013}}

Kitty's powers seem to have increased over the years. During an ''[[X-Treme X-Men]]'' story arc in which she is kidnapped by Reverend [[William Stryker]], she phases out of sync with Earth's rotation to move from one place in the world (only east or west) to another seemingly instantaneously.{{issue|date=May 2013}} At the climax of ''[[Astonishing X-Men]]'', Kitty phases a 10&nbsp;mi (16&nbsp;km) long "bullet" composed of super-dense alien metals through the entire planet Earth. This feat caused her considerable strain, but she is unable to phase out of the bullet.<ref>''Giant-Size Astonishing X-Men'' #2</ref> Moreover, originally Kitty found it difficult or impossible to phase only part of her body at a time.  In the [[Days of Future Past]] story arc, she is possessed by her older future self, allowing her to solidify only her shoulder while phasing the rest of her body through Destiny—a feat explicitly beyond the 13-year-old Kitty's abilities.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #142</ref>  By contrast, the Kitty Pryde of Joss Whedon's run can punch and kick someone standing on the other side of a wall, selectively phasing and unphasing body parts as necessary.{{issue|date=March 2015}}  She can even run and leap through an armed opponent, grabbing their weapon as she passes by, which presumably requires her to solidify only the surface area of the palms of her hands and then immediately phase both her palms and the weapon.{{issue|date=March 2015}}

Besides her mutant powers, Kitty is a genius in the field of applied technology and [[computer science]]. She is highly talented in the design and use of computer hardware. She is a skilled pilot of piston and jet engine aircraft, and a competent pilot of certain advanced interstellar vehicles. She has previously shown a unique ability to wield the [[Soulsword]] and also be harmed by it. Since her possession by the ninja demon Ogun, she has been consistently shown to be an excellent [[Hand to hand combat|hand-to-hand]] combatant, having since been endowed with a lifetime of training in the martial arts of Japanese ninja and samurai.

She is a professional-level [[dance]]r in both ballet and modern dance. She speaks fluent English, Japanese, Russian, and the royal and standard languages of the alien [[Shi'ar]] and [[Skrull]], and has moderate expertise in Gaelic, Hebrew, and German.

Kitty also shares a mental/empathic connection with her pet dragon [[Lockheed (comics)|Lockheed]]; both she and the alien dragon can "sense" each other's presence at times and generally understand one another's thoughts and actions.

When Kitty used the Black Vortex, her powers were augmented to a cosmic scale making her a god-like being.{{issue|date=July 2015}} She can phase through any material of any density and can even phase a planet out of Thane's amber, whereas in her normal state it is an extremely difficult task to simply phase herself out of the amber. She can also apparently transverse between the planes of the multiverse and is immune to the effects of space. Her appearance can be changed but her natural form appears to be rather gaseous in look.

==Reception==

=== Critical reception ===
Chris Arrant of ''[[Newsarama]]'' referred to Kitty Pryde as one of the "best Marvel characters of all time," writing, "The X-Men are amazing - uncanny, even - but it wasn't until Kitty Pryde entered the picture that readers gained a real perspective of how uncanny. Created as a 'girl next door'/grounded character in the original Chris Claremont/John Byrne era, Shadowcat was a hit character from the start - and she only got better over the years. The secret? Unlike many young comic book heroes, she was allowed to grow up, and all of us readers could grow up with her. Kitty Pryde is one of the few characters that have significantly grown, matured, and evolved over the years - from a fresh-faced early teens student to a full-on adult team leader today. Even while she was in her teens and early adulthood, readers met hardened versions of her such as 'Days of Future Past(opens in new tab)'s Kate Pryde and Excalibur's Widget. But she also grew up for real in such touchstone series as Kitty Pryde: Agent of SHIELD, Mechanix, and especially the current Marauders ongoing. Of all the mutant characters, Kitty Pryde has proven to be the most human when it comes to evolution and growth, And that doesn't just make it stand out among her fellow X-Men, but among the entire Marvel Comics pantheon as well."<ref name=":0"/> David Uzumeri of ''[[ComicsAlliance]]'' described Kitty Pryde as a "fan-favorite phasing mutant," stating, "She had an appropriately temporary permanent goodbye, and then she was gone, careening through the void in a ballistic dong. When you think about it, this is somewhat appropriate for a character who's largely fulfilled the role of "dream girlfriend" for the majority of X-Men writers and readers. Because for a character who purportedly acts as a role model for girls and women, she's always seemed like more of a wish-fulfillment fantasy for nerdy teenagers (and fetishistic British comic writers). Kitty was always pretty close to perfect; whatever errors she made were always well-intentioned. She's not a particularly vengeful character, and she constantly fights for the underdogs and disenfranchised, especially nerds and geeks. She's proficient with computers and usually the wittiest person in the room. She's the template Buffy Summers and Veronica Mars were based on – the cute, funny, principled girl who'd rather hang out with the misfits than the cool crowd. In short, she's always been defined by the desires and ideals of dudes. It's why her fate is a fitting metaphor for her status – careening around through the void of storytelling, trapped by the conventions and demands that her male writers and fans place on her. I've railed against the term "Mary Sue" before, but if anything justifies (or even inspired!) the term's existence, Katherine Pryde is it.The fact is, Kitty's moral perfection has become her character, since everyone loves her so much that nobody wants to drag her through any mud. Because she almost never makes mistakes, she can't really progress as a character by learning from them – she's a patron saint."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Uzumeri |first=David UzumeriDavid |title=The Return of Kitty Pryde: Everybody's Girlfriend |url=https://comicsalliance.com/the-return-of-kitty-pryde-girlfriend/ |access-date=2022-09-10 |website=ComicsAlliance |language=en}}</ref> Eric Diaz of ''[[Nerdist]]'' called Kitty Pryde "smart and resourceful," saying, "The character of Kitty was introduced in 1980, in the middle of the legendary run from creators Chris Claremont and John Byrne on Uncanny X-Men. The 14 year old mutant, who could phase through solid objects, was the youngest member of the team and the wish fulfillment character for millions of kids who read X-Men comics. Fans got to see Kitty grow up to become a competent and capable leader over the years. For non-comics fans, she was maybe best known for being part of the X-Men arcade game from the early ’90s, which was based on the animated pilot Pryde of the X-Men.But Katherine Pryde, despite her popularity, has never had much in the way of solo stories to base a movie on."<ref>{{Cite web |title=5 KITTY PRYDE Stories That Could Inspire Her Solo Film |url=https://nerdist.com/article/5-kitty-pryde-stories-solo-film-tim-miller/ |access-date=2022-09-10 |website=Nerdist |language=en-US}}</ref> Kat Vendetti of ''[[ComicsVerse]]'' called Kitty Pryde a "protector and a hero," asserting, "There’s a lot to look forward to with the X-Men’s upcoming renaissance, with a slew of team and solo titles giving the X-Men their much-anticipated comeback. But what has us most excited is seeing Kitty Pryde take the lead in X-Men Gold. Now that she’s back from leading the Guardians of the Galaxy as Star-Lord, Kitty Pryde will be in charge of much of the same team from ExtraordinaryX-Men, as well as making up a group reminiscent of her former Excalibur team. Kitty is no stranger to leadership roles. We saw her take on an Xavier-esque role when the time-displaced original five X-Men made their debut in All-New X-Men. She also had a commanding presence in the mid-2000s during Joss Whedon and John Cassaday’s run of Astonishing X-Men, where she frequently went toe-to-toe with teammate and former adversary Emma Frost. Even in alternate timelines, Kitty has taken on leadership roles, such as in X-Men: The End and “Days of Future Past.” Throughout her history, Kitty Pryde’s characterization has been both intricate and multifaceted. She has used her strength and wit to save the X-Men, but she also embraces her emotions to stand up for what she wants. She can save the day when others can’t, and she’s also not afraid to express her more vulnerable sides. Through it all, Kitty Pryde never shies away from representing everything she stands for. From the moment we met her and as we continue to know her, Kitty has proven time and again to be a natural and worthy leader. Kitty Pryde remains the best choice to lead the team in X-Men Gold; she has everything it takes to be the best leader the X-Men have ever had."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Vendetti |first=Kat |date=April 3, 2017 |title=7 Moments That Prove Kitty Pryde Will Be the Best Leader the X-Men Ever Had |url=https://comicsverse.com/kitty-pryde-best-leader-x-men/ |website=[[ComicsVerse]]}}</ref>

Jonathan Thompson of ''[[CBR.com]]'' referred to Kitty Pryde as the "heart and soul of the X-Men," stating, "Ever since she first appeared in 1980’s ''Uncanny X-Men'' #129, Kitty Pryde has been a symbol of female empowerment for fans. She may have seemed like just another teenage mutant who can phase through solid matter, but she was not to be underestimated. When she first met the X-Men, she saved them from the White Queen. When she came to join the team in issue #138, she brought with her a fresh start for readers on the heels of the tragic end of “The Dark Phoenix Saga.” Today, she is the X-Men’s team leader. Over the last 38 years, Kitty has continued to inspire us and allow us to grow with her. Yet, despite this long history in the comics, many people may not know Kitty as well as they think they do. How can she send someone’s consciousness back in time in ''X-Men: Days of Future Past''? How powerful is she? Does she have a romantic past with Colossus in the films? Is that story about the origin of her name true? If you got your X-Men education from the films rather than the comics, there is a lot worth learning about Kitty that makes her a fuller character on the screen. Alternatively, if you have followed Kitty for years through the source material, you may have some questions (or critiques) regarding the live-action version. And then, of course, there is the world of animation which reinterpreted Kitty in a few different ways. No matter what your preferred medium is, there is undoubtedly something more to learn about her. Here are 20 facts about Kitty that every fan should know."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Thompson |first=Jonathan |date=2018-08-21 |title=Pryde Of The X-Men: 20 Facts Only True Marvel Fans Know About Kitty Pryde |url=https://www.cbr.com/x-men-kitty-pryde-things-to-know/ |access-date=2022-09-10 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref> Nick Abadzis of ''[[Tor.com]]'' wrote, "Kitty led a long line of mutant teenagers who, in turn, represent the disaffected and disenchanted, the rebellious and the geeky. But Kitty was the first and somehow remains the archetype. Her powers initially seemed a secondary element in the appeal of the character, whose intelligence and Jewish ancestry were highlighted. Yet Kitty’s ability to “phase” was, to a degree, an ingenious metaphor for that teenage desire to sometimes just disappear. Who, at that age, hasn’t sometimes felt dumb and socially awkward enough to want the world to just swallow them up? Kitty could do it—and it was so cool. She could (and still can) also lower her density to such a degree that she can literally walk on air, up away and out of trouble—another way of escaping unwanted attention or social embarrassment. With her precocious academic gifts, she should’ve automatically been a bratty, audience-alienating boffin (see: Wesley Crusher). Yet, in spite of these, Kitty represented the intelligent everyman probably more than any other Marvel character since Peter Parker, whose rooted, everyday humanity she echoes. In her love of comic books and computer science, she ushered in the era of the cool geek, the knowing nerd. Like Parker, her intelligence doesn’t occlude the charm her creators managed to endow her with. And, in making her so likeable, Claremont and artist John Byrne raised the level of the game. Claremont was already heading somewhere new but now they permanently shifted the focus of storytelling from straightforward superhero derring-do to a world seen through the prism of this child’s emotions; a kid with emergent superpowers. It was brilliant, adolescent soap opera about the confusion of change: Kitty provided an emotional conduit for the reader to experience what it might be like to become a mutant, an X-Man, her training and power of phasing embodying that confusion. Outside the X-Men the reader, through Kitty, caught further glimpses of what it might be like to be a mutant—or, crucially, a member of any minority group—which, in turn, helped elevate the comic book from simple monthly melodrama into an ongoing saga and pop cultural phenomenon."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Abadzis |first=Nick |date=2011-01-25 |title=The Disappearing Girl: Why I Love Kitty Pryde |url=https://www.tor.com/2011/01/25/the-disappearing-girl-why-i-love-kitty-pryde/ |access-date=2022-09-10 |website=Tor.com |language=en-US}}</ref> Thomas Bacon of ''[[Screen Rant]]'' asserted, "Nobody could have predicted just how influential Kitty Pryde would be. In a recent Twitter thread, ''The Claremont Run'' noted Kitty became Claremont's favorite "viewpoint character," the lens through which readers experienced the X-Men. It was a smart move because Claremont was indulging in increasingly adult themes. Kitty made her debut in the middle of the ''Dark Phoenix Saga'' - and her youthful perspective heightened the narrative impact. But Claremont was quick to ensure readers that Kitty was a capable and competent new addition. ''Days of Future Past'' shows she was the one member of the X-Men able to survive in a dystopian future, while another issue saw her stalked by a N'Garai demon in an issue that, appropriately enough, seemed evocative of the movie ''Alien''. Kitty was the perfect POV character, drawing new readers into the X-Men's world, adding a touch of levity and humanity to some of the darkest superhero stories. An entire generation of comic book readers fell in love with Kitty Pryde - literally. [[Brian Michael Bendis|Brian Bendis]] openly admits she was his comic book crush, which explains why Kitty wound up dating Peter Parker in his ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' relaunch. Warren Ellis infamously aged her up so she could have a relationship with the mutant Pete Wisdom, who was basically Ellis' own analog in the Marvel Comics Universe. But her greatest impact was through Joss Whedon, who recalled that famous issue of a teenager who was capable enough to take down a demon when he was creating ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer''. In fact, Whedon has gone so far as to refer to Kitty as the mother of Buffy, the main inspiration for the Slayer."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Bacon |first=Thomas |date=2021-06-06 |title=Kitty Pryde Changed X-Men Comics (And Pop Culture) Forever |url=https://screenrant.com/x-men-kitty-kate-pryde-changed-pop-culture/ |access-date=2022-09-10 |website=ScreenRant |language=en-US}}</ref> Hilary Goldstein and Richard George of ''[[IGN]]'' stated, "Most mutants come to Xavier's having experienced great trauma and difficulty in their youth. Kitty arrived as an innocent with the seemingly innocuous power to turn intangible. She is the mutant everyman, the common girl turned superhero. Marvel has attempted to replicate Kitty Pryde on several occasions, most notably with Jubilee, but there's something special about Kitty that puts her above the rest. She's strong-willed, creative and fiercely loyal. Just as her pet dragon, Lockheed, became instantly attached to Kitty, we were hooked early on. Who could have guessed long ago that she would become one of the most endearing characters in the X-Men Universe?"<ref>{{Cite web |date=2011-07-13 |title=The Top 25 X-Men - Comics Feature at IGN |url=http://uk.comics.ign.com/articles/708/708826p5.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713004756/http://uk.comics.ign.com/articles/708/708826p5.html |archive-date=2011-07-13  |access-date=2022-09-10 }}</ref>

==== ''Star-Lord and Kitty Pryde'' ====
According to [[Diamond Comic Distributors]], ''Star-Lord and Kitty Pryde'' #1 was the 39th best selling comic book in July 2015.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Top 100 Comics: July 2015 |url=http://www.diamondcomics.com/Article/167109-Top-100-Comics-July-2015 |access-date=2022-09-10 |website=www.diamondcomics.com |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Comichron: July 2015 Comic Book Sales to Comics Shops |url=https://www.comichron.com/monthlycomicssales/2015/2015-07.html |access-date=2022-09-10 |website=www.comichron.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Top 300 Comics Actual--July 2015 |url=https://icv2.com/articles/news/view/32269/top-300-comics-actual-july-2015 |access-date=2022-09-10 |website=icv2.com |language=en}}</ref>

Brian Delpozo of ''[[ComicsVerse]]'' stated, "''Star-Lord and Kitty Pryde'' #1 is one of the best issues to come out of Marvel’s “Secret Wars” storyline so far. While it’s plot is a bit exposition heavy at the start, it eventually starts moving at a brisk pace, with very strong characters and fun art. If the darkness of most of Battleworld is bringing you down, I’d definitely recommend giving this issue a read."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Delpozo |first=Brian |date=July 28, 2015 |title=STAR-LORD AND KITTY PRYDE #1: A Whole New World… |url=https://comicsverse.com/star-lord-kitty-pryde-1-whole-new-world/ |website=[[ComicsVerse]]}}</ref> Levi Hunt of ''[[IGN]]'' gave ''Star-Lord and Kitty Pryde'' #1 a grade of 8.8 out of 10, writing, "Star-Lord and Kitty Pryde is a Disney movie of a comic -- and that’s not just because Peter Quill spends half the issue singing Little Mermaid songs. Peter is one of the only survivors of the 616-Marvel Universe still alive and now he is hiding out among God Doom’s people, just trying not to get caught. Suddenly his life changes when he meets an alternate-reality version of his fiancé – Kitty Pryde. This book has all the hijinks, humor, and heart of Tangled or Aladdin, and that’s just where the Disney comparisons start. Alti Firmansyah draws this book with all of expressive, big-eyed, joy of Disney minimalism. It perfectly complements Sam Humphries’s wonderful story and makes for an enjoyable read for (almost) all ages."<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Yehl |first1=Joshua |last2=Hunt |first2=Levi |date=2015-07-23 |title=Comic Book Reviews for July 22, 2015 |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/23/comic-book-reviews-for-july-22-2015 |access-date=2022-09-10 |website=IGN |language=en}}</ref>

==Other versions==
{{Main|Alternative versions of Kitty Pryde}}
In addition to her [[Marvel Universe|mainstream]] incarnation, Kitty Pryde has been depicted in other [[fictional universe]]s.

===Age of Apocalypse===
[[File:XMEN-ShadowcatAoA.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Shadowcat in ''Generation Next'' #1]]
In the [[Age of Apocalypse]] reality, Kitty grows up under harsh circumstances and her nature reflects it. She has short hair, tight clothes, and [[chain smoking|chain smokes]] cigarettes. Her parents are killed in the [[Chicago]] Cullings, and she is forcibly recruited into [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]'s army, but is later rescued by [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]]. [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] puts Shadowcat under [[Wolverine (character)|Weapon X]]'s training, hoping to turn her into the [[X-Men]]'s assassin, and she is given a set of retractable artificial claws around each wrist to better imitate her teacher's fighting style. After the fallout between Colossus and Magneto, Shadowcat sides with Colossus, whom she has married. Instead of leaving the fight against Apocalypse altogether, the couple become the teachers of Generation Next. The two submit their trainees to harsh situations, giving them little comfort despite the fact that Shadowcat is close to the age of her students.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

Shadowcat assists the team in rescuing [[Illyana Rasputin]] from the Seattle Core, and, at Colossus' behest, abandons her students after Illyana is saved. She is killed by Colossus in his ruthless obsession to protect his sister, [[Magik (Illyana Rasputin)|Illyana]]; coming between an enraged Colossus and his endangered sister, Shadowcat never believed he would harm her.<ref>''X-Men: Omega''</ref>

===Days of Future Past===
In the ''[[Days of Future Past]]'' timeline ([[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|Earth-811]]), Shadowcat goes by the name Kate Pryde. Kate attempts to go back in time to prevent the assassination of Senator Robert Kelly by [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] and the [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]].<ref name="Uncanny X-Men #141-142"/> She succeeds, only to create a separate timeline where the events of her past still come to pass.{{issue|date=October 2020}} After returning to her own time Kate helps [[Rachel Summers]] escape back to the timeline she just created.{{issue|date=October 2020}} Captured by [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]], Kate escapes by phasing through her inhibitor collar and fell into a time warp, causing her to merge with the Sentinel that was scanning her, and arrives in the timeline Rachel is inhabiting.<ref name="Exc67">''Excalibur'' Vol.1 #67</ref> Kate's mind settles in a small, metal, off-spherical body and becomes known as '''Widget'''.<ref>''Excalibur'' Vol.1 #1</ref> After a few adventures in that timeline, mostly in company with her Earth-616 counterpart's team [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]], Kate regains her memory and returns to her original timeline where she is able to reprogram the ruling Sentinels to protect life, ending their tyranny.<ref name="Exc67" />

===Earth X===
In ''[[Earth X]]'' it is revealed in the appendix of issue six that Kitty Pryde is killed saving Colossus while he could not shift into his metal form.  Instead of phasing the bullet through her, she heroically takes the bullet and is killed.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

===Exiles===
[[File:Pryde in Exiles.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Cat, after "[[Onychectomy|declawing]]" an alternative [[Alternative versions of Wolverine#Exiles and Weapon X|James Howlett.]] Art by [[Michael Golden (comics)|Michael Golden]].]]
A version of Kitty Pryde codenamed '''Cat''' first appeared in ''[[Exiles (comic book)|Exiles]]'' #96. She is younger than her [[Earth-616]] counterpart. She has the appearance and powers of the normal Shadowcat although she wears a different costume. Prior to her joining the Exiles, this version of Kitty had been recruited by [[Emma Frost]] as one of the core agents of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]]'s strike force.<ref>''New Exiles'' #12</ref> She helps Psylocke defeat Doom's soldiers who have invaded the Panoptichron.<ref>''Exiles'' #98</ref> She helps retrieve [[Blink (comics)|Blink]], [[Morph (comics)|Morph]], and [[Sabretooth (comics)#Age of Apocalypse and the Exiles|Sabretooth]] from being scattered across the multiverse.<ref>''Exiles'' #99</ref> She works as a computer expert for the team and is a full member of the Exiles.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

Cat's skill with using her powers means she is not tied to any dimension and can see through various realities, including those of the mind (for instance seeing the various personalities in [[Sage (comics)|Sage's]] mind as "ghosts" surrounding her). Her arrival in the Crystal Palace and connection to its computers has increased this, giving her the ability to "cascade" through different alternative versions of herself, altering her appearance and details of her powers.<ref>''New Exiles'' #13</ref> Amongst other versions, she has assumed the form of a Kitty Pryde with the appearance and powers of [[Tigra]].<ref>''New Exiles'' #14</ref> During the New Exiles' last mission Cat faced off against Madame Hydra (Sue Storm) and killed her at the cost of her own life.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

There has been another version of Kitty that appeared in the King [[Hyperion (comics)#Exiles|Hyperion]] story arc (''Exiles'' #38-40). She had survived an attack on the X-Mansion by the Sentinels. The Colossus from her universe had been killed in the attack but she had the same feelings towards Weapon X's Colossus even though he was not her Colossus. The two eventually fell in love with each other. Unfortunately this did not last since she died with Colossus when they were shot into the empty vacuum of space by Hyperion.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

===House of M===
When the [[Scarlet Witch]] altered reality in the 616 Universe, creating the reality known as [[House of M]] where mutants were the dominant population, Kitty Pryde was a teacher in a public middle school in Cincinnati, Ohio.<ref>''House Of M'' #1</ref> Like many of the heroes of Earth 616, she is reminded of the true reality by [[Layla Miller]] and recruited in the fight to restore reality.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

===Magik===
In the [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''[[Magik (Illyana and Storm)]]'', an alternative reality Kitty renames herself "Cat" after she is mutated by the demonic sorcerer [[Belasco (comics)|Belasco]] into a more [[felidae|feline]] form, with cat eyes, whiskers, a tail, and enhanced physical abilities and senses.  Trapped in Belasco's [[Otherplace|Limbo]], Cat takes a militant view towards defeating the sorcerer, eschewing the magic that her reality's Storm embraces, instead turning to skills in swordplay and physical combat. She tries to save the Illyana Rasputin of Earth-616 from corruption through magic by taking Illyana into the wilderness of Limbo and teaching the child to fight and survive. Like the Kitty Pryde of Earth-616 eventually would, Cat became Illyana's best friend, but more in the role of an older sister due to the difference in their ages.<ref>''Magik'' #1 & #2</ref>

Cat's plan goes awry when the pair's attempt to confront Belasco fails, at the cost of the life of an enslaved [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]]; Illyana falls under Belasco's influence and Cat is further transformed towards a feline, with a semi-animalistic mind completely loyal to Belasco.<ref>''Magik'' #2</ref> Cat is eventually slain by Illyana when Belasco sets Cat upon his rebellious apprentice; facing death at Cat's hands and knowing that, deep down, a part of Kitty still exists and hates her enslavement, Illyana broke Cat's neck in self-defense.<ref>''Magik'' #3</ref>

Long after Illyana overthrows Belasco, escapes Limbo, and becomes a member of the junior X-Men team known as the [[New Mutants]], Cat's remains are found by the team in Limbo's throne room. By then she had completely decomposed to a skeleton. Illyana, facing a rebellion of Limbo's demon population that threatened to overrun Earth, smashed Cat's skull in rage over the demonic taint that Belasco left on her soul and frustration over the horrible choice she had to make to kill Cat.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

===Marvel Zombies===
Kitty is briefly shown in the background as a zombie in ''Ultimate Fantastic Four'' #23, despite her mutant phasing powers. She is also seen in ''Marvel Zombies: Dead Days'', when zombie Alpha Flight attack the X-Men. This would appear to have been retconned, though, as of ''Marvel Zombies: Halloween,'' which depicts her and her son Peter with [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] surviving for several years in an out of the way house farm, encountering zombies, but, fortunately, being rescued by [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], who dispatched the remaining zombies.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

The Earth-91126/Earth-Z Kitty is recruited by [[Alternative versions of Spider-Man#Marvel Zombies Spider-Man (Earth-2149)|Earth-2149/Marvel Zombies Spider-Man]] to help him develop a cure for the zombie hunger, on the grounds that her powers mean that she would be in no danger from him if he should succumb to his zombie instincts,<ref>''Marvel Zombies Return'' #2</ref> but she is later seemingly killed when the zombie [[Quasar (Wendell Vaughn)|Quasar]] holds her underwater until she is forced to become solid once more, allowing the infected [[Namor]] to eat her flesh (much to the rage of the zombie Wolverine, of Earth-2149).{{issue|date=February 2013}}

===Mutant X===
Storm was taken by the vampire Dracula and unlike Earth 616, she does not return. Kitty goes off to battle her, either to save or kill her. Kitty slays several vampires in the way but Storm proves too much for her and Kitty becomes her unwilling slave for some time. She later shows up as the Black Queen of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] and seems to be none too happy with Storm.  It's also hinted that she was engaged or going to be engaged to Colossus.  Her ultimate fate at the end of the series is unknown.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

===Lightning Force===
In the reality of Earth-597, an alternative universe where [[World War II]] was won by [[Nazism|Nazi]] Germany, Kitty is forced to serve as Shadowcat alongside Nightcrawler, Meggan, and [[Hauptmann Englande]] as a member of the Lightning Force (a version of Excalibur), made a virtual slave because of her Jewish heritage. She leads a sad existence and is easily identified by her shaved head and the Star of David tattooed on her forehead. It is indicated, from her own statements and those made by her reality's counterpart of [[Moira MacTaggert]], that this Shadowcat is a true ghost, raised from the dead by a combination of science and magic and bound to serve the Nazi regime. This Shadowcat had the added ability to disrupt life force with her phasing power, knocking her victims unconscious, much like how her counterpart in the "prime" Marvel Universe ([[Earth-616]]) can disrupt technology that she phases through. She is also able to alter her facial features to a "demonic" aspect when attacking enemies or else responding to aggressive, commanding behavior from her superiors.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

===Pirate Kitty===
Kitty tells Illyana a bedtime story and casts herself as Pirate Kitty Pryde, captain of the ''Abdul Alhazred'', who operated in a magical world. Unlike her mainstream counterpart, she did not have any mutant powers and wore a classic pirate outfit which also included her [[Star of David]] necklace. She was also sometimes known as Colleen. Kitty was good friends of her version of [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], the [[Bamf]]s ([[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]]), Windrider ([[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]]), the "Fiend-with-no-name" (later revealed to be named "Mean") ([[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]) and Lockheed (an alternative version of the [[Blackbird (comics)|X-Jet]]). Kitty also helped her versions of [[Professor X]] and [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] capture and cure that universe's version of [[Dark Phoenix]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #153 (January 1982)</ref>

At first she was only a fairy tale character, but later it is revealed that her fairy tale is actually an alternative universe. (In fact, several members of this universe, the [[Nightcrawler (comics)#Bamf|Bamfs]], would later come to [[Earth-616]] to cause trouble.) When Earth-616's Nightcrawler was temporarily stranded in her world, Kitty helped him defeat the sorcerer Shagreen and also encountered the Earth-616 versions of Illyana, Lockheed, and herself.<ref>''Nightcrawler'' (miniseries) #3-4 (January and February 1986)</ref>

===Professor W's X-Men===
In the native universe of the Exiles member Nocturne, Kitty is a senior member of the X-Men led by Nightcrawler. She is a teacher and TJ refers to her as "Aunt Kate". During a fight with Apocalypse Kitty gets exposed to a machine that reverts her to a younger stage of her life when she had only been with the X-Men a few weeks. Nocturne helps Kitty fit into the school and becomes her best friend. She also proves useful in the fight against the Brotherhood led by Cyclops.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

===Ruins===
Imprisoned alongside other mutants at a prison camp in Texas by President X, Kitty attempted to use her phasing powers to escape, only to get stuck halfway through her cell door, losing three feet of intestines in the process.<ref>{{cite book |title=Ruins #2 |date=1995 |publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref>

===Secret Wars (2015)===
During the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline, a version of Kitty named Kitten resides in the ''[[wuxia]]''-inspired [[K'un-L'un]] region of [[Battleworld]]. In this reality, Kitten is a martial artist who joins [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]]'s band of outcasts after being expelled from her school for attempting a forbidden technique, a side effect of which left her intangible. Kitten and her fellow outcasts became pupils of [[Shang-Chi]], the exiled son of Emperor [[Zheng Zu]].  Dubbing their new school ''The Lowest Caste'', Shang-Chi represents the group as their master for the tournament deciding the next Emperor of K'un-L'un, hoping to usurp his father's tyrannical rule. Kitten accompanies Shang-Chi for each of his fights in the Thirteen Chambers.  During his final fight with Zu, Shang-Chi uses Kitten's technique of intangibility, which leads to his eventual victory and replaces his father as the new Emperor of K'un-L'un.<ref>''Master of Kung Fu'' (vol. 2) #1-4 (2015)</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===  <!-- This section is linked from [[Rogue (comics)]] -->
[[File:Ultimate Kitty Pryde.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Ultimate Kitty Pryde, with the costume designed by [[Stuart Immonen]] in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' comic book.]]
The [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate]] version of Shadowcat (Kitty Pryde) first appears as a 14-year-old girl in ''[[Ultimate X-Men]]'' #21. She is also Jewish and wears the Star of David around her neck, but does not appear to possess the same genius IQ as her mainstream (Earth-616) counterpart.<ref>''Official Handbook of the Ultimate Marvel Universe'' #2</ref><ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #115</ref>

Kitty's mother, worried about Kitty's mutation, seeks help from [[Professor X#Ultimate Charles Xavier|Professor Charles Xavier]]. Kitty becomes a student at Xavier's school, when her mother allows her to attend under the condition she does not take part in any X-Men missions, nor train in any "Danger Room" simulations. Kitty soon rebels against this and joins the X-Men as their youngest member. She idolizes [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Spider-Man]] and has a crush on him; she even dates Peter Parker for a time. After a fierce argument with Professor Xavier concerning Peter's secret identity, which his [[Aunt May]] had just found out about, Kitty leaves the X-Men and enrolls in Peter's school. Their relationship is strained after their romantic involvement (as superheroes) becomes publicly known, making it impossible for them to date anymore in their civilian identities, and eventually comes to an end when Peter realizes he cannot get over his feelings for [[Mary Jane Watson|Mary Jane]]. However, Kitty still retains strong feelings for him.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

Following the disastrous flood triggered by Magneto and the subsequent ban of public use of mutant powers, Kitty assumes the identity of the [[Shroud (comics)|Shroud]].<ref>''Ultimate Comics Spider-Man'' #6</ref> Kitty also discovers that she can also decrease the space between her atoms make herself super-dense, giving her both superhuman strength and durability. When the authorities see Kitty as a threat, she enters into a fierce rage and demonstrates these powers for the first time to her friends. She is strong and angry enough to punch Spider-Man several feet through the air.<ref>''Ultimate Comics Spider-Man #10''</ref> She eventually escapes and goes into hiding in the now abandoned Morlock Tunnel with Iceman and the Human Torch after Peter Parker's death.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

Kitty makes an appearance in ''[[Ultimate Comics: X]]'', locating Jimmy Hudson, who is revealed to be [[Ultimate Wolverine|Wolverine]]'s son. Kitty was charged by Logan before his death to locate Jimmy and reveal his true origins to him.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

After the death of Spider-Man she formed new team of X-Men consisting of herself, Iceman and the [[Human Torch]]. They soon rescued the mutant Rogue from the mutant-hunting Nimrod robots, going on to recruit Jimmy Hudson into their group as well. After killing the mutant-hunting William Stryker, Kitty decided to leave New York for the Southwest along with Bobby, Rogue, and Jimmy (leaving only Johnny behind) in order to save the mutants there and defeat the Nimrods, now controlled by the deceased Stryker's consciousness.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

===Spider-Gwen===
In the reality where Gwen Stacy is Spider-Woman, Kitty is an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Black Ops department, where she works closely with Wolverine to keep him in check and to help him fight his immortal curse. Like the Age of Apocalypse version, she also wields artificial claws on her wrists. It's revealed that she works with Logan out of guilt, as Stryker forced her to use her powers to subject Logan to the Weapon X experiment.<ref>Spider-Gwen Vol 2. #20-22 (2017)</ref>

===What If===
* In ''What if Phoenix Had Not Died'', Kitty is obliterated by Dark Phoenix before she destroyed the Earth.<ref>''What If..?'' Vol. 1 #27.</ref>
* In ''What If the X-Men had Lost Inferno?'', Kitty is one of the last eight remaining superheroes on the planet.

She then solidified her hand killing Wolverine instantly although she lost her hand in the process.{{issue|date=February 2013}}
* In ''What if Magneto and Professor X Had Formed The X-Men Together'', Kitty is the tech guru at the Good Shepard clinic (That reality's version of the X-Mansion). She is very similar to her mainstream counterpart. But unlike the mainstream version this Kitty Pryde would wear different coloured wigs and cut her natural hair short.

She was also friends with Lockheed although she only called him Dragon.{{issue|date=February 2013}}
* In ''What if Astonishing X-Men'', Kitty is amongst the X-Men who fight a Phoenix powered Emma Frost.

===X-Babies===
An X-Baby version of Shadowcat appears briefly in the [[X-Babies]] one-shot comic. She is wearing her original costume and is younger than the other X-Babies. She is named as Shadowkitty rather than Shadowcat or Kitty Pryde. She also doesn't seem to have a strong bond with the X-Baby version of [[Lockheed (comics)|Lockheed]].{{issue|date=February 2013}}

===X-Men Forever===
In the ''X-Men Forever'' series, Kitty and Nightcrawler have left Excalibur and rejoined the X-Men after the events of X-Men #1-3. Of the X-Men, she undergoes the most drastic changes from the events of ''X-Men Forever'' #1.<ref>This is excepting Storm, with her setup to betrayal apparently predating the issue</ref> During the battle with Fabian Cortez, she phases through Wolverine while he is being affected by Cortez's power. This drives her powers haywire as well, and somehow she ends up with one of Wolverine's claws in her wrist. Claremont has also hinted in dialogue throughout the title so far that she may have also undergone psychological or psychic changes as a result of the event. From ''Forever'' #4 to the current issue, she is shown to be able to use the claw in the exact method Wolverine would manifest it, with no apparent ill effects (the mechanism for this has not yet been made clear) outside of excruciating pain. Because of the merger with Logan's DNA she has begun to develop a healing factor, slower than Wolverine's but it heals faster when she is intangible. She has also slightly enhanced senses, she also can produce a set of five retractable claws on her left hand like Sabretooth. She has also begun to take on Logan's personality and memories as well. And because of this she is beginning to wonder what part of her truly remains the same.<ref>''X-Men Forever'' #4</ref>

===X-Men: Misfits===
In the ''[[X-Men: Misfits]]'' original English language manga one-shot graphic novel from Marvel and DelRay, Kitty is the newest and only female student of the all-male Xavier School for Gifted Youngsters, which is now experimenting with having a co-ed student body. As the sole girl, she becomes the center of attention and attraction for the rest of the students.  She becomes a member and the mascot of the elitist fraternity, The Hellfire Club, and has a short-lived romantic relationship with the school troublemaker Pyro.{{issue|date=September 2009}}

===X-Men: The End===
In the ''[[X-Men: The End]]'' future, Kitty Pryde becomes the mayor of Chicago and then President of the United States. She has three children: her eldest daughter, named Meredith, and twins 10 years younger than Meredith, Sara and Doug, with an unnamed partner who died protecting her from an assassination attempt.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

===Miscellaneous===
* In ''[[Excalibur (comic book)|Excalibur]]'' #103, we see many alternative versions of Shadowcat. Many of these variations have appeared in other comics, such as [[Age of Apocalypse]], but there were other variations, including one of her as a [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]] convert, a sex [[dominatrix]], a homeless person, a nun, a version wearing a costume similar to [[Phantom Girl]], and a normal person who owns an [[The Old Curiosity Shop|Olde Curiosity Shoppe]].
* In ''[[New Mutants]]'' #63 Illyana (Magik), along with Lockheed, gets trapped on an alien spaceship that has been invaded by a [[Brood (comics)|Brood]] Queen. On this ship the Brood Queen created clones of the X-Men, including Kitty. This one had the Ariel suit on, but it was green, instead of the typical blue. These X-Men are implanted with Brood eggs. Her memories were altered by the Brood Queen like the other X-Men, but eventually they rebel against her and are free. Illyana uses the soulsword to eliminate the Brood Eggs from their bodies. The X-Men stay on the ship; whether they are still on it is unknown.
*During the Cross Time Caper storyline a few different appearances of Kitty appear. One was a princess who was gifted with magic abilities. She eventually married a short dashing prince (who had originally fallen in love with the mainstream version of Kitty). A second version was a crime boss who was betrayed and killed by her partner in crime Illiyana Rasputin. A third was from a world of sentient dinosaurs. She went by the name of Shadowcompsognathus.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

* Kitty Pryde appeared as Sprite in "The X-Men Adventure" episode of ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends (1981 TV series)|Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]'', which guest-starred the X-Men.<ref>{{Cite episode |series="Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends" |title=The X-Men Adventure (TV Episode 1983) |website=IMDb |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0706822/fullcredits |access-date=April 8, 2021}}</ref> She was voiced by Melissa Sue Anderson. She also appeared in her short-lived "Ariel" costume in the X-Men group cameo at the end of the episode "The Education of a Superhero".
* Kitty Pryde (voiced by [[Kath Soucie]]<ref>{{Cite web |title=Pryde of the X-Men |website=IMDb |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098137/ |language=en |access-date=April 8, 2021}}</ref>) was a viewpoint character in the [[animation|animated]] television one-shot ''[[X-Men: Pryde of the X-Men|Pryde of the X-Men]]'', as the newest member of the team. She is a new recruit of the team and is initially frightened of Nightcrawler, due to his demonic appearance. She and Nightcrawler later succeed in defeating Magneto. Once Nightcrawler seemingly dies as a result of having apparently sacrificed himself, Kitty begins to cry until discovering that he is alive and is met with positive relations by her teammates, except Wolverine. As the pilot was a failure, and the character had lost prominence in comics at the time, she was not used in the next ''[[X-Men: The Animated Series|X-Men]]'' TV series, not even in cameos. [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]] replaced her as the young viewpoint character, and in the adaptations of stories that involved her.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cbr.com/x-men-animated-series-kitty-pryde-absence-explained/|title= X-Men: The Animated Series – Where the Heck Was Kitty Pryde?|author= G.

* In the animated series ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'', Shadowcat is a main character, who is shown as the [[teenybopper]] of the team and who has a romantic interest in Brotherhood member [[Avalanche (comics)|Lance Alvers]].<ref name="cbr" /> Shadowcat saves Wolverine in the season one episode "Grim Reminder", where she unintentionally stows away with Nightcrawler while on the Blackbird without the knowledge that he was beginning to pilot the jet. She is also shown to have developed a close friendship with Nightcrawler, despite the fact that she at first displayed a dislike for his appearance. Besides Nightcrawler, she is shown to have formed a friendship with Rogue and Spyke. Her initial dislike of his appearance changes after he is severely wounded by [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], while she and the rest of the X-Men tried to recruit her. In this series, she does not have [[Lockheed (comics)|Lockheed]] for a pet, but she is shown preferring to sleep with a stuffed dragon instead of a teddy bear. Though she has an on-and-off interest in the delinquent mutant boy [[Avalanche (comics)|Lance Alvers]], early in the series she displays interest in [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]]. After Rogue is recruited, she serves as her support in beginning a romantic relationship with Scott and develops a friendship with her, despite their differences. When [[Avalanche (comics)|Avalanche]] tries to join the X-Men in the season two episode "Joyride", she tries to help him and shows additional attraction to him as she grades him and the other members of the junior team. After he informs her that some members of the group have started a joyride on the Blackbird and helps her avert catastrophe, she staunchly defends him once he is accused by Cyclops of being responsible. When Avalanche starts to leave, Shadowcat gives him a brief kiss before his departure. Their relationship continues with the two of them going to a school dance, talking on the phone and going to the mall. Despite being with the Brotherhood, Avalanche tries to protect Kitty in the fight against the Scarlet Witch. In season 3, Kitty and Lance's relationship briefly ends after the Brotherhood and Mystique blow up the X Mansion and are in part responsible for the exposure of mutants. Kitty calls Lance a "hood" after he attacks the high school and he says "he will never be good enough for her". Both look sad at these comments. In the fourth season, the X-Men try to use her powers to damage one of [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]'s domes and fails, instead being electrocuted briefly. In the fiftieth episode of the series, entitled "Ghost of a Chance", she comes across [[Danielle Moonstar]] once she depicts herself in a dream sequence to her. Once she wakes out of it, she tries to and successfully finds her, becoming friends with the girl after learning she had been in suspended animation for two years. Prior to this, it is discovered that her fear is phasing repeatedly into the ground and going further without any control of where she is going. Shadowcat plays a key role in the defeat of Apocalypse and asks the Brotherhood for help. They come to her aid; as Lance and Kitty resume their romantic relationship. Of the six main X-Men from the first season of the series, she is one of the four that is still a member of the team in the future Charles Xavier saw while in the mind of Apocalypse. Shadowcat was voiced by [[Maggie Blue O'Hara]].
* Shadowcat appears in ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]'',{{vague|date=November 2011}}<!--which episodes?--> voiced by Danielle Judovits and was a student at the Xavier Institute before the destruction of the X-Mansion and disappearance of Professor X.<ref name="cbr" /> When Wolverine reformed the X-Men to take down the Mutant Response Division and save the dismal future controlled by the Sentinels, Kitty was on her way to the "mutant paradise" [[Genosha]]. The X-Men came to re-recruit her and she immediately rejoined the team. Shadowcat appears as the youngest member of the team and she seems to have a crush on [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] as she is jealous when his attention is taken by Emma Frost<ref>''Wolverine e os X-Men (Wolverine and the X-Men)'' Eps. 3, 4 - "Hindsight Pt. III, Overflow"</ref> and is shown with a love-struck face when she lands on Bobby during a Danger Room training session, though she quickly moves away from him when [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]] arrives. She seems to have formed a friendship with Tildie Soames after babysitting her in one episode. In the last episode of the series, she uses her powers to penetrate a Sentinel controlled by Magneto, of which Beast had difficulty with. Her design is inspired by the appearance of the character in the Astonishing X-Men comics, and her costume emulates the design with the appearance of the blue and yellow used on her costume. The shorts she wears are based on the appearances of the original X-Men, and her first appearance when she wore a variant of the uniform.
* Shadowcat appears in ''[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]'' episode "And Lo...A Pilot Shall Come".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1505724/ |title=And Lo... A Pilot Shall Come! |website=IMDb |access-date=April 8, 2021}}</ref> She appears alongside [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] at the unveiling of the Great Wall that separates Super Hero City from Villainville and helping citizens into the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] Shelters. In the episode "Mysterious Mayhem at Mutant Academy", she uses Lockheed to chase [[Reptil]] and the hypnotized X-Men out of the girls' bathroom.

===Film===
* In the first [[20th Century Fox]] film ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'', she has a small cameo, played by Sumela Kay.<ref name="cbr">{{cite web |url=https://www.cbr.com/xmen-kitty-pryde-every-film-tv-appearance-ranked/ |title=X-Men: Every Film & TV Appearances of Kitty Pryde, Ranked |website=CBR |last=Allan |first=Scoot |date=September 28, 2020 |access-date=April 8, 2021}}</ref> She is referenced as the "girl in Illinois who can walk through walls" by [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Senator Kelly]]. She is shown in Xavier's class when Wolverine walks in; she returns for her books which she had left behind, grabs them, and phases through the door on her way out. Xavier responds with a cheerful "Bye, Kitty" while Wolverine looks on, startled.
* In [[20th Century Fox]]'s second sequel: ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]'', she has a brief appearance played by [[Katie Stuart]].  She is shown phasing through walls and through people to escape [[William Stryker]]'s military forces during their attack on the [[X-Mansion]]. Another scene shows her falling through her bed to avoid an assault. She shares a room with [[Siryn]]; in the novelization it is stated that this is because her phasing ability gives her partial protection from Siryn's scream. When the President of the United States asks Professor Xavier how he got the files he gave him, Xavier replies that he knows a little girl who can walk through walls.
* In [[20th Century Fox]]'s third sequel: ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'', she is portrayed by [[Elliot Page]],{{efn|name=Elliot}} and has a central role.<ref>{{cite news | title = 'Ellen Page Accuses Brett Ratner of Homophobic Behavior on 'X-Men' Set' | url = https://variety.com/2017/film/news/ellen-page-brett-ratner-slur-woody-allen-1202612134/ | newspaper = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 2017-11-10 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200126180146/https://variety.com/2017/film/news/ellen-page-brett-ratner-slur-woody-allen-1202612134/ | archive-date = 2020-01-26 }}</ref> She serves as a rival to [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] for the romantic attentions of [[Iceman (Marvel Comics)|Iceman]], since their close friendship and their kiss (Only in the deleted scene) makes Rogue increasingly angry, and frustrated. She also joins the X-Men in the battle on [[Alcatraz Island]], breaking off from the battle to save [[Leech (comics)|Leech]] from the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]]. In the novelization of the film, it is hinted that at some point Kitty had a romantic relationship with [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], but that it had long since run its course, although Colossus appears to still retain feelings towards her.

At the beginning of the film, she has been using this ability to repeatedly send [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] four days back in time whenever the Sentinels attack, thus; preventing her group from ever engaging them by having him warn the past team before they are detected. In order to prevent the Sentinels' creation, she sends Wolverine back to 1973 (chosen as the strain of sending someone else back that far would snap their mind, with Logan's healing factor the only thing that makes such a trip survivable for him) and was gravely injured when Wolverine becomes violent; due to provocation from events in 1973. After the timeline was successfully altered, Kitty is seen teaching a class at the X-Mansion with Colossus. In the film's alternate release, called ''The Rogue Cut'', Kitty's injuries from sending Wolverine back to the past result in the X-Men rescuing Rogue to take over for her. Rogue absorbs Kitty's powers and takes over, stabilizing Wolverine and Kitty helps Magneto flee a Sentinel attack.<ref name="RogueCut">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2211098/x-men-rogue-cut-review/|title=Every Secret We Learned Watching The 'X-Men: Rogue Cut'|last=McNally|first=Victoria|date=July 12, 2015|publisher=[[MTV.com]]|access-date=July 17, 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150716044600/http://www.mtv.com/news/2211098/x-men-rogue-cut-review/|archive-date=July 16, 2015}}</ref>
