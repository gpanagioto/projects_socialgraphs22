Okay, thank you very much. Yes, you can pick him up tonight. Bye now. Now boys, I hope you've learned your lesson. ''You can't care for this child!'' Yes, but you don't actually get involved with the child's life. You're supposed to just send money, and once in a while they write you a letter. You see, Marvin didn't grow up in a normal place like South Park. Because he can't! Because eight-year olds can't be parents!  I can't, I, umm...I'm very busy. I send my five dollars a month, see?
