It's not safe for our kids to be in this school! You do understand that up to 5% of kids with vaccines can still be at risk! Everyone has to do it, or it doesn't matter! Aw, come on, Mrs. Cartman! All major medical organizations state that vaccines are safe! The CDC, the FDA, UNICEF, and the US Department of Health! Of, of course you care. Nobody likes seeing their child in pain. Maybe... maybe you should just let us take care of getting Eric his shots. We'll find a way to make it completely painless for him, okay? Alright, alright. Bring him in.  The little boy's room is upstairs. Look, by the time he knows what's happened it'll already be over. Yes, yes. Come on, Thomas and Laura!   Thomas! Linda! Yo-you gotta get him!  I think the only way we're goin' to get Eric immunized is by bringing in an expert. Well, what happened? You said you could catch him! Barbecue? Whoa whoa, Mrs. Cartman. Everything is fine here.
