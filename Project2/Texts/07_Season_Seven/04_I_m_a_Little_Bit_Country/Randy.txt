The Founding Fathers would agree with our right to protest! How about we call this the rational side of town, and that the redneck side?! He's right.   Mayor, our peace rally has always been set for this Saturday! Now, these pro-war bastards are suddenly trying to say they get the town square. Look, nobody wants to hear a bunch of twangy country music propaganda! Oh, you think so? Bring the shizzle! Uh, boys, would you mind clearing the living room. We have to practice our big war protest song. The boys are going to give a presentation at ''our'' rally about how the Founding Fathers would agree with our right to protest!  Can you believe those hick sons of bitches? Manipulating those kids to be on their side. Nobody wants to here another pro-war country song! <i>Well I'm a little bit rock-n-roll-AH!</i> <i>And I'm a little for bringin' 'em home.</i> <i>No, but war shouldn't be our goal.</i> <i>If it means war, then we say NO!</i>  He's right. The strength of this country is the ability to do one thing and say another. <i>And I'm a little bit rock-n-roll-AH!</i> <i>And me, I'll be the caring soul.</i> Well, goodnight everybody. It sure has been great bringing you a hundred episodes.
