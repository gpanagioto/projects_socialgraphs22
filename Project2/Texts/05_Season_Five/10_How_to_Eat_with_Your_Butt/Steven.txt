 What is it, Martha? Our ssson! We realize that. But we just thought that maybe someone else had found Tommy, and then lost him again. We're pretty certain that it's our boy, considering his physical appearance. Martha and I have the... same condition. You may not have realized this, but we actually have buttocks where our heads should be. Yes. Over eleven people worldwide suffer from TPS. Martha and I were lucky enough to meet each other at a TPS convention in France. No no, don't be silly. You see, with TPS, the birth defect is on the exterior only. Behind this we still have all our vital head organs - tongue, eyes, nasal passages... Uh, Thompssson. Now, Martha, what did I say about getting our hopesss up? We understand you've seen our son.  They said to inquire four houses down. It was just such a coincidence, considering the photo. You may not have realized this, but Martha and I have buttocks where our heads should be. Tommy disappeared when he was only seven. Yes. He was in the care of our nanny at the time. Yes, but we last heard the nanny was heading west.  That's why we thought Colorado made sssssense. This certainly is a friendly town.  Please, please. It's not your fault. Delicious. Martha and I actually have buttocks where our heads should be. Well, it was 1982. Tommy was only six at the time. Yes, but since he appeared to be at least eight in the photo,  we assumed someone had seen him since we did. We don't really like chili; it makes us throw up.  Son! Oh, our same ol' Ben! Aw, son.  Aw son!
