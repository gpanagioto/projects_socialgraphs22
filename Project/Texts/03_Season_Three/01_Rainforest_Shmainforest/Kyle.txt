Fuck off, Cartman! <i>[alarmed]</i> No! That's a stereotype. God-damn, it's hot out here! No, dude. That's a branch. No. That's the same branch again. What's the Yanagopa? My guess would be yes. Dude, we're totally lost! We're gonna die out here! Miss Stevens, you have a bug on your back. Um, no. Rainforests suck! I wanna go home! <i>[Kyle runs into an adult]</i> Aaaaa! There's a dude here! <i>[a soldier holding a shotgun]</i> I want two tostadas and mild sauce. Yeah. I think we should get the hell out of here. Hey! Yeah. It happened once before. Hey, it's a fire. That means there must be people.  What the hell? Yeah! Fragile my ass! Dude! Bulldozers rule! You bastards! They're... they're bastards. What? Whoa, dude!
