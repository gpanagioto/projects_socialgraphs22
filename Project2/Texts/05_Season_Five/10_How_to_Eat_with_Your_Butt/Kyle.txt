I hate picture day at school! It's always some gay-ass photographer with some gay-ass backdrop of New England! No. This is taking forever. What, Cartman? It isn't that funny, Cartman. But I never take off my hat. This ''is'' how I look natural.  Gay-ass.  Hello? Hello?  Cartman?  Why'd you call us? ...You put Kenny's picture on a milk carton?? No it's not, Cartman. You know, there really are couples out there who are missing children. ...Okay Cartman, what do you want this time? ...Nuh uh.  Hohly crahap, duhude, heh!  Uh Eh-heh. L-look, if you want an explanation, you you'd better go to Kenny's house. Ehheh, Cartman, what the hell are you doing?  Blew a funny fuse? Butters! Hey Butters! You have to check this out! You gotta come to Kenny's house with us. Alright.  Butters! Hey Butters! They found the butt-face people's son, Butters. They're gonna have a big reunion at the milk company! Dude, that poor kid.  Well, looks like everything turned out alright for them. Well wait a minute. Don't you see what happened? Everything turned out okay for those people. And so now you can laugh. When Cartman first opened the door, and saw the Thompsons, he felt bad for playing a joke on them. Now that everything's turned out alright, he's able to laugh. There is no such thing as a funny fuse, Cartman. You felt bad. Our little man is growing up, Stan. He's growing up.
