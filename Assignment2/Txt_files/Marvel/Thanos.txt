'''Thanos''' is a<!--Do not add "fictional" as it is tautological; supervillains (and characters in general) are by definition implied to be fictionalized to some extent.--> [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He was created by writer-artist [[Jim Starlin]], and first appeared in ''[[Iron Man (comic book)|The Invincible Iron Man]]'' #55 ([[cover date]] February 1973). An [[Eternals (comics)|Eternal]]–[[Deviant (comics)|Deviant]] warlord from the moon [[Titan (Marvel Comics location)|Titan]], Thanos is regarded as one of the most powerful beings in the [[Marvel Universe]]. He has clashed with many heroes including the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]], the [[Fantastic Four]], the [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]], and the [[X-Men]].

In creating Thanos, Starling drew inspiration from [[Jack Kirby]]'s ''[[New Gods]]'' series for [[DC Comics]], particularly the character of [[Darkseid]]. Thanos is usually portrayed as a villain, although many stories depict him as believing his actions to be justified. Perhaps the character's best-known storyline is ''[[The Infinity Gauntlet]]'' (1991), the culmination of several story arcs that see him gather the six [[Infinity Gems]] and use them to kill half of the universe's population, including many of its heroes, to woo [[Death (Marvel comics)|Mistress Death]], the living embodiment of death in the Marvel Universe. Although these events were later undone, the storyline has remained one of the most popular published by Marvel.

Debuting in the [[Bronze Age of Comic Books|Bronze Age of comic books]], the character has appeared in almost five decades of Marvel publications, as well as many media adaptations, including animated television series and video games. In the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], the [[Thanos (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|character]] was first played by [[Damion Poitier]] in the film ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012) and then by [[Josh Brolin]] in ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' (2014), ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' (2015), ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018), ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019), and the first season of the animated series ''[[What If...? (TV series)|What If...?]]'' (2021).

==Origin==
Writer-artist [[Jim Starlin]] conceived of Thanos of Titan during college [[psychology]] classes. As Starlin described:

{{Blockquote | style=font-size:100% | I went to college between doing [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. military]] service and getting work in comics, and there was a psych class and I came up with Thanos&nbsp;... and [[Drax the Destroyer]], but I'm not sure how he fit into it, just [[anger management]] probably. So I came up to Marvel, and [[Editing|editor]] [[Roy Thomas]] asked if I wanted to do an issue of ''[[Iron Man (comic book)|Iron Man]]''. I felt that this may be my only chance ever to do a character, not having the confidence that my career was going to last anything longer than a few weeks. So they got jammed into it. Thanos was a much thinner character and Roy suggested beefing him up, so he's beefed up quite a bit from his original sketches&nbsp;... and later on I liked beefing him up so much that he continued to grow in size.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080122032717/http://www.adelaidecomicsandbooks.com/starlin.htm "Jim Starlin"]. Adelaide Comics and Books. Archived via the [[Wayback Machine]]. Retrieved March 25, 2014.</ref>}}

Starlin has admitted the character's look was influenced by [[Jack Kirby]]'s [[Darkseid]]:

{{Blockquote | style=font-size:100% | Kirby had done the [[New Gods]], which I thought was terrific. He was over at [[DC Comics|DC]] at the time. I came up with some things that were inspired by that. You'd think that Thanos was inspired by [[Darkseid]], but that was not the case when I showed up. In my first Thanos drawings, if he looked like anybody, it was [[Metron (comics)|Metron]]. I had all these different gods and things I wanted to do, which became Thanos and the Titans. Roy took one look at the guy in the Metron-like chair and said: "Beef him up! If you're going to steal one of the New Gods, at least rip off Darkseid, the really good one!"<ref>{{cite web |first=Brian |last=Cronin |url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/06/24/comic-book-legends-revealed-266/ |title=Comic Book Legends Revealed #266 |work=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=2010-06-24 |access-date=2010-06-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627123430/http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/06/24/comic-book-legends-revealed-266/ |archive-date=2010-06-27 |url-status=live }}</ref>}}

==Fictional character biography==
Thanos was born on [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Titan (Marvel Comics location)|Titan]] as the son of [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]] [[Mentor (A'lars)|A'lars]] and [[Sui-San]], the nephew of [[Zuras]], and the grandnephew of [[Uranos (comics)|Uranos]]. His brother is [[Starfox (comics)|Eros of Titan]]. Thanos carries the [[Deviant (comics)|Deviants]] gene, and as such, shares the physical appearance of the Eternals' cousin race. Shocked by his appearance and the belief that he would destroy all life in the universe, Sui-San went insane and attempted to kill him, but she was stopped by A'lars. During his school years, Thanos was a [[pacifist]]<ref>'' Thanos Rising'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> and would only play with his brother Eros and pets. By adolescence, Thanos had become fascinated with [[nihilism]] and entropy, worshipping and eventually falling in love with the physical embodiment of [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Mistress Death]].<ref>''Thanos Rising'' #3, ''Iron Man'' vol 1 #55. Marvel Comics.</ref> As an adult, Thanos augmented his physical strength and powers through his superior scientific knowledge using a combination of mysticism and cybernetic enhancements.<ref>''Thanos'' (Vol. 2) #13. Marvel Comics.</ref> He also attempted to create a new life for himself by siring many children as well as becoming a pirate. He finds no fulfillment in either until he is visited again by Mistress Death, for whom he murders his offspring and his pirate captain.<ref>''Thanos Rising'' #4–5. Marvel Comics.</ref>  

===Cosmic Cube and Infinity Gems===
Wishing to impress Mistress Death, Thanos gathers an army of villainous aliens and begins a nuclear bombardment of Titan that kills millions of his race.<ref name="AvengersAnnual7">''Avengers Annual'' #7 (1977). Marvel Comics.</ref> Seeking universal power in the form of the [[Cosmic Cube]], Thanos travels to Earth. Prior to landing, his vessel destroys a nearby car as a family witnesses his arrival.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #30 (Jan. 1974). Marvel Comics.</ref> Unbeknownst to Thanos, two of the family members in the vehicle survive: the father's spirit is preserved by the Titanian cosmic entity Kronos and is given a new form as [[Drax the Destroyer]] while the daughter is found by Thanos's father, Mentor, and is raised to become the heroine [[Moondragon]]. Thanos eventually locates the Cube, and also attracts the attention of Mistress Death. Willing the Cube to make him omnipotent, Thanos then discards the Cube. He imprisons Kronos and taunts [[Kree]] hero [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Captain Marvel]], who, with the aid of superhero team the Avengers and [[ISAAC (comics)|ISAAC]] (a super-computer based on Titan), is eventually able to defeat Thanos by destroying the Cube.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #33 (July 1974). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Thanos later comes to the aid of [[Adam Warlock]] in a war against the [[Magus (comics)|Magus]] and his religious empire. During the process, he ends up adopting [[Gamora]] in order to use her as his assassin and kill Adam Warlock before becoming Magus.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #178–181 (Feb.–Aug. 1975)</ref><ref>''Warlock'' #9–11 (Oct. 1975&nbsp;– Jan. 1976).

Warlock summons the Avengers and Captain Marvel to stop Thanos, although the plan is foiled when Thanos kills Warlock. The Titan regroups and captures the heroes, who are freed by Spider-Man and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]]. Thanos is finally stopped by Warlock, whose spirit emerges from the Soul Gem and turns the Titan to stone.<ref name="AvengersAnnual7"/><ref>''Marvel Two-in-One Annual'' #2 (1977).

Marvel Comics.</ref> and during their battles Thanos decimates the planet [[Rigellians (comics)|Rigel-3]].<ref>''Thor Annual'' (2000). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Thanos then uses the heroes Thor and [[Genis-Vell]] (Captain Marvel's son) against the death god Walker, who attempts to woo Mistress Death and then destroy the entity after being rejected.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' vol. 2, #17–19 (June–Aug. 2001). Marvel Comics.</ref> Thanos then devises a plan to become the All-Father of a new pantheon of gods created by himself. Thanos, however, finds himself opposed by the Avengers' former member [[Mantis (Marvel Comics)|Mantis]] and her son [[Sequoia (comics)|Quoi]], who apparently is destined to be the Celestial Messiah. Thanos abandons this plan after having to unite with Mistress Death to destroy the "Rot", a cosmic aberration in deep space caused by Thanos's incessant love for Death.<ref>''Avengers: Celestial Quest'' #1–8 (Nov. 2001&nbsp;– June 2002). Marvel Comics.</ref> Thanos also once conducted extensive research on genetics, studying many of the universe's heroes and villains before [[cloning]] them, and gene-spliced his own [[DNA]] into the subjects. Although he later abandons the project, five clones survive, being versions of [[Professor X]], Iron Man, [[Gladiator (Kallark)|Gladiator]], [[Doctor Strange]], and Galactus respectively. A sixth and unnamed version of Thanos also appears, and it is revealed the incarnations of Thanos encountered in the past by Thor and Ka-Zar were actually clones. The true Thanos&nbsp;– with the aid of Adam Warlock, Gamora, Pip the Troll, Spider-Man, Captain Marvel, and Dr. Strange&nbsp;– destroys the remaining clones.<ref>''The Infinity Abyss'' #1–6 (2002). Marvel Comics.</ref>

When the ancient Egyptian [[pharaoh]] Akhenaten uses a [[Heart of the Universe|source of cosmic power]], the Heart of the Universe, to seize power in present-day Earth (killing most of Earth's heroes in the process), Thanos uses a time-travel stratagem to defeat him. Thanos then uses the Heart of the Universe to reverse Akhenaten's actions and was also compelled to correct a flaw in the universe, for which Mistress Death kisses him, and speaks to him for the first time. Changed by the experience, Thanos advises confidant Adam Warlock he will no longer seek universal conquest.<ref>''Marvel: The End'' #1–6 (May–Aug. 2003). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Thanos decides to atone for the destruction of Rigel-3, and agrees to aid a colony of Rigellians in evacuating their planet before Galactus can consume it. During the course of this mission Thanos learns Galactus is collecting the Infinity Gems in an effort to end his unyielding hunger. Thanos later learns Galactus is being manipulated into releasing a multiversal threat called Hunger, which feeds on entire universes. Despite opposition from Thanos, Galactus unwittingly frees the entity, and when its intentions are revealed, the pair team up and attempt to destroy it.<ref>''Thanos'' #1–6(Dec. 2003&nbsp;– April 2004). Marvel Comics.</ref>

En route to the [[Kyln]], an intergalactic prison, Thanos meets Death for the first time since re-building existence with the Heart of the Universe. Death claims to be worth wooing, but says Thanos must offer something other than death. At the Kyln Thanos encounters Peter Quill, who has retired himself from the role of [[Star-Lord]], and the Strontian warrior [[Gladiator (Kallark)|Gladiator]] of the [[Shi'ar]] Empire, who are both prisoners, as well as the [[Beyonder]], who has been rendered amnesiac by its choice to assume a [[humanoid]] female form. Thanos battles the Beyonder, causing its mind to shut down and leaving its power trapped within a comatose physical form. Thanos then instructs the Kyln officers to keep the Beyonder on life support indefinitely in order to prevent the entity from being reborn.<ref>''Thanos'' #7–9 (May 2004). Marvel Comics.</ref> The destruction frees Thanos and his fellow inmates, and he finds himself accompanied by the chaos-mite Skreet in his plans to leave the remains of the prison. He discovers, however, that the destruction wrought by the battle with the Beyonder has freed the last prisoner brought in by Peter Quill before he gave up the title of Star-Lord: the [[Fallen One]], revealed to be the true first [[Herald of Galactus]], who had been held in a container deep in the Kyln. Thanos defeats the former Herald and places him under complete mental control.<ref>''Thanos'' #10–12 (July&nbsp;– Sept. 2004). Marvel Comics.</ref> He later appears in [[Wisconsin]] attempting to charge a weapon called the Pyramatrix with the life force of everyone on Earth until he is defeated by [[Squirrel Girl]]. After the battle, [[Uatu]] the Watcher appears and confirms to Squirrel Girl that she defeated the real Thanos, not a clone or copy.<ref>''GLX-Mas Special'' (December 2005). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===''Annihilation''===
{{Main|Annihilation (comics)}}
During the [[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation War]] Thanos allies himself with the genocidal villain [[Annihilus]]. When the Annihilation Wave destroys the Kyln, Thanos sends the Fallen to check on the status of the Beyonder, whose mortal form he finds has perished.

Eros tells him about an enemy made out darkness that will destroy Thanos in the future. Eros and Thanos craft a plan, but when they go to implement it Thanos is confronted by his future self who tells him to alter the plan to ensure his safety. The future Thanos then takes control of the past Thanos' body.<ref>''Thanos: The Infinity Siblings''</ref>

Under the control of his future self Thanos began searching through ancient temples and sites to find something that would allow him to eventually become like his future. Through his journey he was also forced to kill Adam Warlock who might interfere with his future's plan. After being unable to locate Eros, his future self tells Thanos that Eros was extremely important to his cosmic masterwork. Then after locating an moving comet Thanos goes to the comet which contained a treasure more powerful than the Infinity Gems. Despite the speed of comet being enough to immediately vaporize any being Thanos was able to get it since he "existed outside the norm".

However, it is all in vain as Thanos simply did not care, but these temporal paradoxes did allow present Thanos to use that little access of his future's power to talk to Eros through his past selves. He directs Eros and Pip to his future's psyche and had Eros free him, but unfortunately this allows future Thanos to finally find Eros and had him absorbed inside his universe. Then Adam Warlock came and refuses to free Thanos because he would end up as Eros and tells Thanos that trust would be the only thing that would stop future Thanos. As his future self saw that existence was just a never-endless cycle which trapped all beings decided to commit suicide and "free" everyone from this "torture". Thankfully, Kang prevented Eros from going to talk to Thanos' past selves which allowed him to avoid capture.

Starfox was able to preempt her attempt at patricide while inviting his wayward tyrant of a brother aboard their vessel. Thanos mentioned the only way for him to be relieved of his mortality was to seek out the God Quarry heralded by The Witches of Infinity. Starfox initially wrote this off as fable and folklore. Now on the path to the cosmic coven set at the edge of the known universe, Thanos and crew stop short of a black hole, knowing full well that it is where the witches make their home. The Mad Titan jumps into the pinhole of nothingness alongside his brother, whom not trusting his butcherous sibling with the supposed infinite power of said collective; having survived the crushing force of the singularity they dove into, Thanos and Eros are greeted by the Coven at the godly graveyard.<ref>''Thanos'' (Vol 2) #8 (Aug. 2017).</ref>

Thanos demands the three that are one to return his godhood to him. Starfox tries his best to charm the enchantresses only to be rebuked by them, much to Thanos's joy when they prematurely aged him. Seeing as it was neither their place to destroy nor turn away those seeking them, The Witches profess the only way for the warlord to be made whole again was to climb down into the God Quarry and await a trial that would test his soul.

But he is unable to escape the nagging feeling that he has forgotten something, till the quarry itself wearing the guise of Falcon reminds him of who he used to be; tempting him to live as a hero and a man at peace for the first time in his immortal life. But Thanos laughs maniacally as he coldly rebukes such a path, ruthlessly killing his would be friends and allies while choosing to remain whom he always was. His cosmic might returned to him, Thanos is freed from the God Quarry, wherein he immediately accosts his brother Eros and threatens the coven to release him from their domain so that he might do away with Thane once and for all.<ref>''Thanos'' (Vol 2) #10 (Oct. 2017).</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Thanos is a mutant member of the race of superhumans known as the [[Titan (Marvel Comics location)|Titan]]ian Eternals.

Thanos is a supergenius in virtually all known fields of advanced science and has created technology far exceeding that which is found on contemporary Earth. He often employs a transportation chair capable of space flight, [[force shield|force field]] projection, [[teleportation]], [[time travel]], and movement through [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]]s.

The [[Reddit]] forum /r/ThanosDidNothingWrong, dedicated to sharing theories and memes about the character, went viral in July 2018 when it was announced that half of the forum's subscribers would be banned, mirroring Thanos’ plan to eradicate half of all life in the universe.

A May 2019 ''[[Forbes]]'' column posited that "Thanos did nothing wrong" has become a popular internet meme, and that the film ''Endgame'' provides some evidence in favor of this view, in particular when Captain America says, "I saw a pod of whales when I was coming over the bridge . . . There's fewer ships, cleaner water." The author notes that given the contemporary [[extinction]] crisis driven by human actions, "you could indeed argue that Thanos did nothing wrong -- and in the long run, the villain might have actually saved the world."<ref>{{cite news|last=Chamary|first=JV|date=May 7, 2019|title=The Science Of 'Avengers: Endgame' Proves Thanos Did Nothing Wrong|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jvchamary/2019/05/07/avengers-endgame-biodiversity/#21b2744d775b|work=Forbes|access-date=May 29, 2019|archive-date=August 18, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210818125300/https://www.forbes.com/sites/jvchamary/2019/05/07/avengers-endgame-biodiversity/#21b2744d775b|url-status=live}}</ref>
