Because we had to choose between this and home ec, and we didn't wanna be sissies?  Tweek is! Now way, dude. Home ec is for girls. I don't know. He's such a wuss. No he's not dude. Craig is a wuss. How much? You're on! Hey Tweek. Dude. Craig chooses you. He wants to fight. Yeah. He's all pissed off at you. So, will you fight? He's really got it out for you, dude. Super. See you there.  Mr. Adler! Mr. Ad-ler! The bell rang. Can we go? Come on, you guys.  This is gonna be so sweet, dude. You're on, fatass!  How come you wanna take home ec., Kenny? Aw, hell! Tweek? How come you didn't show up for the fight, Tweek?! Yeah. He was standing there waiting for you, and he was all like, "Man, Tweek's a wuss," and we were all like, "No he's not, Craig," and he was all like, "Yeah he is, he isn't showing up. He's a big wuss, and he has crooked teeth!" Yeah, it was weak. Tomorrow? Okay, so, just to set the record straight here, the fight will be happening out by the tetherball pole at 3:30. Tweek just weighed in at 48 pounds, Craig at 45. Stay pissed, Tweek. Stay pissed.  All right. Here we go. Well? Huh?  Aw, dude, come on!!  All right, all right, screw it! We have to postpone the fight 'til Tweek and Craig can learn how to fight. All right. Tweek, we'll teach you how to fight, and Cartman, you teach Craig. Oh yeah? Well, I'm gonna have my uncle Jimbo teach Tweek how to box! Fine! We'll see you back here tomorrow! Damn it! Okay, the time has finally come.  You ready Tweek? You ready Craig? Let's get in on! Ye-hah! Come on, Tweek! You got him! Yeah. Here they are. Tweek and Craig are fighting. We're just watching.  Oh my God, they killed Kenny! Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here. Hi. We're here to visit our good friends, Tweek and Craig. Hey, you guys. How are you feeling? Well, uh. We just came by because we have something to tell you. So I guess we'll be going now, and live with the knowledge that... you're both kind of sissies.   Well, I mean, that's what was on the news. Come on, Tweek! You got him!
