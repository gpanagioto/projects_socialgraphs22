 What are you talking about? Sharon, have, have you seen Stan? Oh, Jesus, what has gotten into that kid?! Yeah, but when ''we'' did it we actually ''stood'' for something. I mean, remember Woodstock, Sharon? We actually did something there.  S-stan. STAAAN!  My son is in there! Duh-uh!  Stan! Stan! Sta-ogh. Ugh!  Eric, you were right. About the hippies. Could you... get rid of them for us now? Please. Some of our kids are in there. We should have listened to you earlier. We're just asking you to try. The whole town even got together and, and baked you a cake.   It's yours.  My God... I'm the... only scientist in town. You got a better idea, Steven?! Dammit, my son is in there! Well I... guess this is it, Sharon. Check. Vehicle shell holding!  The drill is getting too hot from all the hippies.  Somebody's gonna have to go outside and activate the backup boosters. Which cord is it? I'm a geologist! Nyugh! It's working! It's, it's working! Stan!
