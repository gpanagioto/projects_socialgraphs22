'''Norman Osborn''' is a [[fictional character|<!-- Please do not specify what type of character you think. Categories like "superhero" & "supervillian" are subjective. It's better to use a generic term and let the reader decide for themselves.--> fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character, created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]], first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #14 (July 1964) as the first and best-known incarnation of the '''[[Green Goblin]]'''.

As the amoral [[business magnate|industrialist]] head of [[Oscorp]], Norman was exposed to an experimental formula which enhanced his physical abilities and intellect, but also drove him to insanity. Having endured as [[Spider-Man]]'s [[archenemy]], Osborn has been part of the superhero's [[The Night Gwen Stacy Died|defining]] [[Clone Saga|stories]] as well as being the father of [[Harry Osborn]], the grandfather of [[Normie Osborn]] and [[Gabriel Stacy and Sarah Stacy|Gabriel and Sarah Stacy]], and the killer of [[Gwen Stacy]], [[Ben Reilly]] and [[Flash Thompson]] (the latter two later being resurrected). Although his primary obsession is [[Spider-Man]], Osborn has often come into conflict with [[Iron Man]], [[Captain America]] and other superheroes in the [[Marvel Universe]]. As the Goblin, he adopted a [[Halloween]]-themed appearance: dressing in a [[goblin]] costume, riding on a bat-shaped "Goblin Glider", and using an arsenal of high-tech weapons, such as grenade-like "Pumpkin Bombs", to terrorize [[New York City]]. Although Osborn sometimes works with other supervillains such as [[Doctor Octopus]], [[Doctor Doom]] and [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]] and groups like the [[Sinister Six]] and the [[Dark Avengers]], these relationships often collapse due to his desire for unbridled power. In recent years, Osborn gained [[Dark Reign (comics)|new status as a public hero]] as the original iteration of '''[[Iron Patriot]]'''. Following the events of ''[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]'', the Carnage symbiote was stolen from an old [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] storehouse by Osborn. With the combination of the symbiote and the Goblin serum, he went by as the '''[[Carnage (character)|Red Goblin]]'''.

The character has been in various top villain lists as one of Spider-Man's greatest [[List of Spider-Man enemies|enemies]] and one of the greatest comic book villains of all time. The character's popularity has seen him appear on a variety of merchandise, inspire real-world structures (such as theme park attractions) and be referenced in [[Green Goblin in other media|a number of media]]. He has been adapted to serve as Spider-Man's adversary in live-action, animated, and video game incarnations. [[Willem Dafoe]] played the [[Norman Osborn (Sam Raimi film series)|character]] in [[Sam Raimi]]'s [[Spider-Man (2002 film series)|''Spider-Man'' film trilogy]] and reprised the role in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] film ''[[Spider-Man: No Way Home]]'' (2021), while [[Chris Cooper]] played the character in the film ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]'' (2014).

Marvel Comics editor and head writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]] are credited with creating the character; they each collaborated with one another on how the character would be portrayed.<ref name="Kindersly3">{{cite book|last1 = Manning|first1 = Matthew K.|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura|chapter= 1960s|title = Spider-Man Chronicle Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging|publisher = Dorling Kindersley|year = 2012|page = 26|isbn = 978-0756692360|quote= Spider-Man's arch nemesis, the Green Goblin, as introduced to readers as the 'most dangerous foe Spidey's ever fought'.

The Green Goblin debuted in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #14.<ref>{{cite book|last1 = Manning|first1 = Matthew K.|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura|chapter= 1960s|title = Spider-Man Chronicle Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2012|page = 26|isbn = 978-0756692360|quote= Spider-Man's arch nemesis, the Green Goblin, as introduced to readers as the 'most dangerous foe Spidey's ever fought'.

According to both Stan Lee and [[John Romita, Sr.]], who replaced Ditko as the title's artist, [[Stan Lee|Lee]] always wanted the Green Goblin to be someone Peter Parker knew, while Ditko wanted his civilian identity to be someone who hadn't yet been introduced.<ref>Ro, Ronin.

Because, he said, in real life, very often a villain turns out to be somebody that you never knew. And I felt that that would be wrong. I felt, in a sense, it would be like cheating the reader. ... if it's somebody you didn't know and had never seen, then what was the point of following all the clues? I think that frustrates the reader".<ref name="Alter104"/> However, Lee prefaced this statement by admitting that, due to his self-professed poor memory, he may have been confusing the Green Goblin with a different character,<ref name="Alter104"/> and in an earlier essay he had said that he could not remember whether Norman Osborn being the Green Goblin was his idea or Ditko's.<ref>{{cite book|title=Spider-Man Vs.

Though Osborn would not be introduced by name until ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #37, Ditko has said that a character he drew in the background of two panels in issue #23 was intended to be Osborn, seeded in advance of the reveal. Lending credence to Ditko's claim, this then-nameless character—a member of a businessmen's club and a friend of J. Jonah Jameson—reappeared in a scene in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #25, visiting Jameson at his office, then again in the businessman's club in #26 and #27, and when Norman was formally introduced in issue #37, he too was stated to be a member of the club and friend of Jameson's.<ref name="Ditko"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2013/01/04/comic-book-legends-revealed-400-part-1/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424153033/http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2013/01/04/comic-book-legends-revealed-400-part-1/|title=Comic Book Legends Revealed #400 (Part 1) {{!}} Comics Should Be Good @ CBR|date=2013-01-04|language=en-US|archive-date=April 24, 2008|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

I just accepted the fact that it was going to be Norman Osborn when we plotted it. I had been following the last couple of issues and didn't think there was really much mystery about it.

In the landmark story "[[The Night Gwen Stacy Died]]" (''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #121-122), the [[Green Goblin]] kills [[Gwen Stacy]] and later dies in a fight against Spider-Man. However, the story's writer, [[Gerry Conway]], had Harry Osborn adopt the Green Goblin identity in the aftermath of "The Night Gwen Stacy Died", later remarking that "I never had any intention of getting rid of the Green Goblin as a concept".<ref>{{cite journal|last= Williams|first= Scott E.|date= October 2010|title= Gerry Conway: Everything but the Gwen Stacy Sink|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= #44| page= 14|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref> Harry Osborn's becoming the Green Goblin was mostly well received, with fans remarking that Harry was more menacing than his father had ever been.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Walker|first= Karen|date= October 2010|title= Gwen, the Goblin, and the Spider-Fans|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= #44| page= 20|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref> Writer [[Roger Stern]] later introduced the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]] to replace the Green Goblin as Spider-Man's [[archenemy]].<ref name="Creators">{{cite book |title=Comics Creators on Spider-Man |last=DeFalco |first=Tom |year=2004 |publisher=Titan Books |isbn=978-1-84023-422-0 }}</ref>

===Return===
During the "[[Clone Saga]]", a [[retcon]] was made, which determined that Norman Osborn survived the events of ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #122 and had been playing a behind-the-scenes role in Spider-Man's adventures since then.<ref name="Clone Saga">{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/comicstories.2581.take_10~colon~_marvel~apos~s_finest_couples |title=Love is in the air as Marvel.com's Secret Cabal picks the greatest Marvel romances of all in time for Valentine's Day &#124; Marvel.com News |publisher=Marvel.com |access-date=April 27, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Ginocchio|first=Mark|title= 10 Reasons Spider-Man's Clone Saga Isn't As Bad As You Remembered |url=https://comicbook.com/blog/2014/08/28/10-reasons-spider-mans-clone-saga-isnt-as-bad-as-you-remember/|work=ComicBook|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424153033/http://comicbook.com/blog/2014/08/28/10-reasons-spider-mans-clone-saga-isnt-as-bad-as-you-remember/ |date=August 31, 2014|archive-date=April 24, 2008}}</ref> During the "Clone Saga", the Spider-Man writers were met with a massive outcry from many readers after the decision to replace Peter Parker with his clone [[Ben Reilly]] as the true Spider-Man. Eventually, the writers decided to reveal that one of Spider-Man's arch-enemies had been manipulating events from behind the scenes. The initial plan was to use [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], but they felt a more down-to-earth character was needed.<ref>[http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2008/09/25/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-174/ Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed 174], ''Comics Should be Good'' [[Comic Book Resources]], September 25, 2008</ref> It was then suggested that the semi-[[zombie|zombified]] cyborg "[[Mendel Stromm|Gaunt]]" be revealed as [[Harry Osborn]] (who was killed in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #200).

Gaunt was a late entry to the controversial storyline, created mainly as a [[plot device]] to return Harry to life; the plan for the character included Harry regaining his humanity, taking credit for tricking Peter into thinking he was a clone, and assuming his father's Green Goblin identity. However, this narrative was rejected by newly promoted [[editor in chief]] [[Bob Harras]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Goletz|first=Andrew|title=Life of Reilly, Part 23|url=http://lifeofreillyarchives.blogspot.com/2008/03/part-23.html|date=March 5, 2008}}</ref> and eventually Norman was chosen to be the mastermind. Following the Clone Saga, Green Goblin re-established himself as a supervillain and Spider-Man's nemesis, serving as the main antagonist of several arcs thereafter.<ref>{{cite web|last=Conley|first=Nicholas|title= Spider-Man: 15 Things You Never Knew About The Clone Saga|url=https://screenrant.com/spider-man-clone-saga-trivia-facts/| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424153033/http://screenrant.com/spider-man-clone-saga-trivia-facts/ |work=[[Screen Rant]]| archive-date =April 24, 2008|date=2016-12-18}}</ref>

He was one of several characters offered to Ellis, who picked him because, according to ''Thunderbolts'' editor Molly Lazer, "[t]here was something about Norman, his instability, and his fixation with Spider-Man that Warren liked, so he's in the book!"<ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=95109 Better Know a Thunderbolt: Green Goblin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206203540/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=95109 |date=February 6, 2009 }}, [[Newsarama]], December 21, 2006</ref> Ellis admitted not being very familiar with the character, saying: "All I remember of the Norman Osborn character was from the Spider-Man reprints my parents used to buy me when I was very young, and Norman Osborn was this guy with a weird rippled crewcut who was always sweating and his eyes were always bulging out of his head.

The mini-series would lead into a dual storyline running in the pages of ''The New Avengers'' #17–24 and ''The Avengers'' vol. 4 #18–24, in which the character formed a new version of the Dark Avengers and ultimately garnered new powers, having turned himself into a [[Super-Adaptoid]].<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Brian Michael Bendis]]|artist=[[Daniel Acuña]]|story=Avengers|title=The Avengers vol. 4 |issue=#23|date=February 2012|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
===Early life===
Norman was born in [[New Haven, Connecticut]] as the son of wealthy industrialist Amberson Osborn. Amberson, a brilliant student in the fields of science, became an alcoholic after losing control of a manufacturing company and fortune, and became physically abusive toward the family. Norman quickly came to despise his father, resolving to be a better [[Breadwinner model|breadwinner]] while developing early homicidal tendencies as a means of relieving the stress of his father's abuse.<ref>{{comic book reference|writer=[[J.M.

Blaise|penciller=[[Sal Buscema]], [[Jerry Bingham]]|inker=[[Jerry Bingham]]|story= The Spectacular Spider-Man Annual |title =Spider-Man|issue =#14|date=June 1994|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>

In college, where he studied [[chemistry]], [[business administration]], and [[electrical engineering]], Norman meets his [[Emily Osborn|college sweetheart]], who eventually marries him and has their son [[Harry Osborn|Harold "Harry" Osborn]]. In his adulthood, with the help of his college professor [[Mendel Stromm]], he co-founds the chemical company [[Oscorp|Oscorp Industries]] and establishes himself as CEO and President. The company was hugely successful, and Norman re-gained the wealth that he had lost during his childhood. However, his wife becomes ill and dies when Harry is barely a year old,<ref>{{comic book reference|writer=[[Roger Stern]]|artist=[[Ron Frenz]]|story= The Spectacular Spider-Man: Revenge of the Green Goblin |title =Spider-Man|issue =#1|date=October 2000|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> the stress of which pushes Norman to work harder, leading him to emotionally neglect Harry.

Hoping to gain more control of Oscorp Industries, Osborn accused Stromm of embezzlement and has his partner arrested and shares in his company sold to him. Searching his former mentor's possessions, Norman discovers an experimental strength/intelligence enhancement formula, but in attempting to create the serum, it turns green and explodes in his face. The accident greatly increases his intelligence and physical abilities as intended, but also has the side-effect of driving him into self-destructive insanity, just like his father from years ago.<ref>{{comic book reference|writer=[[Stan Lee]]|penciller=[[John Romita Sr.]]|inker=[[Mike Esposito (comics)|Mike Esposito]]|story= The Amazing Spider-Man |title =Spider-Man|issue =#40|date=September 1966|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>

===The original Green Goblin===

Norman adopts the Green Goblin identity with the goal of being the leader of organized crime in New York City, and intends to cement his position by defeating [[Spider-Man]]. Acting on his own as the Goblin, or through his employment of other super-criminals such as the [[Headsman (comics)|Headsman]],<ref>{{comic book reference|writer=[[Kurt Busiek]]|penciller=[[Pat Olliffe]]|inker=Pam Eklund, [[Al Milgrom]]|story= Untold Tales of Spider-Man |title =Spider-Man|issue =#8|date=April 1996|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> he would harass Spider-Man many times, but fail to achieve his goal.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Lee, Stan|penciller= Ditko, Steve|inker= Ditko, Steve|story= The Grotesque Adventure of the Green Goblin!|title= The Amazing Spider-Man|issue= #14, 17, 23, 26–27|date= July 1964}}</ref> Soon, Stromm returns from prison, and attempts to exact revenge on Osborn using an army of robots, but Norman is saved by Spider-Man, and Stromm apparently dies of a heart attack.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Lee, Stan|penciller= Ditko, Steve|inker= Ditko, Steve|story= Once Upon A Time, There Was A Robot...!|title= The Amazing Spider-Man|issue=#37|date= June 1964}}</ref>

In order to discover his nemesis's secret identity, Osborn exposes Spider-Man to a gas that nullifies the hero's spider-senses. This allows Osborn to stalk Spider-Man until he learns that his nemesis is [[Peter Parker]], a college student and his son's classmate and best friend. While Parker is going about civilian life, Osborn surprises and knocks Parker out with an asphyxiation grenade, taking the youth to his waterfront base. After unmasking himself to Parker, the latter goads him into recounting how he became the Goblin, and uses the time to break free. In the ensuing battle, Spider-Man accidentally knocks Osborn into a mass of electrical wires, [[Retrograde amnesia|wiping out his memory]]. Feeling sorry for his nemesis, and wishing to avoid the shame that would befall the Osborn family (especially Parker's best friend Harry), Spider-Man destroys the Goblin costume in the resulting fire and tells the authorities that Osborn lost his memory while helping to defeat the Goblin.<ref>{{cite comic| writer=Lee, Stan|penciller= Romita Sr., John|inker= Romita Sr., John|story= How Green Was My Goblin and The End Of The Green Goblin |title= The Amazing Spider-Man|issue=#39–40|date= August–September 1966}}</ref>

Soon, Osborn is troubled by repressed memories of the Goblin and Spider-Man. After a presentation on supervillains by [[NYPD]] Captain [[George Stacy]] restores Osborn's memory, he experiences a brief return to his Goblin persona. While abducting Parker's friends and threatening Parker's [[Aunt May|elderly aunt]], he is exposed to one of his own "psychedelic bombs", causing a [[Drug-induced amnesia|relapse of amnesia]].<ref>{{comic book reference|writer=[[Gerry Conway]]|penciller=[[John Romita Sr.]]|inker=John Romita Sr.|story= The Spectacular Spider-Man |title =Spider-Man|issue =#2|date= November 1968 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>

Later, Osborn stumbles upon an old Goblin hideout which, again, restores his memory. However, the shock of seeing Harry hospitalized, overdosed on drugs, causes Osborn's amnesia to return once more.<ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #96-98">{{comic book reference| writer= Lee, Stan|penciller= Kane, Gil|inker= Kane, Gil|story= Spider-Man |title = The Amazing Spider-Man |issue = #96-98 |date=May–July 1971 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> After the final restoration of his memories, the Goblin kidnaps and takes [[Gwen Stacy]] to a bridge.<ref>Saffel, p. 65, states, "In the battle that followed atop the Brooklyn Bridge (or was it the George Washington Bridge?)...." On page 66, Saffel reprints the panel of ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #121, page 18, in which Spider-Man exclaims, "The George Washington Bridge! It figures Osborn would pick something named after his favorite president. He's got the same sort of hangup for dollar bills!" Saffel states, "The span portrayed...is the GW's more famous cousin, the Brooklyn Bridge. ... To address the contradiction in future reprints of the tale, though, Spider-Man's dialogue was altered so that he's referring to the Brooklyn Bridge. But the original snafu remains as one of the more visible errors in the history of comics".</ref><ref>Sanderson, ''Marvel Universe'', p. 84, notes, "[W]hile the script described the site of Gwen's demise as the George Washington Bridge, the art depicted the Brooklyn Bridge, and there is still no agreement as to where it actually took place".</ref> During Spider-Man's rescue attempt, Osborn knocks Gwen [[The Night Gwen Stacy Died|off the bridge]], resulting in the girl's death. Spider-Man, traumatised and obsessed with revenge, tracks the Goblin to his hideout, and in the ensuing battle, Osborn is impaled by his own goblin glider and dies.<ref>{{comic book reference| writer= [[Gerry Conway]]|penciller= [[Gil Kane]]|inker= [[John Romita Sr.]], Tony Mortellaro |story= Spider-Man |title = [[The Night Gwen Stacy Died]] |issue = #121-122 |date= June – July 1973 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>

===Return===
Since his presumed death, Osborn had been retroactively established as an [[unseen character]]. While he lies in the morgue, it is revealed that the Goblin formula gave him a previously-unknown [[healing factor]] which restores him to life; in the process of sneaking out, he kills a homeless man with a similar physique to himself for clothing and to feign his death. No longer suffering from bouts of amnesia, Norman escapes to Europe, where he can move freely and unnoticed (later revealed he was in [[France]] for some time). During this time abroad, believed dead by the general public, he orchestrates several plots, including replacing [[Aunt May|May Parker]] with a genetically altered actress,<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #400 (1995) and The "Final Chapter" storyline in; ''The Sensational Spider-Man'' #32–33, ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #440–441, ''Spider-Man'' #97–98 and ''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #262–263 (1998).

Marvel Comics.</ref> prior to the timeline change, Harry's corpse, at one point, was exhumed and tested.<ref>''Spider-Man: Legacy of Evil'' #1 (June 1996). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Most significantly, however, he utilizes his fortune to build a vast network of criminals, spies, dupes and co-conspirators to help engineer what would be an [[Clone Saga|almost impossibly complex and meticulously planned plot]] to destroy Spider-Man's life. To achieve this, he's the leader of the Scrier cabal, taking as his pawns Seward Trainer, [[Judas Traveller]], the [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]] and the cyborg Gaunt, all of whom he utilizes to carry out revenge against Parker. It is this group of individuals who are crucial in duping Parker into believing that the youth is actually a clone of himself created by Jackal,<ref>Goletz, Andrew, and [[Glenn Greenberg]].{{cite web |archive-url=https://archive.today/20040205012253/http://www.newcomicreviews.com/GHM/specials/LifeOfReilly/ |archive-date=February 5, 2004 |access-date=January 29, 2017 |url=http://www.newcomicreviews.com/GHM/specials/LifeOfReilly/ |publisher=NewComicsReviews.com |title="Life of Reilly", 35-part series, ''GreyHaven Magazine'', 2003, n.d. |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> while claiming that the clone – who comes to be known as [[Ben Reilly]] – is actually the original.<ref>{{comic book reference|writer=[[Tom DeFalco]]|penciller=[[Sal Buscema]]|inker=[[Bill Sienkiewicz]]|story= Spider-Man |title = The Spectacular Spider-Man |issue =#226|date=July 1995|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> Frustrated by Parker's perseverance despite everything that's been inflicted,<ref name="Spider-Man 1996">{{cite comic|writer=[[Glenn Greenberg]]|artist=[[Kyle Hotz]]|story=The Osborn Journal|title=Spider-Man: The Osborn Journal|issue=1|date=February 1997|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> Osborn publicly reveals that he's alive on [[Halloween]]. During the battle that ensues between the two, Osborn attempts to kill Parker by impaling his nemesis with his goblin glider. When Reilly sacrifices himself to save Parker from Osborn (and immediately deteriorates upon death as all of the Jackal's clones do), Parker discovers of actually being the original. During this same period, Osborn was also responsible for the murder or abduction of Peter & Mary Jane's newborn daughter, after one of his allies apparently caused the stillbirth of the baby.<ref name="Peter Parker 1996"/>

Returning to his former seat of power, Osborn regains control of his business and also buys out the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'', humiliating former friend and societal peer [[J. Jonah Jameson]] as the latter no longer has control over the newspaper. He also torments [[Ben Urich]] and demands a retraction over an exposé of his time as the Goblin, providing faked evidence that he never was the supervillain, despite Urich's extensive research.<ref>{{comic book reference|writer=[[Kurt Busiek]]|penciller=[[Mark Texeira]]|inker=Mark Texeira|story= Spider-Man |title = Spider-Man: Legacy of Evil |issue =#1|date=June 1996|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> However, he saves his most sadistic treatment for Peter, acting not only as a constant reminder of all the pain he's inflicted on his nemesis over the years, but a looming threat that could strike at any time. This build-up of pressure eventually makes Spider-Man snap by savagely beating the civilian and non-resistant Osborn in front of the latter's [[CCTV]], which, combined with Osborn convincing the [[Trapster (comics)|Trapster]] to frame Spider-Man for murder, results in Spider-Man being a [[fugitive]] again.<ref name="Spectacular Spider-Man' 1997"/> To get around this, Peter [[Spider-Man: Identity Crisis|adopts four new identities]], using two of these identities to convince Trapster to expose Osborn's scheme,<ref>{{comic book reference|writer=[[Howard Mackie]]|penciller=[[John Romita Jr.]]|inker=Scott Hanna|story= Spider-Man |title = Peter Parker: Spider-Man|issue =#92|date=June 1998|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> and provide fake evidence that the individual that beat up Osborn was an impostor.<ref>{{comic book reference|writer=[[Glenn Greenberg]], [[J.M.

For a time, Osborn retires his costumed persona and uses a stand-in so as not to be suspected of being the Green Goblin.<ref>{{comic book reference|writer=[[Todd DeZago]]|penciller=[[Joe Bennett (artist)|Joe Bennett]]|inker=[[Al Milgrom]], [[Dan Green (artist)|Dan Green]]|story= Spider-Man |title = The Sensational Spider-Man — 'Spider-Hunt' Part 1 |issue =#258|date=March 1998|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> This fifth Goblin kidnaps Norman's [[Normie Osborn|grandson]] and clashes with the wanted and injured Spider-Man.<ref>{{comic book reference|writer=[[Todd DeZago]], [[J.M.

It is during this time that Peter learns May is alive and Osborn's actress died in May's place. Osborn's complete madness is evident, as he hallucinates unmasking and killing Peter; yet in reality Peter easily defeats him. He is rescued from custody thereafter by his cabal of henchmen.<ref>The "Final Chapter" storyline in; ''The Sensational Spider-Man'' #32–33, ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #440–441, ''Spider-Man'' #97–98 and ''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #262–263 (1998). Marvel Comics.</ref>

A few months later, the highly unstable Osborn has partially regained his sanity with the help of anti-psychotic drugs. He comes to see Parker as the son he had always wanted and attempts to have Parker take on the Green Goblin mantle using physiological torture, but ultimately fails.<ref>''Spider-Man: Revenge of the Green Goblin'' #1–3, ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #466, ''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #25 (2000). Marvel Comics.</ref> Osborn's next plan involves using [[Flash Thompson]] drive drunk a truck into Midtown High School, resulting in an accident that causes Thompson brain damage. This successfully enrages Parker into what Osborn anticipates will be a climactic battle. During this confrontation, the emotionally weary Parker tells Osborn of being tired of their constant battle, and declares a truce.<ref>''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #44–47 (2002). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Osborn's Goblin identity is revealed to the public once again through an investigation by [[Jessica Jones]], after Osborn murders one of the reporters from the ''Daily Bugle''. After a battle with Spider-Man and [[Luke Cage]], Osborn is arrested and sent to prison for the first time.<ref>{{comic book reference|writer=[[Brian Michael Bendis]]|penciller=[[Mark Bagley]]|inker=Scott Hanna|story= [[The Pulse (comics)|The Pulse]] |title = The Pulse |issue = #1–5 |date=April–August 2004|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> However, things were far from over. From behind bars, Osborn again masterminded a plan against Spider-Man. This time, he has [[Mac Gargan|MacDonald "Mac" Gargan]] as Scorpion kidnap May. The plan was for Spider-Man to break Osborn out of prison in exchange for Parker's aunt's life. Peter reluctantly agreed and with the help of the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] proceeded to break Osborn out, only to have twelve of his greatest enemies waiting on the outside.

Osborn had assembled a [[Sinister Twelve|team of supervillains]]. However, [[Mary Jane Watson]] had contacted [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], and the villains were faced not only by Spider-Man, but the combined might of [[Captain America]], [[Iron Man]], [[Hank Pym|Yellowjacket]], [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] and the [[Fantastic Four]]. During the fracas, the Goblin manages to escape and kidnap Mary Jane, taking Peter's love interest to the George Washington Bridge in order to replay the murder of the last love interest. However, [[Doctor Octopus]] intervenes, attacking the Goblin. Spider-Man is able to save Mary Jane after a bolt of lightning sends the two villains into the river. Following some verbal clues from the Goblin, Peter also discovers where he had hidden May, and rescues the latter as well. It is revealed that Osborn sent Peter a letter before the fight, thanking Peter for giving his life meaning and purpose, but Peter never received the letter due to moving to a different residence.<ref>''Marvel Knights: Spider-Man'' #1–12 (2004-2005). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Years after Gwen's death, it is revealed that Osborn had a [[one-night stand]] with Gwen, which led to Gwen's pregnancy with his [[Gabriel Stacy and Sarah Stacy|illegitimate twin children]]. Osborn thus has three motives for killing Gwen; revenge against Spider-Man, to prevent Gwen from talking of their affair and creating a scandal, and to take their children to raise by himself, thus being his ideal heirs. Mary Jane was the only person who knew of their encounter and their children's existence prior to Gwen's death, despising Osborn for his immoral behaviors long before discovering he's the villainous Goblin. Gabriel and Sarah (who rapidly aged to adulthood years because of the Goblin formula in their genes) return to attack Peter as Osborn has the twins believe that Peter is the twins' father who abandoned the two and responsible for Gwen's death to which Peter learned the details of Gwen's past with Osborn and the twins from Mary Jane. Peter is able to convince Sarah of Osborn's villainy, the truth of Sarah's paternity and circumstances of Gwen's death, and stabilized the Goblin physiology with a blood transfusion due to Peter's blood type matching Sarah's. Meanwhile, Gabriel personally learns the truth of his relation to Osborn after watching a video message at one of the Goblin lairs, aligning with his father to stabilize his own condition using a variation of the Goblin formula at the cost of sanity.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #509-514 (Aug. 2004–Jan. 2005). Marvel Comics.</ref> All of this was [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] during the ''[[Sinister War]]'' story-arc, when AI version of Harry Osborn's mind reveals that he masterminded a plan to get revenge of both his father and [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]]: he created the twins in a lab with the help of [[Mendel Stromm]] and he brainwashed Norman and [[Mary Jane Watson]] (thanks to Mysterio) into believing Gwen cheated on Peter with Osborn. The twins aged rapidly because of clonation issues (and not because of Osborn's Goblin Serum), but eventually got better just as Harry started to use them as soldiers for his war against Norman and Spider-Man.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #73.

===''Go Down Swinging''===
The apparent first step in this plan occurs with Osborn managing to steal the [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage symbiote]] from an abandoned S.H.I.E.L.D. storehouse while Spider-Man is occupied with the return of Zodiac.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #794. Marvel Comics.</ref> Osborn's efforts to control the Carnage symbiote initially backfire when he merges with it and finds himself overwhelmed by the urge to kill rather than his own prior plan to direct its power against Spider-Man specifically,<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #795. Marvel Comics.</ref> but he is able to convince it to let him have control in favor of trying something other than its usual mindless slaughter.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #796">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #796. Marvel Comics.</ref> While interrogating a captive Jameson for information on Spider-Man, Osborn takes a brief interval from the torture to kill the self-proclaimed Goblin King who tried to raid one of his old storehouses. After Osborn appeared as the Green Goblin, Jameson mentioned how he could not stop Spider-Man since even [[The Night Gwen Stacy Died|throwing Gwen off the bridge]] did not stop him from fighting back. Those words caused Norman to remember that Spider-Man is Peter Parker.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #797. Marvel Comics.</ref> Attacking the ''Daily Bugle'' in his familiar Goblin attire, Osborn gives the rest of the staff time to evacuate as he fights Peter before revealing his new bond with Carnage, proclaiming himself to be the '''Red Goblin''', driving Spider-Man away with 'Carnage bombs' that injure his leg. Discovering a sound-transmitting spider-tracer planted on him, Osborn uses this to deliver a 'devil's bargain' to Peter; if Peter abandons the Spider-Man identity and never performs any further heroics, Osborn will leave Parker alone, but the second he sees any sign of Spider-Man's return, he will kill everyone in Peter's life. Peter places the Spider-Man top on a flagpole so that Osborn can see it burn but privately vows that he will find a way to defeat Osborn as Peter rather than Spider-Man.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #798. Marvel Comics.</ref> Peter is able to contact various allies like [[Human Torch]], [[Clash (comics)|Clash]], [[Silk (comics)|Silk]], [[Miles Morales]], and Agent Anti-Venom to watch over his loved ones. When Norman moves against the Osborns and proves immune to Carnage's traditional weaknesses of Human Torch's fire and Clash's sound devices, Peter is forced to step back into action despite the injured leg, with Agent Anti-Venom sacrificing a chance to get back into action himself to heal Spider-Man's injury as Osborn merges a part of the Carnage symbiote with his grandson Normie turning into a miniature version of Red Goblin.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #799. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Normie goes after May but she gets some unexpected help in the form of Superior Octopus and J. Jonah Jameson who uses an old [[Spider-Slayer]], however, both are defeated by Norman. Soon afterward, Normie watches as his grandfather throws Liz through a window only to be rescued by Spider-Man which causes Normie to turn on Norman. Norman reveals to Spider-Man he infected some of Peter's friends and family with slivers of the Carnage symbiote which he could send to their brain to kill them. However, it turns out that Flash has figured out Spider-Man's secret identity too and went to May and Mary Jane in order to remove those ticking time bombs. Flash then takes the fight to Norman and while it appears as if he's gaining the upper hand, it turns out that Norman still has some Green Goblin tech beneath the Carnage symbiote and he uses that to electrocute Flash. Flash's injuries prove to be fatal and die in Spider-Man's arms. Spider-Man confronts Norman at [[Times Square]] as Red Goblin gains the upper hand. Peter manages to hold him off by pointing out that it's not the Goblin killing the Spider, but rather Carnage and [[Cletus Kasady]]. The villain is enraged by this and when Peter removes the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] symbiote and to challenge him, Norman takes off the Carnage symbiote to reveal his old Green Goblin persona. Spider-Man manages to take his foe down and when the villain begs the Carnage symbiote to help him, the wall-crawler seemingly destroys it by hitting it with an exploding gas tank. However, the Carnage symbiote was attached to Norman when Peter destroyed it, and he wonders what sort of effect that might have had on his old foe's mind. Norman is last seen incarcerated at [[Ravencroft]] and believes that Spider-Man is Osborn and he is Kasady.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #800. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Absolute Carnage===
When Kasady starts hunting all former symbiote hosts to extract the samples of the symbiote codex left in them with the goal of awakening a [[Knull (comics)|symbiote god]] as seen in the "[[Absolute Carnage]]" storyline, Spider-Man and Venom attempt to retrieve Osborn from Ravencroft to test a machine that can extract the codex from former hosts, as the [[Maker (Reed Richards)|Maker]] is uncertain of potential side-effects. However, Carnage attacks Ravencroft as they attempt to retrieve Osborn, transforming most of the patients into his drone soldiers and turning Osborn into another version of Carnage due to him still believing himself to be Kasady.<ref>''Absolute Carnage'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> As Spider-Man works to keep Normie Osborn and Dylan Brock safe, a flashback showed that [[Harry Osborn#Kindred|Kindred]] had visited Norman Osborn in Ravencroft. He quoted that Norman looked down on the citizens of New York from his tower and states that he could have his centipedes rip him apart if he wanted them to. Kindred even made a reference to how he appeared in Mary Jane's nightmares and how he would not be able to kill Spider-Man as Kindred states that he "already won a long time ago." Back in the present, Norman has defeated Spider-Man.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #30. Marvel Comics.</ref> In the rest of the flashback, Kindred sent one of his centipedes into Osborn's head in order to save him from himself. Back in the present, Osborn's Carnage form feels a scratching in his head as he tells Kindred to let him be the one to kill Spider-Man. He then turns his target towards Dylan Brock and Normie. Spider-Man gets to his feet and defeats Norman. As more of the flashback is shown, Kindred states to Norman that he will leave now and will return when Norman is himself again so that they can confront the truth together. As Kindred starts to leave, Norman's Kasady persona states to Kindred that he has a message for him from Norman who states that he is "so proud of him". Kindred takes his leave as Norman's Kasady breaks out in maniacal laughter.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #31. Marvel Comics.</ref> After the Grendel symbiote left Norman Osborn's body, Norman regained conscious and escaped during the final showdown with Carnage.<ref>''Absolute Carnage'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

At some point, Norman's mind recovered and he joined the Power Elite.<ref>''Free Comic Book Day'' 2018 #Avengers. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In the pages of "Ravencroft", Norman Osborn regained his sanity by blaming his actions on the Carnage symbiote to J.A.N.U.S. and became a consultant at Ravencroft at the behest of Mayor Wilson Fisk during its rebuilding. One of his assignments is to help John Jameson regain the ability to become Man-Wolf so that he can become an asset ranging from having [[Mister Hyde (comics)|Mister Hyde]] attack him to creating a clone of [[Ashley Kafka]]. In addition, Norman stole the Journal of Jonas Ravencroft to give to J.A.N.U.S. to use. When the Unwanted who lived beneath Ravencroft for years attacked, Norman succeeded in his goal to have John Jameson turn into Man-Wolf in order to fight the Unwanted. J.A.N.U.S.' leaders were pleased with Osborn's success enabling them to use the items in the basement.<ref>''Ravencroft'' #1-5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Sin Eater's resurrection and Last Remains===
{{Further|Sins Rising (comics)|Last Remains|Sinister War}}
During the "[[Sins Rising (comics)|Sins Rising]]" arc, Mayor Wilson Fisk promoted Norman Osborn to becoming the director of Ravencroft where he found himself being targeted by a resurrected [[Sin-Eater (comics)|Sin-Eater]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #46. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Sin-Eater's army of followers attacked Ravencroft, Norman was rescued by Spider-Man.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #48.

Norman reveals that he was planning to use the weapons to counter Kindred who is after both of them. This leads to Norman removing a fake wall containing Green Goblin weaponry ready for combat.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man: The Sins of Norman Osborn'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Using Juggernaut's powers, Sin-Eater and his followers pursue Spider-Man and Norman Osborn as the Order of the Web considers waiting for Sin-Eater to cleanse Norman Osborn before intervening. As Spider-Man and Norman Osborn escape underground, Sin-Eater catches up to them. As Spider-Man holds onto Sin-Eater to restrain him, Norman Osborn activates an EMP to liquefy the floor beneath them. After getting away, Norman tried to drown Spider-Man as he is saved by the Order of the Web. Upon identifying [[Spider-Woman (Gwen Stacy)|Ghost-Spider]] as an alternate version of Gwen Stacy and his plans to do what he did to the other Gwen Stacy, Spider-Man threw him out of the vehicle thery were in.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #49. Marvel Comics.</ref>

At the start of the "[[Last Remains]]" arc, Sin-Eater catches up to Norman Osborn and uses his gun to purge him of his sins. When Norman Osborn recovered, he was found by Kafka as most of Sin-Eater's followers are arrested. While mentioning that Ravencroft is in bad shape, Kafka is told by a remorseful Norman his suspicion that Kindred is Harry Osborn.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #50. Marvel Comics.</ref> Not wanting to give him to the police, Kafka brings Norman to her office where he confessed every bad thing that he has done in his life. When Norman still claims that Harry is Kindred and that he must find a way to stop him before he goes further down the path to vengeance, Kafka suggests to Norman that he should enlist someone who Harry would still listen to.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #50.LR. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref name="ReferenceA">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #52.LR.

He claims to Mary Jane that Harry Osborn is Kindred to which Mary Jane claimed that she just saw Harry Osborn alive.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> It turns out that Norman Osborn faked being purged of his sins as seen when he meets up with Mayor Wilson Fisk and his men. Norman and Mayor Fisk work on a plan to dispose of Kindred for what he did to them.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #54.LR. Marvel Comics.</ref> Norman Osborn contacts Mayor Wilson Fisk stating that Mary Jane Watson got through to Kindred. As Mary Jane offers her life in exchange for Kindred not killing the Order of the Web, Norman Osborn in his Green Goblin attire crashes the confrontation where he throws a Pumpkin Bomb near Mary Jane stating that the choice isn't Kindred's choice. Then Green Goblin gives Mayor Fisk the signal to activate the trap which causes the tomb to be engulfed by a supernatural darkness.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #55. Marvel Comics.</ref> Prior to the confrontation with Kindred, Norman Osborn spoke to Mayor Wilson Fisk about Project Blank which was inspired by the Darkforce Dome that Hydra used during their [[Secret Empire (comics)|takeover of the United States]]. They enlisted [[Spot (comics)|Spot]] to power it. Back in the present, Mary Jane revealed to Spider-Man that the Pumpkin Bomb that was thrown was a flash bomb version as Green Goblin secretly quotes to Spider-Man to evacuated his allies while wearing his mask so that Mayor Fisk won't know his true identity. At Ravencroft, Kindred's Darkforce casing is being kept together by magic while monitored by Ravencroft's staff. After some persuasion to Mayor Fisk, Norman Osborn speaks to Kindred while mentioned that he was actually cleansed by Sin-Eater while voicing regret having birthed the sickness in Harry's mind. Planning to redeem the Osborn name, Norman states to Kindred that he will find the truth that he talked about. Spider-Man arrives stating to Norman that he would like to talk to him.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #56. Marvel Comics.</ref> Spider-Man states to Norman Osborn that whenever he is cured or rebounds, somebody always dies. Norman agrees with the question and states that he wants Spider-Man to help him keep Kindred from being harmed by Mayor Wilson Fisk. When Norman continues to ask for Spider-Man and Mary Jane's help, Spider-Man beats him up and then walks out.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #57. Marvel Comics.</ref>

"[[Sinister War]]" arc reveals just like Peter Parker,<ref>''Vol. 1 Issue 537 - 545''</ref> after Civil War I, but before him, Norman was also a victim of a devil's deal with [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], and Osborn's descent into villainy is caused by his past deal with the latter, at the cost of original Harry's soul.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #72.

==Powers and abilities==
[[File:Green Goblin (Alex Ross's art).jpg|right|thumb|Norman Osborn as Green Goblin on the cover of ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #797 (March 2018 Marvel Comics). Art by [[Alex Ross]]]]

Norman Osborn was turned into the Green Goblin by a chemical solution he had devised based upon a formula originally conceived by Professor [[Mendel Stromm]]. The process granted Osborn superhuman strength, speed, reflexes, and stamina as well as a low-level rapid healing factor.<ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Stan Lee]] | Penciller = [[Steve Ditko]] | Inker = [[Steve Ditko]] | Story = Spider-Man | Title = The Amazing Spider-Man | Issue = #37 | Date = June 1966 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> In addition to these physical advantages, the serum also greatly enhanced Norman's already-above average intellect, making him a bona fide genius capable of making breakthroughs in advanced areas of [[genetics]], [[robotics]], [[engineering]], [[physics]] and [[applied chemistry]]. The goblin formula is also said to have driven Osborn insane; defects in his personality were strongly augmented by the serum, resulting in dangerous mood-swings and hallucinations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/5417454/the-top-10-wackiest-norman-osborn-weird-outs|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503060722/http://io9.gizmodo.com/5417454/the-top-10-wackiest-norman-osborn-weird-outs|title=The Top 10 Wackiest Norman Osborn Weird-Outs|date=December 3, 2009|archive-date=May 3, 2016|work=[[Io9]]|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Following his confrontation with the returned Spider-Man after his campaign against Otto Octavius in Spider-Man's body, Osborn has been rid of the Goblin formula from his system and thus has lost his superhuman abilities, forcing him to rely on his intellect and other natural abilities. Otto's anti-serum also prevents Osborn's attempts of restoring his powers; ultimately he seeks to rid himself of it in hopes of having them again despite risking his health and sanity.<ref name="Superior Spider-Man"/> Norman bonded to the Carnage symbiote to use to expel the anti-serum from his body which restores his former powers in the process, but once more at the cost of his mind. In addition, the Carnage symbiote eliminates his physical scars including his features'.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #796"/>

He has since claimed to have 'perfected' the formula so that it will grant the subjects powers while also reverting those he chooses to a more basic mentality where they will accept his orders.<ref name = "ASM-4-27"/>

===Weapons of Green Goblin===
{{Main|Green Goblin#Powers and abilities}}
The Green Goblin is armed with a variety of bizarre devices. He wears a green costume underneath bulletproof [[mail (armour)|chainmail]] with an overlapping purple tunic. His mask has a built-in gas filter to keep him safe from his own gasses. The Green Goblin's trademark weapons are his pumpkin bombs and razor bats. As their name suggests, the bombs were designed with the appearance of [[jack-o'-lantern]]s. These varied in function from smoke bombs to traditional explosives, while the razor edged [[bat]]-shaped [[boomerang]]s-could cut through very durable surfaces and materials. The gloves of the Goblin uniform were fashioned with minuscule conductors that allowed for the release of electricity at nearly 10,000 [[ampere|amps]] of an undetermined voltage. Originally, Osborn used a mechanical broomstick to fly through the air during his first few exploits as the Green Goblin. The Flying Broomstick did not last long, however, and was improved upon, creating the Goblin Glider. The Goblin Glider was a more efficient flight system than Norman's Flying Broomstick. The Glider allowed the Goblin to carry a wide array of armaments, including heat-seeking and smart missiles, machine guns, extending blades, a flamethrower and a pumpkin bomb dispenser/launcher with him as he flew and had much greater speed and mobility than the Broomstick.<ref name="GG">{{cite web | url=http://comicbooks.about.com/od/spiderman/p/greengoblinbio.htm | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424153033/http://comicbooks.about.com/od/spiderman/p/greengoblinbio.htm | title=Green Goblin Profile | publisher=About.com | archive-date=April 24, 2008 | author=Albert, Aaron | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}</ref>

===Weapons as Iron Patriot===
During the events of the "[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]" storyline, Osborn created the [[Iron Patriot]] identity (an amalgam of Iron Man and Captain America) to cement his standing as a hero. As the Iron Patriot, he utilized an outdated version of Iron Man's armor painted in Captain America's colors. The armor featured superhuman strength, enhanced durability, flight, magnetic impact blasts, heat seeking missiles, miniaturized lasers, flamethrowers, and a communications system housed in his helmet which allowed him to interface with any U.S.-controlled satellite or computer network. While Iron Man's armor utilized repulsor technology, Osborn's design does not; all but one repulsor was destroyed as "Oz is too stupid" to make his own repulsor-based weapons system. Osborn's star shaped Uni Beam projector on his chest (because of its shape) also has a less powerful output.<ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Dan Slott]] | Penciller = [[Adam Kubert]] | Inker = [[Mark Morales]] | Story = [[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]] | Title = Dark Reign: The List-Spider-Man | Issue = #1 | Date = November 2009 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>

===Powers as Super-Adaptoid===
Following his time in prison, [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M]] scientists converted Osborn into a [[Super-Adaptoid]], capable of absorbing the abilities of any mutant, mutate, alien, android or other such superpowered being by touching them. In this form he possessed considerably increased strength and durability; where he was once approximately as strong as Spider-Man, he now possessed sufficient strength to overpower and throw Luke Cage a significant distance away from him.<ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Brian Michael Bendis]] | Penciller = [[Daniel Acuña]] | Inker = [[Daniel Acuña]] | Story = [[Shattered Heroes]] | Title =The Avengers vol. 4 | Issue = #18 | Date = October 2011 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> He could also levitate, and he was able to defeat the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] in an aerial conflict between the two.<ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Brian Michael Bendis]] | Penciller = [[Daniel Acuña]] | Inker = [[Daniel Acuña]] | Story = [[Shattered Heroes]] | Title =The Avengers vol. 4 | Issue = #20 | Date = December 2011 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>

He is known to have absorbed the abilities of Luke Cage, Vision, [[Thunderbolt Ross|Red Hulk]] and Protector, and it is suggested that he also absorbed the abilities of his current Dark Avengers. In his final form, his body grew to the Hulk's size, and like Hulk he was capable of creating shockwaves by hitting the ground or smashing his hands together. His durability was sufficient to withstand the combined attacks of all the Avengers, and he demonstrated remarkable healing abilities, recovering in seconds after [[Daisy Johnson]] used her powers to make his heart explode. He could also turn intangible by manipulating his density, as the Vision does.<ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Brian Michael Bendis]] | Penciller = Renato Guedes | Inker = Jose Wilson Magalhaes | Story = Avengers | Title =The Avengers vol. 4 | Issue = #22 | Date = February 2012 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>

However, Osborn had no control over his Super-Adaptoid abilities; he would automatically absorb the powers of any superhuman he touched, even if he did not consciously want to. He was also limited in how many powers his body could hold, as the A.I.M. scientists warned him that absorbing too many powers at once could overload his systems. In the end, he inadvertently absorbed the abilities of all the Avengers and New Avengers when they all touched him at once, and the unstable combination of their multiple different powers caused significant damage to his body chemistry, resulting in him going into a [[coma]].<ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Brian Michael Bendis]] | Penciller = [[Daniel Acuña]] | Inker = [[Daniel Acuña]] | Story = Avengers | Title =The Avengers vol. 4 | Issue = #23 | Date = February 2012 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> After he regained consciousness, these powers were apparently burnt out, returning him to his Goblin-level strength instead.<ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Brian Michael Bendis]] | Penciller = [[Daniel Acuña]] | Inker = [[Daniel Acuña]] | Story = [[Shattered Heroes]] | Title =The Avengers vol. 4 | Issue = #24 | Date = March 2012 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>

===Powers as Red Goblin===
{{Main|Symbiote (comics)#Powers and abilities}}
After gaining control of the Carnage symbiote's desire for mindless slaughter, Osborn has used it to form a new attire in the form of the Red Goblin, which essentially resembles a red version of his Green Goblin outfit without the purple and green clothing, as well as a long tail and flaming breath.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #796</ref> With the symbiote, he can create his own Goblin Glider and what he terms 'Carnage bombs', which are essentially pumpkin bombs that can actually talk to and bite their targets before exploding, as well as the Carnage symbiote's traditional enhancements.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #798</ref> Due to the combination of the symbiote with the new Goblin formula injected into his system, Osborn is immune to the symbiote's traditional weaknesses of fire and sound, although the touch of Anti-Venom is still dangerous to him. He also revived its ability to spread its constituent matter to others.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #799</ref>

==Characterization==
Norman Osborn has consistently been depicted with several unusual weaknesses related to his psychosis and to his personality. He suffers from manic depression, has a pronounced narcissistic personality disorder co-morbid with severe anti-social psychopathic traits,<ref name="Thunderbolts #113">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Warren Ellis]] | Penciller = [[Mike Deodato]] | Inker = [[Mike Deodato]] | Story = The Initiative | Title = Thunderbolts | Issue = #113 | Date = June 2007 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> and in some depictions, a form of dissociative identity disorder (DID). For some of his early appearances, he and the Goblin were separate personalities; his Goblin side disdaining his human weaknesses, while his Norman Osborn persona was primarily motivated by his concern for Harry.<ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #96-98"/> Although the stress caused by his son's failing health as Norman helped to provoke his transformation back into the Goblin,<ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Gerry Conway]] | Penciller = [[Gil Kane]] | Inker = [[John Romita Sr.]] | Story = [[The Night Gwen Stacy Died]] | Title = The Amazing Spider-Man | Issue = #121 | Date = June 1973 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> this supposedly separate and more compassionate side of him never reappeared after he was believed dead. Norman is also highly sadistic, showing a complete lack of empathy for the lives of innocent people who stand between him and his objectives. These weaknesses have often been referenced in stories featuring him and exploited by his enemies.<ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Gerry Conway]] | Penciller = [[Sal Buscema]] | Inker = [[Mike Esposito (comics)|Mike Esposito]] | Story = Spider-Man | Title = Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man | Issue = #2 | Date = January 1977 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>

Norman Osborn is shown to be severely manic depressive.<ref name="Thunderbolts #113"/> This has been referenced several times in a myriad of Spider-Man stories. When he is not under the direction of a psychiatrist and taking medication, he has dangerous mood swings.<ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Stan Lee]] | Penciller = [[John Romita Sr.]] | Inker = [[Mike Esposito (comics)|Mike Esposito]] | Story = Spider-Man | Title = The Amazing Spider-Man | Issue = #62 | Date = July 1968 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> At the apex of his mania, he is paranoid, delusional, and suffers from visual and auditory hallucinations, including hearing the voice of his Green Goblin persona and seeing its face in the mirror rather than his own.<ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Glenn Greenberg]] | Penciller = [[Kyle Hotz]] | Inker = Jerome Moore, [[Kyle Hotz]], [[Al Milgrom]] | Story = [[Clone Saga]] | Title = The Osborn Journal | Issue = #1 | Date = February 1997 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> Previously, Osborn's arrogance caused him to refuse to submit to psychiatric treatment unless forced to; he viewed mental illness as an imperfection and therefore would not admit that he is mentally ill.<ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Stan Lee]] | Penciller = [[John Romita Sr.]] | Inker = [[Mike Esposito (comics)|Mike Esposito]] | Story = Spider-Man | Title = The Amazing Spider-Man | Issue = #63 | Date = August 1968 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> In later conversations with the Sentry, Osborn revealed that he had come to accept his own mental illness.<ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Brian Michael Bendis]] | Penciller = [[Mike Deodato]] | Inker = [[Mike Deodato]] | Story = [[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]] | Title = Dark Avengers | Issue = #3 | Date = May 2009 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> After having rid of his powers after the confrontation with the Superior Spider-Man (Doctor Octopus), Osborn's sanity apparently restored but remains a villain.<ref name="Superior Spider-Man">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Dan Slott]], [[Christos Gage]] | Penciller = [[Giuseppe Camuncoli]] | Inker = John Dell, Terry Pallot | Story = [[The Superior Spider-Man]] | Title = Goblin Nation | Issue = #31 | Date = April 2014 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>

Superhuman [[psychiatrist]] [[Doc Samson|Leonard Samson]] says of Osborn: "In clinical terms, the words psychotic and psychopathic are far from synonymous... but in Norman Osborn's case, both apply. I'd characterise him as a bipolar psychotic with concurrent aspects of psychopathic megalomania and malignant narcissism. In layman's terms, a lethal cocktail of intersecting personality disorders that makes him one of the most dangerous human beings on the planet".<ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Andy Diggle]] | Penciller = Roberto de la Torre | Inker = Roberto de la Torre | Story = [[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]] | Title = Thunderbolts | Issue = #128 | Date = March 2009 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> There are many examples of Osborn's pronounced superiority complex, to the point that he will rarely, if ever, admit that he has made mistakes. He often transfers blame for his shortcomings to others or claims that he was better than he was; even before his accident, he spent more time providing Harry with gifts or outings rather than actually being there for his son or trying to listen to his problems, and nevertheless claims that he was still a good father, likely due to the abusive nature of his own father.

Having become the Goblin, he generally views other people as dim-witted pests, lacking in creative vision, unworthy to be graced by his presence. He goes out of his way to remind others of their personal failures and shortcomings and to remind those in close relationships with him, such as his son, that they are incapable of measuring up to his achievements. When he first learned Spider-Man's identity, he claimed that, when Spider-Man had defeated him in their previous battles, none of those victories counted because Spider-Man had only beaten his lackeys, or been rescued by the intervention of other super powered beings such as the [[Human Torch]], despite the fact that he always departed the battles after Spider-Man's victories rather than trying to defeat his foe himself.<ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Stan Lee]] | Penciller = [[John Romita Sr.]] | Inker = [[Mike Esposito (comics)|Mike Esposito]] | Story = Spider-Man | Title = The Amazing Spider-Man | Issue = #40 | Date = September 1966 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>

He also missed the opportunity to lead the original [[Sinister Six]] because he felt that joining the group would mean admitting he needed the help of others to rid himself of Spider-Man.<ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Stan Lee]] | Penciller = [[Steve Ditko]] | Inker = [[Steve Ditko]] | Story = Spider-Man | Title = The Amazing Spider-Man Annual | Issue = #1 | Date = October 1964 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> Although he later formed the 'Sinister Twelve' when Spider-Man sent him to prison, he expressed anger at Mac Gargan for acquiring the Venom symbiote rather than using the new Scorpion suit provided for him simply because Gargan was not doing what he wanted, despite Venom being more powerful than the Scorpion.<ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Mark Millar]] | Penciller = [[Terry Dodson]] | Inker = [[Rachel Dodson]] | Story = [[Marvel Knights]] | Title = Marvel Knights: Spider-Man | Issue = #11 | Date = April 2005 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> When he participated in the mystical ritual known as the Gathering of Five, he appeared convinced that he would automatically receive the gift of power from the ritual&nbsp;– which would bestow upon the participants power, immortality, knowledge, madness and death, respectively&nbsp;– only to receive the gift of madness instead,<ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Stan Lee]] | Penciller = [[Gil Kane]] | Inker = [[Frank Giacoia]], Tony Mortellaro | Story = Spider-Man | Title = The Amazing Spider-Man | Issue = #98 | Date = July 1971 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> subsequently requiring an elaborate cocktail of drugs to restore himself to a semblance of sanity.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Roger Stern]]|artist=[[Ron Frenz]]|story=Spider-Man|title=Revenge of the Green Goblin|issue= 1|date=December 2000|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref> During his time in charge of H.A.M.M.E.R. he was provoked into attacking Asgard by his Goblin side because his ego couldn't allow himself to consider the possibility that the [[Asgardians (Marvel Universe)|Asgardians]] ''wouldn't'' threaten his power.<ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Brian Michael Bendis]] | Penciller = [[Michael Lark]] | Inker = Stefano Gaudiano | Story = [[Siege (comics)|Siege]] | Title = Siege: The Cabal | Issue = #1 | Date = December 2009 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> Later events revealed that Loki at least slightly influenced Osborn's decision to further Loki's own goals.<ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Kieron Gillen]] | Penciller = [[Jamie McKelvie]] | Inker = [[Jamie McKelvie]] | Story = [[Siege (comics)|Siege]] | Title = Siege: Loki | Issue = #1 | Date = April 2010 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref><ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Brian Michael Bendis]] | Penciller = [[Olivier Coipel]] | Inker = [[Mark Morales]] | Story = [[Siege (comics)|Siege]] | Title = Siege | Issue = #4 | Date = May 2010 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> During his attempted takeover of Earth's superhuman security defenses, he was shown reflecting that humans are all barbarians who require the strong like him to control them, dismissing the Avengers as no better than him despite the obvious distinction between Osborn's demands for power and the straightforward respect that the general public have for the Avengers.<ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Brian Michael Bendis]] | Penciller = Renato Guedes | Inker = Jose Wilson Magalhaes | Story = Avengers | Title =The Avengers vol. 4 | Issue = #24 | Date = Mar 2012 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>

It has been shown that since having suppressed the rampaging Green Goblin personality and becoming the more dominant personality, Osborn has proven to be just as (if not more) evil and cruel. Osborn has demonstrated a high degree of sadism: while in prison, a guard once asked him for his advice in helping his critically ill wife; Osborn's advice led her to a quicker and more agonizing death.<ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Andy Diggle]] | Penciller = [[Tom Raney]] | Inker = Scott Hanna | Story = [[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]] | Title = Dark Reign: Hawkeye | Issue = #1 | Date = June 2009 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> As director of [[H.A.M.M.E.R.]], he directed his officers to shoot down an airplane full of innocent people just to see whether his enemy [[Pepper Potts]] was powerful enough to rescue the passengers with her Rescue armor.<ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Matt Fraction]] | Penciller = [[Salvador Larroca]] | Inker = Salvador Larroca | Story = [[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]] | Title = Invincible Iron-Man | Issue = #11–12 | Date = May 2009 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> His Goblin persona vied for control of his body, as depicted in the January 2010 issue of ''[[Dark Avengers]]'', where he is shown writhing on the floor and imploring, apparently to himself, "Why won't this face come off...?", and finally took over when Osborn's Iron Patriot armor was defeated by Captain America and Iron Man at the end of the "[[Siege (comics)|Siege]]" arc.<ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Brian Michael Bendis]] | Penciller = [[Olivier Coipel]] | Inker = Mark Morales | Story = [[Siege (comics)|Siege]] | Title = Siege | Issue = #3 | Date = March 2010 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> Since being cured of the Goblin formula, Osborn claims that his sanity has also been restored. However, he has expressed satisfaction at plastic surgery that 'restored' him to a twisted version of his original features, and intended to use a modified version of the formula to essentially 'infect' the entire country of Symkaria to become goblin-level soldiers without the intellectual capacity to defy him.<ref name = "ASM-4-27"/>

===1602===
In the ''[[Marvel: 1602]]'' Pocket Universe, [[Norman Osborne]] appears as a major villain, attempting to find "the Source", which is guarded by the Natives of [[Roanoke Island]], and utilize it to gain unimaginable power; to achieve his goal, Osborne allies with [[James I of England|King James I of England]] and makes several attempts to create conflict between his fellow American colonists and the Natives. Ultimately, Osborne is captured and imprisoned in [[stocks]] after peace between the colonists and Natives resumes and the English are forced from America.<ref>''Marvel 1602: New World'' #1-5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In ''Spider-Man: 1602'', Osborne has been released from the stocks, and is now harbourmaster of Roanoke. When [[Alternative versions of Spider-Man#1602|Peter Parquagh]] and [[Virginia Dare]] find evidence he is plotting against the natives again, he kills Virginia and exposes Peter's secret identity as The Spider. He is sentenced to be sent back to England, where capital punishment is still practiced. When the ''[[Mayflower]]'' is attacked by the pirate [[Kingpin (character)|Wilson Fisk]], Osborne's cell is hit by a cannonball. Covered in gangrenous wounds, his sentence is abandoned since he is not expected to live long enough to stand trial in England. He contacts the natural philosopher [[Hank Pym|Henri Le Pym]], asking to be cured in return for helping Pym acquire some of Peter's blood for his experiments.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

Le Pym's attempts to cure Osborne mutate him into a winged, green-skinned creature, and he uses these powers to capture Parquagh. During his final battle with Parquagh (in which Osborne uses exploding spherical vials as projectiles in combat) he is killed by a crossbow bolt fired by Fisk's first mate, the [[Bullseye (comics)|Bull's Eye]], who has also been hunting Parquagh.<ref>''Spider-Man 1602'' #1-5.

He is partially responsible for the deaths of the Avengers as he sent them to battle a now Super Intelligent Absorbing Man. The Enforcers and The Vulture seem to serve as his secret service. He is later used as a pawn for the [[Red Skull]], until Spiders Man makes him think he's with Gwen Stacy (in reality the Red Skull) who shoves him out the window where his foot catches on a flag and his neck snaps similar to how Gwen died. Unaware of the irony, Skull orders his corpse be brought back up so he can push him out again, just so he can make a "splat" sound.<ref>''Earth X'' #0. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''Earth X'' #9.

===Marvel Noir===
In the [[Marvel Noir]] universe, Norman Osborn is a former circus freak who was mistreated by the audience for his reptile-like skin disorder. This fueled his ambitions in earning his "respect" by becoming the major Crime Lord in New York. He used a mask to hide his true appearance. Earning the name "'''the Goblin'''", he organized his group composing of former circus and carnival freak shows: [[Kraven the Hunter]], Adrian Toomes, and [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]].

The Goblin's reputation earned him as a freelancer from among New York City's politicians and businessmen in hired to commit illegal acts such as suppressing public protests and even acts of assassinations on public objectors. These actions eventually caused him to come into conflict with Spider-Man after he order The Vulture to kill the vigilante's [[Uncle Ben|uncle]]. Later, reporter [[Ben Urich]] became a problem for Norman, so the mob boss sent The Chameleon dressed as [[J. Jonah Jameson]] to kill him as Osborn kidnapped the real one.

However, [[Harry Osborn]], who is still alive in this reality, manages to obtain the clone pod and releases Norman. This clone is quite sane due to never being exposed to the goblin formula, and he makes repeated efforts to convince his insane son to stop his maniacal plans. He ultimately sacrifices himself to save the Parkers and baby May from Harry, who swears vengeance.<ref>''Spider-Man: Clone Saga'' #1-5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Spider-Man: Life Story===
[[Spider-Man: Life Story]] features an alternate continuity where the characters naturally age when Peter debuted as Spider-Man in 1962. In 1966, Osborn loses his memories as the Green Goblin shortly after a fight with Spider-Man. While initially fearful of Osborn getting his memory back and revealing his secret identity, Peter later gives an anonymous tip to the police to get Osborn arrested and prevent the Green Goblin from hurting anyone.

In 1977, the still imprisoned Norman convinces Harry to suit up as the Black Goblin to steal "The Gemini Project" from Miles Warren, which is revealed to be a clone of himself. Harry discovers that Miles also cloned Peter and Gwen Stacy and deduces that Norman cloned Peter because he still considered Peter the more worthy heir. After Peter convinces Harry of his father's manipulations, Harry blows up the containment tubes the clones were in, killing all of them except for Peter's clone. However, Miles reveals that the Gwen in the containment tube was actually the real Gwen.

Norman is eventually released from prison and feigns his old age affecting his mental state before disappearing from the public. In 1995, he reveals Spider-Man's secret identity and information about his clone Ben Reilly to Doctor Octopus, who kidnaps them and threatens Harry into using Oscorp technology to study a way to clone himself. In the process, he discovers that Peter is supposedly the clone while Ben is the original. In the ensuing chaos, Doctor Octopus kills Harry after attempting to kill Peter and Ben. Peter allows Ben to take over his life in New York before tracking down Norman to an industrial area in New Jersey with [[Jessica Jones]]' help. Peter reveals he kept tabs on Norman after he was released from prison and knew Norman rigged the machines to trick Peter into thinking he was the clone. After learning of Harry's death from Peter, Norman blames Peter for the incident and tries to attack him, but then dies of a heart attack cursing Spider-Man.<ref>''Spider-Man: Life Story'' #1-4.

===Ultimate Marvel===
{{Main|Green Goblin (Ultimate Marvel character)}}
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of Norman Osborn is a corrupt [[industrialist]] and [[scientist]] who is trying to perfect the [[Supersoldier|Super Soldier]] drug for [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], an obsession that leads to the neglect of his wife [[Emily Osborn|Martha Osborn]] and son [[Harry Osborn]]. When an [[OZ (Ultimate Marvel)|OZ]]-injected spider bites [[Spider-Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Peter Parker]] on a field trip,<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> and develops amazing abilities, Norman theorizes that if the OZ combined with spider DNA were behind Parker's abilities of a spider, then Norman with OZ combined with his ''own'' DNA would become a heightened version of himself. But his experiment goes wrong,<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> and he himself is transformed into a [[Green Goblin|muscular, grotesque, goblin-looking monster]], granting him superhuman strength, reflexes, stamina, speed and durability, and enabling him to leap great distances. He is also pyrokinetic, as he can throw flaming balls of destructive energy. His alter-ego is later referred to as the "Green Goblin" by the public.

===What If?===
Norman Osborn has been featured in some "[[What If (comics)|What If]]" stories:

* In a story that asks "What If Spider-Man Saved Gwen Stacy", Spider-Man jumped after Gwen Stacy when Green Goblin threw her off the Washington Bridge enabling Norman Osborn to leak Spider-Man's identity to the Daily Bugle.<ref>''What If?'' #24. Marvel Comics.</ref>
* In a story that asks "What If Captain America Led All the Heroes Against the Superhero Registration Act", Green Goblin was among the villains that attacked the Sentinel O.N.E. Strikeforce. He was defeated by Captain America's group and was later attacked by Code Lightning (an army of Thor clones).<ref>''What If: Civil War'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>
* In an alternate reality, Osborn acquired the [[Infinity Gems]] after manipulating an army of villains to do the work for him and used them to reassemble the Infinity Gauntlet, defeating most of the heroes while trapping Spider-Man in a time loop where he witnesses/"causes" Gwen Stacy's death over and over again. However, when Norman uses the Gauntlet's power to resurrect his abusive father to show him what he has accomplished, his father dismisses him as a petty tyrant and a monster until Norman uses the Gauntlet to change his father's opinion. When [[Thanos]] appears, killing the rest of the Dark Avengers while taunting Osborn about the hollow nature of his father's current approval, Osborn destroys him, but when his altered father only says that he loves Norman as a son, Osborn erases him in a fit of anger as he wanted to be praised for his accomplishments, realizing too late that erasing his father automatically erases him as well.<ref>''What If? Infinity - Dark Reign'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===What The--?!===
In [[Spider-Ham|Peter Porker the Spectacular Spider-Ham]], Norman Osborn is a turkey and enemy to Spider-Ham calling himself the Green Gobbler.
