Who?  Pass it to me, Cartman? Cartman, stop hogging the goddamned ball! Oh, hey Dad. Aw, he's all right, Dad. He was just trying to warn us about ManBearPig. He could be half bear, half manpig. But I feel kind of bad for him, Dad. I don't think he has any friends. Hello?  Oh man... Hi Mr. Gore. I know. Eh look, I'm sorry but, we're all kind of busy. No, no, it's not that. Ih it's okay, Mr. Gore, I, I believe you. Yeah, I'm sure ManBearPig needs to be stopped. I'm just... I'm just scared that I can't do anything to stop him. ...Yes, I'm serial. Come on, you guys, Al Gore doesn't have any friends. We'll just make an appearance at his little meeting and then we'll go.  Yyeah, you know, Mr. Gore, uh, my dad's a geologist, and he said that ManBearPig probably isn't in Colorado. NO. Well, this was a great meeting. Wasn't it, guys? But, we gotta get goin' to school now. Mr. Gore, I I think we should stay with the tour group. Oh no! Help! Help!  Me?? Maybe there's another way out of here.  Cartman's right. First rule of survival is stay put and wait to be rescued. I'm sooo hungry. Do you think people even know we're here? Let's just try to sleep. Maybe help will come tomorrow. Dude, he's really sick.   Huh? What? Have they come for us? Oh my God.  Cartman? Dude, can you hear me? How, dude? We c- we don't even know if that passage I found goes anywhere. Goddamnit, he's soo heavy! Cartman?  I can't keep carrying him, dude! I've got no strength! Kenny! Here, take my hand!  Hurry Kyle, the water's rising! Kyle! No! Agh. Just stay away from us, asshole! I was nice to you because I felt sorry for you, because you don't have any friends! But now I see WHY you don't have any friends! You just used ManBearPig as a way to get attention for yourself because you're a LOSER!! Cartman, seriously, you need to see a doctor.
