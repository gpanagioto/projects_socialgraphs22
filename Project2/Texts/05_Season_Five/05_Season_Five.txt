<i>[joining the two other boys]</i> Hey you guys! Look what I have! Four tickets to ''The Lion King'' on stage! Aww, come on, you guys! It's supposed to be really cool. What, doughboy? What? What?! Goddamnit, Cartman! What are they gonna say on ''Cop Drama''?  They're gonna say "shit" on television? Bu- but I got these tickets to see ''Lion King'' on stage. It's just a marketing ploy by the network. Like that time they had the first male-to-male kiss with Terrance and Phillip? It's stupid! No, I don't have sand in my vagina! I just think it's a little immature for us to be standing around talking about one dumb word being on TV! Hey, Butters!  YOU before anybody else. How many ways are there to take it?! It's just a stupid word!  I'm going to the kitchen! This is stupid! I don't really give a fuck!  Well! I hope it lived up to all the hype! You must feel ''so'' much better now! Do you really think anything's gonna be any different now?!  What the hell? Oh, whatever.  This is ridiculous! Just because they say it on TV it's alright.  It's not new!! I'm gonna look "shit" up in the encyclopedia and prove it!! There's no sand in my vagina!!! You guys! You guys! I've looked up the word, "shit"! I think it might have something to do with people dying! Haven't you noticed everyone getting sick? It all started when they said "shit" on television. I am ''not'' full of meecro- what? Look, the word "shit" first showed up in English in the 1340s, the same time as something called, "The Black Death". Look! It ''might'' be a coincidence, but I think we'd better ask someone. Come on!  Chef, do you know where "shit" comes from?  No no! The ''word'', "shit". Ungh, it said in my book that the word, "shit", started exactly the same time as something called, "The Black Death". Right. But in the 1340s people in England stopped calling it "skite" and started calling it "shit." The same year as the Black Plague. A... curse word. Cartman, this is serious!!! Dude, this plague is spreading like wildfire!  We've gotta do something, Chef. If we don't we don't stop that network,  "shit" will become an even ''more'' acceptable word! Cartman, stop being an asshole!  We think that you might have caused it by helping make "shit" an everyday word.  It's true. We think that word might be plaguing our friend, Kenny. ...No. Now what? We need some help identifying an ancient English stone. And asshole. Wait!  It's okay. The curse has been lifted.  You see, we've learned something today. Swearing can be fun, but doing it all the time causes a lot of problems. We're all saying the S-word too much!  The knights of Standards and Practices were created to make sure that bad words were kept to a minimum. "Curse words" They're called that because they ''are a curse''. We have to go back to only using curse words in rare, extreme circumstances. That's pretty cool, dude! He's a magician named David Blaine, dude. He kicks ass. Wow, that's cool! Damn. That guy is the coolest guy in the universe! "David Blaine Workshop. Learn all about David Blaine at the Center for Magic." Dude, we gotta go.  I'm not really happy.  My potential hasn't even been reached.  Mom. Mom. I found out all about this great new magician named David Blaine. We spent all afternoon learning about how we aren't actually happy. I had no idea how unhappy I was until today. They gave me this cool book to read, and I'm already on chapter four.... So can I go to the Magic Camp, to learn how to become a full member? All the other guys are doin' it, and it's only $69.95.  You're Stan? Where's Kenny? I'm Kyle.  What do you mean? We're learning all kinds of cool stuff. But David Blaine is gonna do more miracles in Denver tomorrow. What are we doing? Whoa whoa, I'm not going anywhere. It's ''not'' stupid, Stan. For once in my life I feel like I'm part of something. Don't call Mr. Blaine a gaywad! He's a brilliant man. I'm not going anywhere! Huh? I thought you wanted to leave. You're Stan. Then I guess... I'm a dumbass.  Well, this is what I believe in now, Stan. And if you can't respect that,... then I guess we're not best friends anymore.  Hello, ma'am. My name is Kyle. And this is Cartman. We'd like to share our interest in David Blaine with you. That's right. ...And if you look here, you can see how David Blaine performed the miracle of being frozen in ice at Times Square. David Blaine is doing a big performance in Denver tomorrow night.  We're sure his magic will entertain and astound you! How many tickets can we put you down for? Great! That's 15 people we got to agree to come see David Blaine perform in Denver. I think if we try Kenny's neighborhood, we might find a-  This is a really good turnout. Dude, no way!  Congratulations, sister. You have heard the noble truth and are now a Blaintologist. Yeah. Why is ''that'' good news? Mass suicide?  Cartman! Cartman, wake up! Cartman! It's just me. Dude. I don't think I wanna be a part of this anymore. I think Stan might've been right. Anyway, I think it's going too far. I mean, if I kill myself, it's gonna make my family really sad. I think we should bail. If we leave the group, maybe other people will get the courage to leave, too. Okay. Okay, you're right.  What have you done, Cartman?!  Cartman, you fatass tattle-tale! Cartman! We've been brainwashed, don't you see? We don't have to do this! Cartman, no!  You bastards!  Stan! I don't want to kill myself. They rigged this thing to fill with water!  Wagh.  Thanks for saving us Stan. You're ''my'' Super Best Friend.  Haha, hehahaha. What the hell are you so happy about, fatass?  ...What the hell are you talking about? What's "pubes"? Oh.  No you didn't!   Scott Tenorman? The ninth grader? Cartman, you don't ''buy'' pubes, you grow them yourself! Yuh huh! Because, retard, you're dumb enough to ''buy'' Scott Tenorman's pubes for ten dollars! Yeah. Cartman, can I give you some advice? Just let it go, dude. You only had sixteen dollars and twelve cents. Count all your losses and move on. He's smarter than you. One please. Scott Tenorman is an eighth grader who sold Cartman his pubes for ten dollars, and now Cartman's all pissed off. What's in it for us? Okay, Cartman, what do you want?  Oh, Jesus! Okay, so what's the plan? ...What? You're such a dumbass, Cartman.   Scott Tenorman? We just wanna warn you: Eric Cartman, the fourth grader, is going' to try and trick you somehow into getting your wiener bitten off by a pony who lives at Denkins' ranch. 'Cause, we're his friends. 'Cause we hate him. Well, we just thought we'd let you know. See ya. Oho, we will. Trust us. We won't miss this.  Yeah, sure.  Dude, I think it might be best for us to never piss Cartman off again. Okay, dude, it's 3:30.  Yeah, fatass, this is their famous Mechanic sketch. Oh my God! Write the number down! Write the number down!! I got 'em! Four tickets, 68th row, to Terrance and Phillip! I waited in line since 3 this morning! What?? Well we got tickets to see Terrance and Phillip Live in Denver tomorrow night. We paid forty bucks apiece for them.  Uhuh, but that's why we're going. See, w-we're the official presidents of the Terrance and Phillip Fan Club. A- and... we're... going to see them tomorrow 'cause we can get them to perform at the Earth Day festival.  Heheh, heh, no problem, heh. No problem! Wow, dude, Terrance got really fat. Dude, what the hell is going on?! Why did they replace Phillip? We have to talk to Terrance. Hey! Look at that line!  It's way shorter. Well, maybe we can sneak in over there. Come on.  Nuh, it's more important than that. Our school is putting on a big show for Earth Day, and we promised people we could get you to perform. Phillip, your partner. But the guy who replaced him sucks!  But we promised the Earth Day people you'd perform. Uuuh, we didn't get them. Look, we could we could probably get Terrance, but he'll be performing with this other guy. Well, guys, I guess we're going to Canada. Ah, look, Phillip. Everyone in South Park just wants to see your serious side. They told us that "Phillip. He's the one with talent. Just get ''him'' for Earth Day." I didn't see he wouldn't be there, either. Look, all we have to do is get them there, right? Once Terrance and Phillip get together again, it'll be like old times.  Ih-it'll be okay. They said they'd come. He's here!  Uhhh-woo wow! Isn't this great? You guys seeing each other again? Please, you guys. This is for Earth Day.  You care about Mother Earth, don't you? See? I told you it would work.  You can't leave! The show starts soon! You bastards! Hooray for the earth! We must protect it.  Eh it's "Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow." I taped it last month. Jesus, man, those Earth Day people don't screw around! I didn't see you complaining at the time, fat boy! Haaah!  Wait! dude, LOOK!  "No, please! I promise I'll never make another album or movie!" "Have mercy!"  Yeah ha ha! Nuh uh. What the hell are you doing, fatass?! Kenny ''wasn't'' lying. Your grandma left it to you! You didn't earn it! No... No, this isn't possible. No, I mean, this is impossible, Stan! Cartman is the biggest asshole in the world! How is it that God gives him a million dollars? Why? How could you do this? There are people starving in Alabama and... and you give Cartman a million dollars?  Do you know what happened to me this morning, Stan? This morning... I woke up and felt a sharp pain in my ass. I felt down there and, and found this... big sore lump. On my ass, Stan. I couldn't even sit down, so... I, I had to tell my mother, which, which was humiliating. She took me to the doctor, which was more humiliating, a- a- nd he told me. I-I have a hemorrhoid. It's like an infected blood vessel on your ass. I'm nine years old, and I have a hemorrhoid, Stan. I have a hemorrhoid, and, Cartman has his own theme park.  Great.  It's my seat ring. I have to sit on it because of my hemorrhoid.  Ow. So, how are things going at Cartman's theme park?! Hunh, I guess you're right. Where are we going?  Owie-ow! Help! Ow, that hurts! Hohohooho! Oowwww!  Hoh Gohod, I popped it!! Oh hit huhurts!! Oh God, get me off of here!!   Stan, I have to go home!! I need my cream!! I need my creeheam!! My life can't get any worse! Lucky.  Oh, I'm swell, Stan. I popped my hemorrhoid trying to climb the fence into Cartmanland, and it got infected. I really need to go to the bathroom, but if I do, it will pop again and the pain will make me pass out. How are you? But it's okay, Stan, because I finally figured it out. You see, if someone like Cartman can get a million dollars and his own theme park, then there is no God. There's no God, dude. Why? Why, Mom? Because if I do something bad will happen to me? Because if I do your God might not shower me with his blessings of infected hemorrhoids? No! I finally do understand! There ''is'' no justice! There ''is'' no God! Do you hear me?! I renounce my faith!! Agh!   I've had enough of the Bible. What has it gotten me?  Satan talked to God?  And that's it? That's the end? That's the most horrible story I've ever heard. Why would God do such a horrible thing to a good person just to prove a point to Satan? Then I was right. Job has all his children killed, and Michael Bay gets to keep making movies. There isn't a God. Oh... Oohh—Ohuhughughhh...   Huh?  Huh? You ''are'' up there!   "No, no, please! This time I ''swear'' I won't make albums or movies."  "Oh God it burns! It bur-huhurns!" "AAAAAAAH!"  What's this all about, Kenny? No they don't! That's awesome! You "beat off?" Yeah... Chef, what's "laid"? Hey! Maybe we should ask the girls what ''they'' learned in sex ed. What the hell is wrong with them?  No. Nuh uh. Is that what you learned in sex ed? Oh my God, dude. Yeah. Quick! Well why not? You want us to get AIDS? Oh, jeez, we're gonna have to buy ''tons'' of these things. Uh, what are "studzes" It says you gotta check it for holes or tears. Sure. Yeah. I've changed mine three times already 'cause it itches so much. You mean, intercourse with a girl? Well that does it! If us boys are going to live, we have to get rid of the girls! Yeah! ''You'' get out of town!  Man, he's pretty good. Seventeen?  HA! I killed you! Hey Cartman! We're almost to level 20! You giving birth in there, or what? Hyeah, that poor, poor thing Well, why did you pull it out of the trash? Yeah, what it is, Mrs. Marsh? Cool! Dude, it's got a hundred twenty eight gigahertz D-RAM. Don't know, but it kicks ass.  Wow, dude, you're the luckiest kid in South Park. Awesome!  Oh, crap. I'm supposed to go to the lake with my family tomorrow and swim and play in the stupid sun. I know, I know. Well, look: I'll stay over anyway so I can play for... eighteen hours, and then I'll go to the lake.  Thanks, Towelie. Anyway, that will give me plenty of time playing video games. Okay, turn it on. Oh, this is so cool. Yeahyeah, Mom. I-I can't go to the lake. No, S-stan's having emotional problems and I need to help see him through it. He's got-  wha-what is it? Date-rape something. Yeah. Okay. I will. Okay, thanks, Mon.  I don't have to go outside! She said it's fine, but that I still ''have'' to go to baseball practice tonight.. Uh no. No we don't wanna get high! Me too. Yeah, real life is so boring and stupid. What? You mean Towelie?  Come on, hurry. I bet we can get to level 29!  Where is it? Where the hell is it?? What?  Uh-uh-uh what do you mean "they've taken it"? Oh, this isn't happening! This isn't happening!! Where the hell is he? What has this world come to? Where people can just... take your Okama GameSphere. That's a towel call? Hey, wait a minute. Towelie always showed up to give us towel advice when we'd said something about water. There he is! Just come on! It's getting dark. Are you sure this is where they said to be? Agh! Look, dude, we're on level 24, about to cross into the Caverns of Madness! Aw, God-damnit! Are we getting close? How long has it been since you've been back there. The base where you're from and where our Okama GameSphere is!  That's it!  You're not getting high again until we have our Okama GameSphere back! I don't care! You'd better remember where your base is! We're missing out on some quality video game time right now. All we wanna know is, who has our Okama GameSphere? Who's they? Okay. Dude, I figured it out. If we can go in, and get the GameSphere in 30 minutes, we could still be back at your house playing video games by midnight! Seven and a half. That's it? Well let's look in here.  What terrifying secret? And we don't care. Go ahead.  Photon rifle, whatever.  Our GameSphere!  Sweet!   I've almost got it! I got it!  Awesome! Check it out: Now we're going into the secret underground base. ...Remember when life used to be simple and cool? These are ''gas'' masks, Butters! Yeah, you can't get it if you don't breathe.  Dude, what's going on? Well what are we supposed to do with it? Dude, my mom won't even let me have a hamster. Uh oh, they're closing! Yeah.  Stan, I don't think we're supposed to be in the military base. They might shoot us.  Hey, wait! There are children in here!  Oh God, it was horrible! Cartman farted in there! We had to breath it in for ''20 hours!'' You sonofabitch, Cartman!  Dude, no wonder terrorists come from places like this! If I grew up here, I'd be pissed off, too! Is this the right house? Hey! What the hell are you doing?! Then why did you send us the goat? Jawas? Well, we tried, dude. If anyone else in this craphole hates Americans, we'd better just leave the goat and get back to the plane! Um...  Well boys, it's aboot time we get to our hoose in Canada, isn't it? Good job, fatass! Oh crap, it's him! But I thought you hate us. Cartman, where are you going?? Cartman, he's crazy! Where do we go?  All right, I've had just about enough of this! They told us in school, and on TV, that most people in Pakistan and Afghanistan ''like'' America. Do you really think your civilization is better than ours?! You people play games by killing animals, and oppress women! Wow! I guess Cartman really did take care of them. Yeah. I'm confused.  Dude! I almost thought those Afghani kids talked you into not liking America. Yeah.  I hate picture day at school! It's always some gay-ass photographer with some gay-ass backdrop of New England! No. This is taking forever. What, Cartman? It isn't that funny, Cartman. But I never take off my hat. This ''is'' how I look natural.  Gay-ass.  Hello? Hello?  Cartman?  Why'd you call us? ...You put Kenny's picture on a milk carton?? No it's not, Cartman. You know, there really are couples out there who are missing children. ...Okay Cartman, what do you want this time? ...Nuh uh.  Hohly crahap, duhude, heh!  Uh Eh-heh. L-look, if you want an explanation, you you'd better go to Kenny's house. Ehheh, Cartman, what the hell are you doing?  Blew a funny fuse? Butters! Hey Butters! You have to check this out! You gotta come to Kenny's house with us. Alright.  Butters! Hey Butters! They found the butt-face people's son, Butters. They're gonna have a big reunion at the milk company! Dude, that poor kid.  Well, looks like everything turned out alright for them. Well wait a minute. Don't you see what happened? Everything turned out okay for those people. And so now you can laugh. When Cartman first opened the door, and saw the Thompsons, he felt bad for playing a joke on them. Now that everything's turned out alright, he's able to laugh. There is no such thing as a funny fuse, Cartman. You felt bad. Our little man is growing up, Stan. He's growing up. What's he look like? I'm stoked my cousin is comin' to live with us. It'll be just like having a brother.  Hey dude.  Oh, uh, wawawhat is this? Oh is, is this beef? Uha, wa, actually, I- I can't eat beef. I have a degenerative problem with my intestinal lining, and beef really gives me gaass. Oh no, I d- I don't want to be a bother, I uh- We-ull, some fish would be great if it isn't too much trouble. What's this comforter filled with? Um, it isn't filled with down, is it? Ih it sure is quiet up here in the mountains and it's dry, too. Do you have a humidi-humidifier? Uh, can you take my stupid glasses and put them on the night stand. Make sure they're close by, because that fish upset my stomach and I might need them if I have to go to he bathroom later on.  Hello, I'm Kyle's cousin Kyle. I can't believe how cold it is out here. It's a really dry cold; that's the problem. It- the cold air makes me wheeze.  Ot- Nice to meet you, Cartman. Yuh you know, I saw that same jacket you're wearing at Bosco's for $29.95. How much was yours? Um, I juh- I was just wondering if Bosco's is a ripoff?  Cartman?! Oh well, I I grew up in the shity, ah ah I really don't care for it. Ah I come from a Jewish family, which of course you already know, because Kyle's from the same family.  I like to read, and I have these polyps on the backs of my hands - I don't know what they are. ...Oh, and I hope one day to be an investment banker. Uh where should I sit? There's no place to sit down here. Eh, oh, alright.  Ah-ah-ah-are wooden desks all that available? I usually prefer the plastic ones because these give me splinters. Is it cold in here? I realize we're in the mountains, but do we have to freeze to death? Oh, bu- but isn't the cold air making the ball really hard? Ih-it's gonna hurt my hands. Alright then, hu-how do I catch it? Now what? But it's down in the snow. But I'll get snow on my gloves and then it will melt and I'll have wet hands. Alright, then.  Uh you did what?  You, you paid your friends tuh...  not make fun of me? Wow uh, you think it takes forty dollars to get people to like me. Because I m-I mean I really think you could have done it for about $12.50. Well, I mean, you didn't just start at 40, didja? You you gotta low-ball these things so you have a place to go. Boy it sure is dry out here.  I'm ba-ack! I don't know about this, guys. I think sleds are dangerous. It seems like I might get splinters, though. Hold on. I see.  Oh, Jeezus, this sled is going faaaast. I have to watch out for my glasses. Ow! Ow, it's so cold! Oh Jesus!  It's a least a couple of hours.  I'm ba-ack.  Ah- I was just sledding, and the next thing I knew my sled rope got tangled with a bus, uh. I gut dragged for over a hundred miles before the bus finally stopped for gas.  I'm sorry about your sled, Kyle. Oh, my ears feel like they're frozen off, and I think I have a hemorrhoid from sitting on the sled for so long. I don't know about this guys. I think playing hide and seek in the airport might be dangerous. Can't we just play hide and seek at home? Oh, Jesus!!  In there? But it's very confined. I'll get cramps in my legs. Uh, alright then.  Oh, Jesus, this bus is going fast!  Oh, I did it again!! I'm back. Yeah, it was the craziest thing. I hid myself on a plane to Antarctica. Oh, it was so dry down there.  Well, Kyle, I I gotta go. Yeah, I've gotta get back to Connecticut. Well, I- I invested in that IT thing, and there was a bailout, so I received a five million dollar bailout clause check, which, which I can use to help my family, so, I- I guess, goodbye, cousin.  Yeah, I don't know what to do with it, though. Well, see ya. Re- really? Listen, guys, I appreciate you wanting me around, but, the fact of the matter is, well, yeh, you guys are just kind of douche bags. I mean, yeyou people are all just such hick jock rednecks; it's just like you right out of a stereotyped catalog.  Haha! Aharmani Exchange? Yeah, dude.  Nobody does. They're too expensive.  Is that fun? Alright. I'll kick you in the nuts, Stan!  Yeah. We're guys, dude. We find something about ''all'' our friends to rip on. We made fun of you for being rich just like we make fun of Butters for being wimpy. Right. And Stan for being in love with Wendy. And Cartman for being fat. And Cartman for being stupid. And Cartman for having a whore for a mom. And Cartman for being a sadistic asshole No dude. Because since you got your feelings so hurt for being ripped on, now we think you're a pussy.  Come on, Nurse Tolkien. We're gonna play football, you puss. Yeah, that was pretty good.   You've had that cough a while, Kenny. You okay? What, did he lose a hundred pounds?  Alright, Cartman! What's so important you had to pull us away from lighting cow crap on fire?! A trampoline? ...What?  I'm leaving right now!   And what the hell does that have to do with anything?! Oh, and what do you know about stem cells?! They're cells that come from fetuses, and some research show that they could be used to treat diseases. ...I hate you so much.   Yeah, they're gonna get busted again. We don't know where Cartman is, Ms. Choksondik! Aw man, here we go again! Use the Jew as a scapegoat. Alright, we don't know for sure why Cartman is ditching school, but it has something to do with abortion. That's all we know. Kenny's sick? Wait. Kenny's going to die? Cartman.  Kenny's in the hospital. They told us he has a m-muscular disease. An and, that ...and that he, he might die.   Hey dude, how's it going? Heh, don't, don't tell him what it is, dude. Hey, uh- we were all just talkin' about how when you get better, we're all gonna go down to Stark's Pond again and go camping. Huh, Stan?  Stan, where are you going? Dude, he needs us right now. I, I know it's tough but-  I know it's tough, okay?! I know! But we have to be tough right now! Look, however hard you think it for you, it's a lot harder for him! Stan, you can't leave!  Cartman? Cartman, were you... crying? Hey Cartman.   Sure you will, Cartman. Sure you will. ...And see? Here's one from Butters. It says, "We can't wait to see you back in school, Kenny." And it has a picture of him and you in a little airplane!  Stan? Oh. Well, no, there's nothing here from Stan, but, well, Stan's gonna come and see you real soon, I bet, Kenny. Neat, huh Kenny? He said his wish is not to die.  He said Madonna is an old anorexic whore who wore out her welcome years ago, and that now she suddenly speaks with a British accent and she thinks she can play guitar and she should go fuck herself.  He just... He just... stopped breathing. And it was over. He just said... "Where's Stan?" What, Cartman? I actually hugged you. I held you in my arms and, and, cried with you. AAARGH!  What? Yeah - no - I'd, it, it sounds really cool. So? What?! They can't say "shit" on television! Holy fucking shit! Aw, come, on dude! This is history. Sh! Jesus Christ! Another commercial? Are they ever gonna say "shit?" Where are you going, Kyle? But you're gonna miss it! They're gonna say "shit" and you're gonna miss it! Oh. I can't believe they actually said it.  Wow! We can say "shit" in school now?! Me neither. This sucks. Now that "shit"'s out, it isn't fun to say it anymore. What's meecrob? What? What's that? What's the Black Death, Chef? Look, they're puking out their intestines, just like the people here.  ''Word'' of curse? Because it brings a curse? Like the Black Death. Holy shit! Uh oh. Now what are we gonna do, Chef? Oh shit! What are we supposed to do with it? It might hold the key to a curse. Dude, we need help from the British! You know what it is? Well, yeah, but I don't think that we knew "curse word" meant... curse word. Look, there's the F-word. All the world destroyed? Yeah. We all gotta make sure it doesn't come back. And besides, too much use of a dirty word takes away from its... impact. We believe in free speech and all that, but... keeping a few words taboo just adds to the fun of English. Yeah! And Kenny didn't die! Holy shi-  poop. It's gonna suck. There's gonna be like, new kids there we don't know. Was your dad in Scouts, Cartman? Oh yeah, you don't have a dad.   Are you excited for your first night of Scouts, Timmy?? Hey, it's Big Gay Al! See ya, Dad! Jimmy's funny, dude. Hey, I have a ''great'' idea! Why don't we see if Jimmy wants to come be in ''our'' Scout club? Hey Jimmy, do you wanna join ''our'' bake sale in South Park tomorrow? Bye, Big Gay Al. We had a great time. You were right, Dad. Scouts is awesome! We told ghost stories, a-and learned how to make a tornado in a glass bottle! And best of all, we met this kid named Jimmy. He's disabled, but he doesn't let it ruin his life! He's awesome! Cartman, don't say "use him", you big silly goose.   I just... called Cartman a name- he's a, he's a silly goose. Dad, I was just tryin' tuh-  Uh, hello? We are having a bake sale to raise money for scout troop number six nine. Uh, please stop by and give us a hand. And now, for your entertainment, our new best friend, stand-up comic Jimmy!  Big Gay Al, what are you doing?! Kicked out? Oh no! Please, Big Gay Al. We don't wanna go on a camp trip with this guy next week. What do we want? When do we want it? What do we want? When do we want it? What do we want? When do we want it? What do we want? When do we want it? Alright, this looks like the perfect place to get some signatures.  Alright, let's set up.  That's a great idea!  Attention, ladies and gentlemen! Now, for your entertainment, stand-up comic, Jimmy! Dude, this looks like it could get ugly.  Jesus Christ, dude!  We did it! We did it! Huh? So wait, did we do good?  Wow, I never knew Jimmy was gay. What's going on?  How'd he do that?? No way! His a-miracles? Yeah!  Kyle, I'm starting to think that this is a really bad idea. No, I'm Stan. Who are you? Kyle, I think we may have gotten into something bad here. Look at us, dude. These people are trying to change us somehow. I think it's time we went home. I don't care! I'm leaving!  I'm going home. You said we're free to leave whenever we want Move out of the way. I don't wanna talk about it, I jus' wanna leave.  That's okay, I... I changed my mind. I'm... gonna stay. Okay, it's all clear.  We're getting out of here. This whole thing has gotten way out of hand. Come on, Kyle, this is stupid! A part of what?! Some gaywad magician's crazy life plan?! No, they've just ''convinced'' you that he's a brilliant man! Let's go! Goddamnit, I'm not going with you! I wanna stay here! Oh wait, who am I again? Oh- oh yeah. God- Goddamnnit, hold on a second.  Okay. Now look, dude, I'm getting out of here, and you're a dumbass if you don't come with me! Kyle, please. You-  You're my best friend. HaaAAAA!  Hi, Jesus. It's me. This guy is going around doing magic tricks and saying they're miracles! My friend Kyle thinks he's totally awesome! I read in the Bible that you did miracles, too. If you could go in front of these people and do your miracles, then, they'll all see that David Blaine isn't so special. Can you do it again? That's it? That's how you did that trick? That trick sucks, Jesus. Dude, we have to do something. This guy is performing more miracles in Denver tonight. He's gonna get more followers, and it'll be impossible for me to get Kyle out. But dude, I'd I don't think you should do that lame water-to-wine trick. Then what are we going to do. Super best friends? To where?  I am ready. Yeah. So you mean to tell me that even though people fight and argue over different religions, you guys are all actually friends? Wow. I knew it. Wow, the Moses.  Kyle! Kyle! Kyle??  Oh my God, they've killed Kenny! Kyle?  Oh my God, they've killed Kenny! Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!  Kyle! Kyle, you can't kill yourself! Kyle, you have to hold your breath!   You don't need David Blaine to tell you how to live. See, cults are dangerous because they promise you hope, happiness and, maybe even an afterlife. But in return, they demand you pay money. Any religion that requires you to pay money in order to move up and... learn its tenets is wrong. See, all religions have something valuable to teach, but, just like the Super Best Friends learned, it requires a little bit of them all. Your my Super Best Friend too, Kyle. What's no big deal? Pubic hair. He's saying he got his first pubic hair. He's lying.   What?? Cartman, you are so goddamned stupid, it's unbelievable. When you get old enough, you grow your ''own'' pubic hair that's attached to you, you fuckin' dumbass! One please. Yeah, why should we all care about getting Scott Tenorman back for you?  Oh my God, he killed Kenny. Got what all figured out? Yeah. This is the dumbest thing you've ever done, Cartman. Oh nothing, it's just cool how you're gonna get Scott Tenorman back. Is Radiohead here yet? Jesus Christ, dude!  Who are you? Good call. Oh man, this is another rerun. Because I had an itch up my ass. When are they gonna make new ones? What's this? Enough! I know! Dude! Did you get 'em? Yep. Tomorrow night. Ah, I'm sorry, but the four of us can't help tomorrow night. No, dude, we really, really do. Huh? Yeah, he looks terrible. Uuuuhh. Phillip? That's not Phillip. Come on, guys, we're getting to the bottom of this.  'Scuse us. It's okay. We're the official presidents of the Terrance and Phillip fan club. You don't understand! We saved Terrance and Phillip's lives once. Man, this sucks! I don't think we're female groupies or random sluts. We're not quadruplets, Terrance. We snuck in that woman's spandex to get in here. But where's Phillip? Because, dude, it's Terrance and Phillip. What if we can get Phillip to agree to get back together. Will you do the Earth Day show for us? Oh no, dude. They're not together anymore, dude. But there's nothing we can do. Phillip is doing Shakespeare in Canada now. Jesus Tapdancing Christ, is this thing ever gonna end?   Phillip! Phillip! Our town in Colorado was chosen to host Earth Day this year and... we need a big act.  Ah, well, we were thinking how cool it would be if you and Terrance got back together for a reunion and- But we need you! He'll do it, dude. Two thousand dollars. Dude, you didn't tell him Terrance would be there. I'm sure they'll be here any minute. Oh my God! Ee yeah, you must have a lot of catching up to do. But let's rehearse first. Fine!   Okay. Okay, I think we lost them. Guys, we have no choice. We're gonna have to move away. Environmental activists don't use logic or reason. Go! Run run run!  Come on, Kenny, hurry up! They're back! It sure did. "There you are, Jennifer Lopez!"  "You've been most uncooperative, Ms. Lopez." "It's too late for that, Ms. Lopez."  Yeah, awesome! ...Why? You'd better not be lying, Kenny.  Oh my God. Dude, can you loan me twenty bucks for a new jacket? Yeah, it's unbelievable. Come on, we gotta see what Cartman is doing with his money.  Kyle?  Dude, what are you doing here? Everybody's looking for you. Kyle? Kyle, I, I understand what you mean, but-- Look. Cartman... he thinks he's gonna be happy because he has his own amusement park, but, he's gonna find out that without other people, the rides are totally lame. I mean, who could really have fun by themselves at a theme park? I'll bet he's sick of it already.  Oh, hey, dude. Terrance & Phillip is just about to start. What's that? Heh, heh.  Sorry. Dude, just forget about it. We can't let him get to us, or he wins.  That does it, dude! We're getting into that fatass's park whether he likes it or not!  Come on, dude! Aw, crap. Dude!  Alright, let's go. You can't keep us out forever, you fucking fat ass! We'll be back as soon as Kyle's hemorrhoid is better! You'll see! We'll get in!  Dude, are you okay? Well um, ah-I found out that Cartman is letting a few people each day into his theme park. I was thinking we could put on disguises and get in. Jesus. Goddamnit Cartman, let me in! It is stupid, Cartman! You made Kyle lose his faith in God, you fat asshole! AGGH!  This isn't over, Cartman! Kyle, you gotta see!!  Doctor, can we wheel Kyle out of here on his bed with the machines attached? Then damnit man, do it! Look, Kyle. Look.  Kyle! Look, Kyle, Cartman is totally miserable.  Even more miserable than he was before because he's had his dream and lost it.  "So, we meet again, Jennifer Lopez!"  "Scream for me, bitch!" Oh no, what now? Cartman, what the hell are you doing? Whoa, cool!  I had no idea dogs made milk; do it again. Wow, you learned all this from the fifth graders?  Mom! Dad! You gotta see this! But it's super-cool! Red rocket. Red rocket, Sparky. Red rocket.  Red rocket, red rocket! I'm beating off the dog. Red rocket, red rocket.  My room? Why? No! Why?! What's the big deal?! I was doing "red rocket" to make the dog's milk come out. Huh?? What things?? No! Dude, haven't you ever had intercourse, Mr. Mackey? It's dumb. Mr. Mackey doesn't teach us nothin'. Yeah.  Hey Wendy, did you guys get- You guys, we just wanna know- Why? ...A what? Dude, Mr. Mackey didn't know anything about anything.  But Wendy, we don't understand how that- Dude, we gotta go get condoms quick. Yeah, we need condoms! Why does ''that'' matter? Well, I'm glad this lady's on our side. Doesn't it give any other directions? Don't look at Butters' schlong, gaymo! How do you feel? Alright, here, everybody.  Tweek, give everyone a rubber band. Hey, somebody's gotta help Timmy put his condom on. Man, this condom's driving me crazy. From sex?? All this time... It's the ''girls'' that give ''us'' diseases!  Yeah, come on guys, this is war!  Ha! They're ''your'' diseases! That does it! Attack!  We just didn't want the girls giving us diseases. But Chef, when is the right age for us to start having sex? Well, I guess we got a while to wait before we have to worry about sex and diseases, huh, Wendy? HA, I blew your head off! Jesus, is Cartman still in the bathroom? Dude, he's in there punishing my toilet. Come on, Cartman! You're missing the game! Yeah. Hey Mom, Cartman found a bloody cotton thing in the bathroom.  What is it, Mom? The 2001 Okama GameSphere? There it is. The Okama GameSphere.  What's that? Alright, alright, but you guys gotta see if you can sleep over for the rest of the weekend.  It's Saturday at 2:30 - that means we have... 39 hours to play GameSphere until school on Monday! What? Dude, we got GameSphere. What? ...O-kay. No.  G'night Mom, thanks for GameSphere. Oh, yeah, we got baseball practice today. God damnit! Well, it's alright. We can still play for  six more hours, and then we'll go play baseball. Okay, we will. Oh, dude! Did you see that? I cut off your face and ate it! No no, it's okay, Mom. We c-we can't go to baseball practice 'cause Kyle has cancer. Oh, uh, I'm sick. But Mom... Can't believe we have to go to school! We just have to try and make the day go as fast as possible so we can get back to GameSphere.  Fine. This is gonna be one looong-ass day.  That was the longest day of school ever! It... it was right here. Hello? What? Who-who is this? Don't hurt it!  They've taken it. They've taken our Okama GameSphere. Towelie! I don't know. They guy on the phone thought we had Towelie, so now we gotta find him. This is hopeless. We're never gonna find him. Hey yeah.  Let's go waterskiing! Come on, dude!  They said the gas station outside of town. Who is that?  'Scuse me, can we have our Okama GameSphere back? We just wanna play video games. You ''called'' us and said if we brought the towel you'd give us our video game back. Goddamnit, what now?!   Where is our Okama GameSphere? Do you know where he's talking about, Towelie? Alright, we're gonna have to use this truck. Come on, guys.  A little more gas, Kenny.  Brake, Kenny, brake.   Dude, don't you remember where it is? Alright, so where is it? Alright, that does it! Brake angrily, Kenny!  Now listen, Towelie, we've just about had it with you! What? Ah hi, is this where our Okama GameSphere is? We don't care. Dude, we don't care. We... don't... care.  Don't care, don't care, don't care. Can you tell us where "that" is, please? We're not doing it for the world, we're doing it for our video game. God, are you deaf? Yeah.  What? So that'd be, like what, eight hours we could play before school?  Hurry up, stupid parachute! Come on, Towelie! The guy said you have the security system in your memory banks. Oh, God damnit! Alright, fine!  No, Towelie, the entry code! God-damnit, I guess we're gonna have to climb the stupid fence. Do you have our Okama GameSphere? Oh God, don't care, don't care. So let me get this straight: Our Okama GameSphere is back at Tynacorp. But we don't care! We're just going in to get our video game back. Hello? Hello, anybody here?  Ohmigod, look!  Aw, sweet, it still saved our plays.  Oh, there's gold. Get the gold, Kenny! Hurry up, Kyle! This place is coming apart!   Aw, crap! Come on, guys. Let's go play video games! Oh, dude, we finished level 50! Alright, guys, focus. Looks like this is gonna be an underwater level. Butters, what the hell are you doing? Yeah! If you don't have a gas mask, you're gonna get smallpox or anthrax! There's nothing you ''can'' do except stop breathing.  Hey Mom, door bell's ringin'. Hey, look at what the postman brought me! It's a big brown package from Afghanistan! We sent the Afghani kids some dollars - they must have sent us something cool in return!  Do you have some scissors to get this open? Well alright.  We got a package from the kids we sent dollars to. They sent us something back. Oh, it's just a goat.   Hey there, little guy. I told you: those Afghan kids just wanted to give us something back for giving them four dollars. Yu- you're gonna have to take it home with you, Kyle. Kenny? ''My'' parents will ''never'' let ''me'' keep a goat No, we're not gonna kill it, Cartman! We'll just have to  Excuse me, we wanna overnight this goat to Afghanistan, please? They're not. Well yeah! The military planes. Come on, goat, we'll put you on one of them.  I don't care! We're going! Okay, thanks, Towelie.  Goddamnit, get the hell out of here, Towelie!  Alright, come on. We just gotta get the goat on one of these planes.  Well, uh, we've gotta get Miss Nicks on the plane to Afghanistan, guys.  Ah, sorry. Miss Nicks isn't answering any more questions. 'K, let's put him on here.   Shhh. There we go. You're gonna be okay, goat. You'll be back in Afghanistan in about 20 hours. Dude, looks like we're going tooh... Afghanistan. Twenty hours!  Hey look! There's a taxi!   I think so.  A-ah, hi. We're from America.  Uh, we sent you the dollar? Uh, the four dollars? You, you sent us this goat? Here. Wu-we don't want it. No, dude, we're n- we're not ungrateful. It's just... none of us can keep the goat. Oh uh, and here.  Yeah, they told us in school that everyone but terrorists love America. Hey! Hey, open the door! How come they hate America so much? What the hell did ''we'' do? Alright.  Oh look, he's following us. It's so sad. What?   You've gotta listen to me! We're not spies!  Dude, these people are insane. Hey, what are you guys doing here? Hey, shut up, kid. America didn't start this war. But why? Why does a third of the world hate us?  ...That doesn't make sense. You guys are just buttholes! ...He's got us there, dude.  Hey, wait a minute. You know, you guys should know one thing.  Most people in America are good people. We just try to live day by day, like you guys do. Maybe if you took some time to see all the great things about our country, you'd see... we're not so different after all. Oh... Well, I guess, maybe, someday, we can learn to... hate you too. Come on, let's go get to the plane.  No, dude. America may have some problems, but it's our home. Our team. And if you don't wanna root for your team, then you should get the hell out of the stadium.  Go America.  Yeah, go Broncos.   Did you go yet? What's he want? Goddamnit Cartman, what?!  That isn't funny, Cartman. ...Dude, that's not funny if they're missing their son. No way!  Cartman, where are you going??  Oh boy. Yeah. He lives about four houses away in the bad side of town. Yeah, you missed them turning around. What? Yeah, dude, we'll show you. They're over at Kenny's. How the hell should ''we'' know?  There's these two people with asses where their heads should be. But dude, you gotta see it; it's hysterical! Why are you wearing a paper bag on your head? Dude, the ass-faces' son is Ben Affleck!  Hey, you're laughing, Cartman. Huh? Oh, you're right. Cartman had a feeling of remorse.  Wow, Cartman actually felt bad for somebody and couldn't laugh at them. Yeah, I guess we all are. Maybe things are finally gonna start getting a more sophisticated around here. Hey dude. What the hell was that? I know, dude. Every kid in school wants to kick his ass. Dude, a self-hating Jew? You ''are'' becoming a stereotype. Book. Later, dude.  Yeah, as soon as we get to the concourse you'll see how fun it is. Yeah. He'll be waaay better off back at home.  So dude, did Cartman's idea work? Damn! Yeah, haha. Your family ''is'' rich, dude. Yeah, dude, your family is so rich they have their own pool table. Oh hey, dude. Did you bring the movie?   What's that? DVD? We don't own a DVD player. Come on, guys. We'll just have to find other stuff to do.  I don't know. We don't have horses, so we can't play. I'll kick you in the nuts, Cartman!  Oh hey, there's Token.  Dude, we're gonna play football. Do you wanna play? Sure, dude, you're our friend. Dude, just because we rip on you for being rich doesn't mean we don't like you. Yeah, like we rip on Kyle for being a Jew. Yeah, I get it for that. Oh, but we're not gonna rip on you for being rich anymore.  Yeah, so now you're a pussy. Pussaholic. Well that burned a long time.  Oh dude, there goes one. What, Butters? Tell him we're busy. Alright, let's go see what he wants.  What? A boat? Well WHAT, Cartman? Cartman, what the hell are you doing with aborted fetuses?! Stem cells? Dude, it looks like Cartman and Kenny are ditching school again. The principal? Aw, come on! Wait. What's going on here?  Well how sick?  ...but... the doctors are gonna make him better, right? Mom? That's what hospitals are for. They, they can make him better.  ...But... he's our... fu... fufu- friend. No! This can't happen! Kenny can't die! Kenny can't die!!   Don't you say that! Kenny's not gonna die!  I can't, I just can't.  I can't see him like that, Kyle. All those hoses and wires. He's a kid, dude. He's s'posed to be running around and laughing. And what are we supposed to do, huh?! Stand in that room and keep making small talk?! Make believe like everything's okay?! I CAN'T DO IT!  Just leave me alone!  Hey Chef. Bad. Why would God let Kenny die, Chef? Why? Kenny's my fr-f-f-friend. Why can't God take someone else's f-f-friend? But then, why does God give us anything to start with? I think I understand. Yeah. I'm gonna see my friend, because he needs me right now. Hey, Kenny!  No. But...  Did he say anything before he went? I let Kenny down. I'm his worst f-f-f-friend.  What, Cartman? What's happened? This whole time, you were just using Kenny's illness to lift the ban on stem cell research so you could sell your stupid fetuses? Hey, I wasn't Kenny's worst f-f-f-friend!  Butters was missing? Damn, dude. Wow dude, your dad's a perv and your mom tried to kill you. Really? [pause] ...Oh.  You guys!!! Hey you guys!!! Oh my God!! Oh my God, you guys!! I was just-  I was just watching the TV! They had this commercial. So, guess what they're gonna say tonight on that show, ''Cop Drama''. No, come on! Guess! They're gonna say something that's never been said on television. You'll never guess. Guess. You ready?  "Shit." It was just on the news! People are freaking out, dude. Yeah. I'm gonna have people over to my house to see it. Maybe you didn't hear me, Kyle: I said "shit" on television! Jeez, you're a little irritable, Kyle. What's the matter? You got some sand in your vagina? Goddamn it! When are they gonna say "shit"?! I'm sure they're just holding it 'til the very last scene. Dude! You missed it, Kyle! It was so awesome! Kyle, we've gotta get that sand out of your vagina. It's making you cranky. Does it itch? Whoa, dude, it's raining frogs.  Huh? I don't get it. Wow, this is gonna be great! A whole new word! Don't mind Kyle, everyone, he's just got a little sand in his vagina. Yeah, they've taken all the fun out of "shit". We're gonna have to start saying other bad words, like cock and fuck and... meecrob.  You know, that stuff you get as an appetizer at Thai food restaurants. Meecrob, dude, is way grosser than "shit", dude. I'd scarf down a whole wet bucket full of shit before I ate another plate of meecrob.   Oh, Kyle, you are so full of meecrob. Kyle, do you ''still'' have sand in your vagina about us not going to ''The Lion King'' with you?! I mean, shit, dude, let it go.  thinks that "shit" might have something to do with everyone getting sick. You guys, look here.  In this Nancy Drew mystery, Nancy goes to the beach and gets sand trapped in her shoe. This could explain how Kyle got it in his vagina. So am I, Kyle. If that sand in your vagina doesn't get released, you could become a walking time bomb.  Oh-Ho, gross! Kenny's got it. heh heh.  Goddamn it, Kenny! Don't get your plague germs on me! But... we ''can'' keep the Halo the Turtle dolls, right? I knew it! Meecrob!  Meecrob ''is'' a curse word! God must hate it as much as I do! My house, too?  What a stupid voice.  Hah, I love you guys. That's not funny! Jesus Christ! Yeah, he's excited.  Hey, Butters. Hey, yeah! Yeah, we learned how to make cakes and muffins for our bake sale. Yeah, we're gonna use him to help raise money in our bake sale. Don't call ''me'' an asshole, you som' bitch. Hehe, I don't sound like that. Cripple fight!  Awww!  Man, this guy sucks. Yeah! Get your big gay ass off the couch and come be our scoutmaster again! But you ''have'' to come back. We ''hate'' our new scout leader.  Cripple fight! Cripple fight!   Eh, we kick ass.  Who's this asshole? Hey, where'd you guys get that ice cream? Yeah, and they probably teach you how to do magic tricks! When are we gonna learn magic tricks? Then we get to be in David Blaine's secret club? Cool.  Heheh, guess who I am, you guys? Uh it... doesn't matter, ma'am. Blaintology is for everyone. There are Blaintologists who are Catholics, Buddhists - why even Kyle here is a Goddamn Jew.  Of course, no. David Blaine is a real person. You may have seen his television specials on ABC. He also wrote a book, and we'd like to share it with you. Cool.  Ma'am, have you ever wondered what David Blaine's plan is for you? Oh, you see, that, that's interesting because... I'm so thankful for David Blaine's book, and, I'm so thankful that he showed me the way to true happiness but, I think about his plan often. He's going to eat his own head. Oh, come on, it'll make you a happy person. No you're not. No you're not. No you're not. No you're not. Yes, Brother Kyle hmm, but our work is not over. We must still recruit ten more audience members in order to get the prize. Come, Brother Kyle, we have no time for him.  What's he doin' here?  Now how the hell did he do that?   Did you hear that, guys? We're finally gonna die!   Brother Kyle? Why do you disturb my rest? What? Yeah, I know what you mean. I don't wanna die either.  I haven't even gotten my pubes yet. That co- ugh.  That could be difficult, Brother Kyle. But alright, listen: Why don't we sleep on it? If we decide to leave the faction, we can... do it in the morning. I told on yoo-ou. I told on yoo-ou. This is for your own good, Brother Kyle. Ah, and you know what else Kyle said? Um Kyyyle, he said that if we were all gonna commit suicide, that he wouldn't do iiit. At least I'm not the boy in the plastic bubble! Alright, Brother Kyle, it is time for us to die!   . Hey, I was just about to do it. Oh, that's so sweet you guys.    Oh, nothing. No big deal, really. Well, guys, it seems that I am the first one of us to reach manhood after all. Well, because, unlike ''you'' guys, I just got my first pubes! ''Ayada da daa, yadadadadee! [dances]'' Oh yes I did! I'm becoming a man! You wanna see 'em?  Here, check 'em out. There, see? How do you like ''them'' apples!  HA! My pubes. I got 'em from Scott Tenorman. Yup. He let me have 'em for just ten bucks.    You'll get your pubes guys, someday. Uh oo what? Nuh uh!  But then why would Scott Tenorman sell me his pubes for ten dollars? You're telling me these pubes are worth nothing.  Huh I'm gonna get that son-of-a-bitch. Uh, yes, I've come to return these pubes that I purchased, please? Right, but you see, I didn't realize, when I bought these pubes from you, that you were full of shit! So you can either give me back my ten dollars, or I can go tell my mom on you! Just give me back my money... Gimme my ten dollars, Scott!  Tax evasion is a very serious offense, sir! I suggest that you... You will? Oh, cool! Oh. Uh, lessee.  I only got six dollars and twelve cents. ...Okay. Right. Cool. Sweet!  Uh. Oh, goddamnit! That asshole! That big, smelly, ass-sniffin' asshole! I'm gonna get him! What? He is not smarter than me! He just charmed me, that's all! He's a charmer, that Scott Tenorman!! But I'll get him someday!!  One please.  O-kay, and how much is that in pubes? Listen, my money is as good as anybody's! Don't you, uh, discriminate against my people by not accepting these pubes. Racist!  Scott, Scott! Courtney Love is in South Park! She's all drunk and spreading her legs and showing her poonanner to everybody! You gotta go check it out! I'll watch your house for ya!  What?  why do you want then back so much? I don't believe you. Pube fair? Five bucks a hair? The- that's like a million dollars! Hoho, I don't think so, Scott! I'm going to Fort Collins myself! Haha, charade you are, Scott!   Hohoho! I won a million dollars!! Whew! Ow! Hahaaha! Ha. Ha. Heh. Huh, excuse me, sir. Can you tell me where the pube fair is? Yeah, I have some pubes to sell. No- no such thing? I'm Eric Cartman.  Aaah!!! A hundred and six miles, Scott. I had to ride a hundred and six miles in the back of a pickup truck... to get back here Alright, Scott, you win. I give up. Yeah, I'll see you around.  Sure is too bad about my grandma, though...  Huh? Oh, it's... it's not really your concern, since uh-... well, my grandma's in the hospital. She's very sick. The doctors say unless I can come up with sixteen dollars for her operation, they're gonna put her down. Yeah. Poor grandma...  Oh, wow, thanks a lot, Scott!  What? Huh? Why??  Please Scott give me my money. I beg you to give me back my money. What?  I'm a little piggy.  Here's my snout. Oink oink oink. What- What are you doing??  No!... Wh-why? [yells at the sky] Yaaaarrgh! ...You'll diiiiiiiiiie! ...Damn youuuuuuuuuu!  Yes, Clyde!  Sixteen dollars and twelve cents! He is a disease. He is a cold calculating mind, and I will have revenge! Did you guys see that movie "Hannibal"? Where the deformed guy trained giant pigs to eat his enemy alive?? Well, if we find a pony  It will be painful and humiliating! Everyone will see it happen! And then, Scott Tenorman will forever be known as the kid who had his wiener bitten off by a pony!!! WAHAHAHAHAA!!! What? Oh, right. Why should we care?   Christ. Alright, I guess it's just you and me, Timmy! There we go.  Oh no, pony, he'll like that. No, I'm trying to teach it how to bite someone's penis off.  He said it was okay. Because  of Scott Tenorman! I hate him! And I want to make him suffer!  Whattayou mean? How do I do that? I see Scott Tenorman. With his ginger red hair and his stupid freckles and his- Goddmnit goddamnit I hate him!!! Right, right. Let's see... There's posters. Radiohead posters! And he's reading a magazine about Radiohead! You know, that band that sings that song: ''Well, I'm a creep. I'm a weirdo...'' So, the subject is a big Radiohead fan, huh? Maybe I should come up with a  that involves them. Whoa! I'm looking in Scott's parents' room. Scott's mom's about to take off her bra. Radiohead. Yes, of course.   Oh, hey, Scott. How's it goin'? I was just wondering, do you like the band, uh, Radiohead at all? Oh, really? Oh, 'cause, they're doin' a big interview on MTV, and they're playing it tonight on a big screen downtown.  Everyone's gonna be there! You're welcome, Scott.  Okay. Well, it looks like everyone is here. Let's play the video, shall we?   I think all the guys in the band hate him, right guys? Oh, Jesus, did you hear that, Scott?   Yeah. Scott Tenorman is totally not cool! He's ''not cool''! Wow, that really sucks for you, Scott.    That does it! I'm gonna get Scott Tenorman once and for all!!! Hueah. You think you're so cool, Scott Tenorman? We'll see how cool you feel after this-uh! Yes. Yes! Yes!!  Stan, Kyle, thanks for coming. I have it all figured out! How to get Scott Tenorman back! I just finished planning a brilliant  It's the brilliant combination of my last two plans. Scott Tenorman's favorite band is Radiohead, right? So, I realized, 'What if we got Radiohead to come here to South Park?' right? Then they could meet Scott Tenorman — ''and'' — see him get his wiener bitten off by a pony!  Don't you see? If I can get this pony to bite off Scott's wiener in front of Radiohead, then Scott would cry. And if Scott cries, then Radiohead will say Scott Tenorman is totally not cool! And that would make Scott Tenorman wanna die!!  ...Fine, I'll do it myself!! You guys just watch!!   Hello, Scott! I was just stopping by to invite you to my Chili Con Carnival. It's a chili cook-off with rides.  Everyone's coming, and I wanted to drop by your invitation personally!  Yeah! There is even gonna be a big surprise, so you won't wanna miss it, Scott. Oh, and here! Here's a coupon good for one free pony ride! Oh, it will be very neat, Scott.  A little penis-biting, perhaps? Uhnothing, nuhothing! So you'll come for sure then, Scott? Sweeet. Killer. Bye, Scott.   Oh, hello, guys! Thanks for coming to my Chili Con Carnival!  Ohoho, it won't be so dumb when Scott Tenorman arrives. I suggest you stay to see the fireworks! What's so funny? Not yet, but they will be. Hey, Chef. What contest? Huh? Oh. Yeah, I guess it is. Uh, here, Chef, just put it over here.   Likewise. Well, come on, you've got to see the pony! Well, e-yeah, but, there's a special guest coming, and I want you to be near the pony when they arrive.  Goddamnit!  Alright.   Gawh, this is really good, Scott! What? You mean about how you put pubes in your chili?  Yehes, I'm afraid this isn't your chili, Scott. I switched it with Chef's.  I came just in time to see Mr. Denkins giving his report to Officer Barbrady. And of course, to steal the bodies...  I call it, "Mr. & Mrs. Tenorman Chili."   Mm, your tears are so yummy and sweet. Oh, the tears of unfathomable sadness! My-yummy.  Whoa, bummer, dude. Are you sure? I haven't seen it.  You guys! Hey you guys! You guys! Awesome! Give me mine!  Well yeah, dude. Where the hell is Phillip?! Phil-lip! I think this new guy's funny. Aw, dude, gay! Racist!  Don't talk to us, kid. Kenny's a random slut.  Agh! Wough! Man, it smells down there!  Weak. Look, if you don't come and do the show, I'll make you eat your parents! Oh, Kyle, you just made a huge withdrawal at the First Bank of Lies. We've got to get them back together, you guys. They could do this to ''us''. Kyle, none of this would be happening if you hadn't LIED in the first place! You lied, and then you lied to cover up your lie! Alright!  Look, Kenny, everything turned out okay! Mom, it's 3:30. This is taking up my whole Saturday. Why couldn't the funeral have been on a school day?  God! She didn't take this long to die. Great. Now can we go? Ogh! God-damnit..!  Mom, I wanna go home! Bluh bluh bluhbluh bluh bluh...  Oh, God, do you have to embarrass me even in death, Grandma?!  Hoosajiggawha? Uh yah sir, excuse me. D-Does this mean that I..have...one million dollars? No, no, wait, you don't understand.  since I was th-three years old it has been my dream to have one million dollars... Egh...   Look at it. Look at it, mother. See how the light reflects the spearmint green from its surface. I'm not keeping it, Mr. Garrison, I'm spending it. On my dream.  On the one thing that I've wanted ever since I could remember... Nuh uh, I'm spendin' it. Huh, I think God has plenty of money. Not much, just taking my  Would you mind stepping aside? I have a purchase to make. HA! If you need money, you can get a JOB, Stan! No freeloaders are gonna take ''my'' hard-earned cash! Didn't earn it?! What about all the years I spent making Grandma like me?! All the wet spit-filled kisses I put up with?! The constant smell of aspirin and pee?! Don't tell me I didn't earn it, you son of a bitch! My own amusement park, Mother. I'm sure. What?! Oh, but I'm not buying the park to get people to come. No no! I'm buying it to keep people out!  ...And, so you see, this park is for ''me''. Nobody else will be allowed in it. Gentlemen, I thank you.  I'm so happy! I'm so happy...!  Especially you, Stan and Kyle.  Aw, man, that was awesohome! That one part, with the, um, with the spider that dropped on ya? Oho, man, that totally got me. That was sweet! Heheh.  What the hell? You sons of bitches!   What the hell are you doing?!  That's right! You stay out! ...Alright, so listen: All I want you to do is keep anybody out who tries to get in here. If you see anybody on my propertih, especially Stan and Kyle, you are to shoot on sight! Alright, now this is very hard for me to do, you understand. But, in return for you working security, I'll let you ride two rides a day. But only two rides, and only if I'm not on them.  But, you can ride anything you want. And you don't have to wait in line. Dude, are you from Mars or something? Any ride you want. No lines. But I don't ''have'' any cash. I spent everything on this park. Ugh... Two people? Well, all alright, Goddamnit! I'll open the park to two people each day! But remember: anybody else you see trespassing the park... Sweet.  I just gotta cover my security expenses. Butters, Clyde, you can come in. The rest of you will just have to try another day. 'K, one park admission? That will be twenty-nine ninety five, sir.  Five cents is your change and enjoy your stay at Cartmanland. ...and enjoy your stay at Cartmanland.  What are you doing? Line? Lines! I HATE LINES!!! Can't you go on something else right now?  Ugh, alright, alright, hang on.  Security! Oh, Jesus! Uh, look, the haunted house ride broke down. I need you to fix it. But I don't know how it works. Ogh, alright, alright! I'll let two more people in each day so I can hire a maintenance person.   Wait a minute! Who are you? HA! Get the hell out of here, Stan! I thought you said buying a theme park was stupid! SECURITY! Get him out of here!  Eugh. Well, now I can finally get back to my riding my rides!  AAAGGGHHH....   AGH!  DAAGGHHHH!!  Just give me my money back. I changed my mind! I don't want your stupid park! You call this great?! I call it hell! Trade me back, goddamnit! '''''GODDAMNIT, GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY WAY!!!'''''  Good riddance, you stupid park! You can all kiss my ass!   Yeah? He-hey, that's my money! What?! Kenny?! He dies all the time! Ye-You can't take my money, Goddamnit! No! But I don't... ah... ah...  Hey! Hey Mr. Fun, I changed my mind. I need the park to make my money back. But I'm getting sued now. If I don't have the park, I lose everything! This can't be happening! AGGGHH!! It isn't fair!  You just build me up to chop me down, didn't you?! What about my dream?! What about my money?!  '''''I'M SO PISSED OFF!'''''  Ey! You used to work for me!  Oho, Goddamnit, this sucks! It's not fair! It's not fair; I wanna die! I wanna daaahahie!   Ey you guys! You guys! Come 'ere, you guys, come check this out! No, you guys, this is ''really'' cool. Come on!  Watch this. It's sooo funny.  I'm milking the dog. They make dog milk.  Ohooohhh! I told you guys.  Dumbass, you can only milk a dog once every few hours. It doesn't work if you beat off the dog again right away.  Don't you guys know anything? Yeah, I guess they thought we were cool, so they showed us how to do it—hey come here, dog. Dog, come here!  AIDS? Mr. Mackey didn't say nothin' about that. Yeah, you want us unprotected, asshole?! Just put it on, Butters. Butters, will you stop ff-fili-bustering? I wasn't looking as his schlong, I was seeing how to put the condom on! Do you feel protected? Yeah, but it makes going to the bathroom easier.  I'm putting on a new condom. I filled the other one up. So I don't get AIDS. I knew it! Girls lie! They lie right to your face! Here, talk to them, Butters. Just tell them that if they leave town peacefully, we won't have to resort to violence. Oh, bitch! Ooo, Butters? You're in big trouble now. Well, I guess now that that's out of the way, we can get on with our lives. Come here, boy!  That's it. Red rocket, red rocket. Come on, now. Come on, red rocket, dog. Red rocket now. Let a man take a crap!  You guys, look what I found in the trashcan in Stan's bathroom. It's like a bloody cotton thing wrapped in toilet paper. Because I thought it was a jelly doughnut, but look, check it out, it's all bloody.  Why?  Hey, it's like all bloody. It might be alive. This came out of you?? You just left it in the trashcan?!  You shouldn'ta done that. He's just a boih. Poor little feller. Wow, this is like finding trashcan gold, you guiys! Hey, this is ''all'' of ours. I'm the one who found Stan's aborted brother in the trashcan and blackmailed his mom into getting the GameSphere.  Kyle, I think you underestimate Okama GameSphere. Oh yeah, Thirst for Blood. Bring it. Bring it, bring it!   Yeah, but you still shouldn'ta done that. 'E's just a boih. Date-rape psychosis. Awesome! We shouldn't have this many responsibilities! We're children! Yes! Go away, you stupid towel!  That's... so... cool! It's Monday? What, dude?  Come on, man, this isn't funny!   No! ...No! Hey, towel! Hey maybe we'd better do a towel call.  Gebaayybeh! No it isn't. No it isn't. Egh! This is where you came from? Goddamnit! Can we ''please''... just get back to playing our video game, PLEASE?! Alright, I think we go over there.  You just have no long-term memory 'cause you get high all the time! I can preach to you all I want, 'cause you're stupid! Yeah, and you're a towel! We're never gonna play our Okama GameSphere again, are we? Whoa, check it out, guys, the parachute level. Could you turn it up? Hup hup. Come on, hang on.  Kenny! Towelie, don't let go of us, you God-damned towel! Kyle's almost there! Hooray! You're the worst character ever, Towelie. ...Not really. Those are my Hootie Owlie Round-Tip Scissors. Awww, come onnn! How am I gonna kill people with those? God-damnit!  HA! I'm not giving a dollar to those towelheads! Oh, I'm sorry, but I thought we were at ''war'' with these assholes! That dollar buys me a chocolate milk for lunch! What, do you want me to just get a regular milk for ten cents?  There's a lot of crazy stuff goin' on in the world, but, we're caught in the middle. It's not our fault. Yes, but they're sand monkeys!  God-damnit, I hate regular milk!!! Heh, four dollars for a goat? We got ripped off. Well, I guess we're gonna have to kill it. It's an Afghanistan goat, so it can't stay here, or else it'll choke on the sweet air of freedom. Oh no, not Towelie.  No, we don't wanna get high!! That's right!  Stan, if you're finished having your tearful goodbye with the goat, we'd like to go now, please?  Aw, son of a bitch!  Uh ho, you guys. It didn't smell that bad; you guys are overreacting. Uh, whatever! Oh, I'm sorry! Next time I'll just ask my fart nicely if it wouldn't mind staying tucked away for a while! God, what a craphole, dude! This is like East Denver! Jesus Chru-heist! What is this? The freakin' Flintstones? It was choking on the sweet air of freedom in America, so we brought it back to ''your'' crappy country.  What did you call us?! I told you! Jawas have no heart. You know, sand people.  God, I hate you so much, Stan! Ey, what the hell are you talking about?!  I'm not a god-damned Canadian, and neither are you! Dude, don't call me a Canadian!  Look, I think I can explain everything. You see, my friend Stan here is an oversensitive animal lover. He's got a boner for this goat, a-  Ogh! Dude, it's called deodorant, okay? It's not expensive. I'm gonna go take care of this prick! He's not crazy, he's an idiot. I know how to deal with these people.  Mehah...  What's up, bin Laden? Uh oh, 5:30, time to pray.  Allah, Allah, m'heh Uh oh! Mmm-mm!  Hey look! An infidel!  So ''that's'' what this is all about?  Mmmm! Tastes like chicken. The ''ass'' of a chicken! Woohoo!  Haduqaduqaduqa.  There you are! Where have you been? We have another anti-American video to create!  Hur-ry, get into wardrobe!  Oh, you look marvelous, dahling. Come on! The cameras are ready!  Yeah.   You guys! You guys! This is sooo funny! Dude, check it out: for picture day, Kenny got into his parka backwards, so that his ass shows through his hood. Look!  Yes it is!  ...Don't listen to that Jew, Kenny, it's totally funny. Uh oh.  Huh, how long 'til we get the pictures back? Four days?? Oh man, I can't wait that long! Heh, c'mon! C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon! C'mon c'mon! C'mon c'mon c'mon!  YES! YES!   Dude, dude! Check it out! This is the sweetest thing I've ever done!  Okay, hokay, I'm sorry Ms. Chokesonrocks! I'm sorry Ms. Choksondik. Hoh, Oh my God! More people have to see this picture, you guys. I'm gonna put it on the Internet or... No, wait! Kenny.  I just had the greatest idea... ever! Oh, yes, hello. I am helping out a family who has a missing child, and I was wondering if you could print his photo on your milk carton?  Yes, I have it right hmya.  You will?  Oh, ah, thank you for your help. Oh, yehes. Uh-heh. He has ah, blond hair, aha-and, ah, and a brown eye.  And, and big rosy cheeks!      Come on. Come on.  You guys, seriously, this is sooo sweet! Look at, look at the description. Brown eye!  Oh, it's soo com''pletely'' funny!! Ahaha this is certainly funny!! No there aren't. Jesus, grow up, you guys.  No, nonono! Because apparently these two people... also kind of look like they have butts where their heads should be!  Oh yes! And the best part is... they're coming here, to my house. And it's gonna be sooo funny!!  Oh God.  You guys, something's wrong. I think... I.. just.. saw the funniest thing I'll ever see. And I... think... I... blew a funny fuse.  I don't think anything will ever be funny again. Oh God. What have I got? Mr. Mackey, is it possible that you can see something so funny that it ruins your sense of humor forever? Two people with asses for heads. Ever since I saw them I can't laugh at anything. You know, all the usual stuff. Dirty jokes, funny movies, seeing someone die... [Mr. Mackey is shocked by the last one] This morning, I even saw a little girl get her fingers caught in a car door and... I couldn't laugh. I mean I... I knew it was funny, but I couldn't laugh.  So does that mean I'll never laugh again? Ugh.  Oh, dude, oh. Nothing's wrong with me. Uh- Jimmy! Thank God! Get in here!  Jimmy, you've always been my favorite standup comic. You've gotta help me. I've lost my sense of humor. I just have to find my funny bone again! Just try and make me laugh. Okay, let me have it. Okay, why? ...Naw, see? Somethng's wrong. I'm not laughing. Who's there? Orange who?  ...naw, that didn't work either. Who's there? An interrupting cow who  What's goin' on? Yeah, I guess now we'll have to call him Ben Assfleck.  Ben Assfleck, say that's funny. Hehey, you're right! Oho, this is great! Ben Assfleck!  A-heh, what? E-heh. No no no, I blew a funny fuse.  What's that thing? What? Forty bucks? Alright, alright. Aw, Jesus, why don't you just cut off my balls?  Could be tough. But I'll give it a shot.  ...Oh, man.   Ohmigod, I'm not gonna make it. I'm not gonna make it.  I... must.. fight it! Need... forty... dollars! Ugh, ugh! Oh! Maybe we'll have to send him to concentration ''camp''. AWGH! Damnit, damnit, damnit!  I just found out that in World War II, some Jewish people ''were sent'' to concentration camps. Oh, and see, I didn't realize that. But I understand now how you might've felt what I said in the classroom was a racial slut. But see, I had no idea. No, I'm seriously! Because, um, I was, I was talkin' to Craig, and Craig was all like, "Hey, did you know that in World War II they really HAD concentration camps?" And I was all like, "No way!" And this little light went on in my head like, "Aw man, no wonder Kyle thought what I said in the class, seemed like it was directed at his cousin." But, but I was literally talkin' about a concentration camp, you know, where you go for a week to learn and focus, you know. Oh, mahan.  Goddamnit, give me another chance! Haha,   He's faaahn.  1, 2, 3, 4...  He's faaahn. Heheheheheh.   I- I, I learned that... you shouldn't judge somebody because... that-no, wait.  ...Good job, Jew!  Stand by, please.  Oh, god dammit! Shutup, Jew!  Yes, well. For my project, I made a pencil, taped to a pen. In this way we see the duality of writing devices that occur in nature. Oh GODDAMMIT I HATE CHECK-MINUS! I'll make you eat your parents! Nothing!  Aw, that is such bullcrap! No! No, see, this is the fundamental flaw with the check check-plus check-minus system! The only reason Tolkien was able to do all that is because his family is rich! Oh, come on, Tolkien! Your new house is four times the size of anyone else's in town! And who else gets crab cakes and, and lobster tail in their lunch boxes?!  Ooooo, Armani Exchange! All the rest of us have to buy our clothes at J mart! Have you even been inside a J mart, Tolkien?!  Oh, looks like you landed on Park Avenue, Stan. You own me ten million dollars. Hey, you changed your clothes, Tolkien. Not too expensive for Tolkien's rich ass family, apparently.   Oh, Jesus, dude.  What in the hell are they doing? Well, let's just play our game, then. Alright, I'll start. I'll kick you in the nuts, Kenny!  Kick his nutsack!  Uh huh. Yeah. Hey. Ey, you did me already!   Oh you guys, you're not gonna believe it! Guess what I have sitting in my back yard? Better. Better. Better. Thirty-three aborted fetuses.  Oh yes. Mint condition, tax free. Oh, I guess you don't watch the news, Kyle! Stem cells, numbnuts!  It's been proven, Jew! I saw it on 3-2-1 Contact. With all the research that's going on, stem cells are worth three times their weight in gold. What I have in my back yard is an aborted treasure chest. Fine! I don't need you assholes! I can sell these fetuses all on my own! Yes, I'm making a delivery of these fetuses hyah?  Gee, that's terrible. So, uh who do I talk to about payment?  You're gonna love these fetuses, Larry. They're top notch. ...What?! We made a deal, Larry! I brought them all the way down here already!  Not now, Mom, I've only unloaded three feti; I've gotta sell the rest before they spoil.  eh, Butters? Are you through databasing the clientele sheet?  Alright, well, you gotta take over the telemarketing for a bit.  Just remember what I taught you and follow protocol. Next number to try is on the list. What is this, a PTA meeting?   In the ...hospital? Why?  Die? Kenny? Yeah. Yeah, of course. Let me get my coat.  We got you a present: it's a Gobo fighter. Heh, sorry.   ...You know, it's funny, Kenny. Stan and Kyle have always been sort of two best friends, you know, and... well I- I don't know if I ever told you this, Kenny, but um... I kind of always thought you were my best f-friend. I don't know. Don't you worry, Kenny. I I'm gonna find a cure for you. Everything's gonna be okay!   ' No! No, I mean, I, I got somethin' in my eyes. It's this uh, the air in here is just- uh.  Oh man. I'm gonna find a cure, Kyle. I swear to God I'm gonna find a cure. Doctor, can you tell me exactly how stem cells work? Not at all, but go on.  My God... So then, could stem cells be used on someone whose muscle tissue is wasting away? In other words, if a little boy was dying from a muscular disease, the stem cells could become new muscle tissue. Well, so then, if the stem cells are placed nest to s Shakey's Pizza, they would become another Shakey's Pizza! And you'd have your own Shakey's Pizza where you didn't have to charge yourself to eat! Hmmm. Looks like someone is gonna have to try and change the government's mind.  There's a pretty brave kid fighting for his life in the hospital right now, doctor. I'm gonna get him some bigger boxing gloves. Oh, doctor.  Oh, and doctor. ...Ah, never mind.  And so you see, now that the ban on stem-cell research has been lifted, we can sell your fetus to companies like Alder Labs. Look, I can offer you seventy-five dollars for that fetus right now, Jill.  Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, because uh, there's a little boy dying in a hospital right now who sure could use that baby more than you could. The stem cells from your fetus could help save his life. Alright! Now Kenny has a fighting chance. You guys! Come quick!  It's...  Look.  Stupid fetuses? It's my own Shakey's! I think I only need a hundred or so more aborted babies,  and I can finish up the kitchen. Aah! Kyle! ''[Kyle punches him across the face a few times] Kyle! ''[Kyle delivers a series of punches to the chest] Huho! We sure are. (Dude! We've gotta watch!) (Uh oh.) (Yeah, I didn't-  (Yeah.) (Yeah, see ya.) (Yeah!) (You got pubes??) (One please.) (Toronto?) (AAAAHH!) (OOOWWW!) (Aahhh!) (AH how!)  (Oh, well now that's sweet.) panting(You guys! You guys! You gotta come down to Cartman's house! You hear Cartman got a million dollars from his Grandma!) (Because! His grandmother just died and her will says Cartman now has a million dollars!) (No, swear to God it's true! Cartman's got a million dollars!)  (Wait until you see what I can do to the dog!) (Yeah they do!) (Waa-ooo!)  (Aw, Goddamnit!) (Woohoo!) (I don't know. Where could it be?) (Help help! Heeelllppp!)  (Nooo!)  (No fuckin' way, dude!)  (Oh, shit, we're locked in.) (Ee-hew-hoo!) (God-damn, it stinks like shit!) (Aww, that's bullshit!) (''You've'' ever done?!) (Ow!) (That's awesome)  (All right. I'm fine.) (A football machine?) (What the fuck are stem cells?) (Thank you, Doc.) (I'm all right) (I'm okay, I guess.) (Eric, well you're my best friend, too.) (Yes.)  (But what about Stan?) (I hope so)  (Stan??) (The Make-A-Wish Foundation?) (Yes.) (I guess the only thing I wish is to not die.) (No. Fuckin' Madonna...)  Hey, uh, Sam, did you hear the news? Yeah. Oh, sure, I mean, you know, ''Cop Drama'' is a very artsy, dramatic show.  Shipped. He said "shipped". Ya know, that word's kind of getting old. It's not really... funny anymore. Really? So we can't say  fag? ...Hey, you didn't get beeped. I, I can't follow this shitty storyline at all. That makes sense. Well, you boys must be pretty excited: Your first night of Scouts. Yeah. Both Kenny's dad and I were in Scouts for years. Alright, boys, we're gonna head to the bar. We'll be back to pick you up at nine. You're the new scout leader? He got to where he is by being a good scout; maybe we should just leave him alone. So he's a homosexual. So what? Aw, that's ridiculous. Come on, Stanley.  Come on, Stan.  What did you say?! You do not say "Big silly goose"! You call him an asshole like a normal kid! Stanley, you call your friend an asshole this instant! That's better. Nice to meet you.  Well, I guess we're off to the bar until nine, then. Wow, you sure whipped those kids into shape. You bet. See ya, Mr. Grazier.   Oh, no. Oh, God, they're actually pulling it off. Oh my God. Well, we've all learned an important lesson. That just because somebody's gay doesn't mean they're gonna molest children. Straight people do that too.  WAAAH! Beating off the dog is not appropriate when we have company!  Ah I mean, ever! Beating off the dog is not appropriate ever! No, Stan! What you were doing to the dog was-ss sexual. Well, ''you'' know, when you do that to a m-male... the... eh eh you make his... ''stuff'' come out.  Well, ''Jesus'', haven't they taught you these things at school?! Yeah! Let's get that damned school on the phone!  What?  Stanley, your mother's a little freaked out right now. Why don't you go play with your big brown package from Afghanistan outside?  Hey, Sh- Sharon? Ha- have you seen Stan in the last couple... days? Oh okay.  I dunno, it was going so fast I couldn't see it.  But I want one. Oh, man, it that the IT? Well, yeah, but I have one question about the way it works. Well,  it seems all the buttons on these front and rear flexigrips are also found on the side of the vehicle.  Well... so... they don't really... do anything. So then, couldn't I just order one that works without going in and out of my ass and mouth?  Hey, uh, Sharon? Isn't that the Williamses? Yeah. You'd become what you hate. They don't think so, Stanley. Your... your friend is terminally ill, and that means.. Well son,... th- that means he's going to be going to heaven soon. Yeah, they're gonna say "shit" on television. Yeah. And they're gonna say "shit"!  Hey, we should all get together and watch it at the bar. Ain't that right?  Yeaaahhh! Are you guys gonna let your kids watch? Oh, sorry, I can't.  They're gonna say "shit" on ''Cop Drama'', and my mom and dad say I have to watch it with them so that I don't take it the wrong way.  Uh, Ms. Choksondik, eh, can we say it in the expletive? Like, "Oh, shit," or, "shit on a shingle"? Hey, fellas! Boy, am I glad to see you guys! There's lots of kids here from other schools, and I don't know anybody. Yeah, well, he's the coolest kid with disabilities in the world! Oh, well, here he is.  We can't tell you.  Hey! Why don't we have Jimmy do some stand-up comedy? Like at our bake sale, very much? Uh yeah, ah I think so. Me neither.  Uh this feller David Blaine. He's doin' magic tricks. Hey, where'd you get that ice cream? I don't think I'm very happy. I always fall asleep to the sounds of my own screams.  And then I always get woken up in the morning by the sounds of my own screams. Do you think I'm unhappy?  Hoh, jeez, eh it sure got cold in here. Ha-I'm not Kyle, I'm Butters. I thought you were Kyle. Wuh what are you gonna do? Wow, yuh-you guys ore gonna see Terrance and Phillip Live? Hoh. Hoh boy, oh boy!  We're waitin' in line for the-ah spook house. Well we wanna see the spook house. Uh well, we paid twenty-nine ninety five; we should be able to go in the spook house.  Oh, jeez. Ah I don't wanna get the AIDS, fellas. Uh what are we gonna do, huh? Ha-I'll be nine next week. Fifty?? Uh, can't we just use the same one every day? Nope. It looks like you're just supposed to roll it over your wiener.  "If used properly, latex condoms are effective against pregnancy, AIDS and other studzes" How the heck should I know?  Hoh- it's all gooey. Ha-a how come I gotta go first? Ma-a-a-a-a-a alright, man.  O-o-o-o-h, it's sticky. I don't even understand how this thing... ooh, wait. Oh, I see.  But it won't ''stay'' on. I- I need a rubber band or somethin'.  Ow! There. Okay, I think it's on. ...Pretty good. Yeah, there ain't nothin' that's gettin' in my wiener through this thing? A-and it's even got a little reservoir at the end so you can... pee in it.  Uh, me?? Huh, what the heck am ''I'' supposed to say?  Just walk away. You can put a stop to all this. Just walk away and we will spare your lives. Just walk away.  How's it goin', fellas? Huh, well, I'm just standin' around bein' a kid. Why? How come you're all wearing those spooky spaceman masks? What?!  Oh, Jesus! I don't wanna get the 'thrax, fellas! Uh, what do I do? Stop breathin'? Well. Alright, then.   Um-me?? Huh but I didn't do nothin'. But, buut, but but what hey! Wait a minute!   Bu-but Teacher, I didn't mean to look stupid in my picture. Honest! I tried to make a good picture. Honest. My mom?  Oh, sweet Jesus!  W-what? Ahah-I can't, fellas. Ah-I'm grounded for lookin' stupid in my school picture. Huh, but I told you mom: ah-I didn't mean to look... like a jackass, eh. It just happened. No! That's just what I look like. See? I'm not makin' a face, mom! Another week?  I hate my stupid face.  Hehyeah? Aw gee, thah-at sounds swell, fellas, but I can't go 'cause I'm still havin' behavioral problems. Uh, my parents are makin' me wear this paper bag until I learn... to stop makin' silly faces all the time. They've really had it up to  here with me.  I sure am, Dad!  Thanks, Dad! Ah I'm sorry I was bad- Hububut Dad, ah I didn't lick a- I'm not ''wearin' '' makeup Dad! I uh-  ...And so, just like in nature, ah I can add the mixture into the volcano and...  Aw, it's all uh g-gooey. Ah, thank you, Ms. Choksondik!  I got a check. That's like a C! Yeah. And their own sprinkler system. You don't think you're rich?  They sure do.  Heh yeah, later, puss.  Hehehey, fellas! Ah, hey fellas! Eric says you gotta come to his house right away. Oh, ah, well, he knew you'd say that, so, he told me to tell you that you don't wanna miss this. Yeah, he ah knew you'd say that, too, so he said t'say, uh, up your ass, Jew.  Yeah. Oh, it's all sticky.   Uh, yeah? Eh, just about. Oh. Well, uh okay.  Right.  Uh hello? Is this Mr. Thompson with Anatomy Research? ...Yes, uh, hello sir. Uh, aah, we have a surplus of unborn fetuses that we think you can use for a ...dissection study. Uh huh, ah, how much do you pay for that? ...You're breaking my balls. ...I said, you're breaking my balls, Mr. Thompson. ...My, my balls. Heh-alright, Mom, I'm all done wrappin' Dad's anniversary present for ya. It's a-  I can't tell you. Uh, but it's really nifty. Bennigan's?? Oh, boy, you mean it??  Four days? Oh, I don't know how I'm gonna wait that long!  That's me.  That's me. .  Three more days till we eat at Bennigan's. That's s-seventy-two hours. Aw gee whiz.  We won't know until we're at Bennigan's. Dad's a good shopper all right. You mean, spy on him? Uh but... ain't that kind of like... fibbin'? Sure I do!   Uh, that's me!  Hm. Dad's going to see a movie. How nice.  "White Swallow Bath House"  Uh, that's me! I'm back, Ma! I sure did.  Dad sure had a nice night out. Well first, he went to see a movie. I don't know. But it wasn't the movie theater at the mall. No, it was that, really old theater downtown. The Studcat.  "Fisting Firemen 9"  I've never seen 1 through 8. Uh but it must have been a real short movie, though, because Dad came out, like, ten minutes later. ...And it must have been a sad film, too, because, he had a bunch of tissue paper with him when he came out. Poor old Dad, the movie really got to him. To the gym. Yeah. The White Swallow Spa. Yep. He went in there and wrestled with all kinds o' guys. He wasn't too good, though. This one black guy had him pinned down for fifteen minutes straight! Inspector Butters gets all the facts. I even got some neato pictures.  Oh, did you have a nice "trip," Mom? See you next "fall." Hahaha, yo- Ma?  Uh, that's me! Hm. Uh-I can't think of one.  Should I go see what he gets you again, Mom? Hey, a new paint brush. That's what Dad could get Mom for their anniversary. I gotta go tell him.   That's me! One please. Uh thanks!   Dad, you in here? Hello? Eh-anybody in here? Uh, Mr. Garrison?  Dad? Oh, uh, pardon me, sirs.  Hi Dad!  I'm glad I found ya. I think I know the perfect anniversary present for Mom. But what are you doin' with your wiener out there, Dad? Oh. Well, alright then. Well, see ya at home.   That's me!  Uh, hey Dad.  Well, sure thing, Dad. Well, I know lying's bad, Dad. Y-you told me so. Little white lies? ...Uh, who's Jack? Oh no, that won't happen, Dad. Eh, no. Because I already told Mom and she's fine. A drive? Oh, boy!  I- I love a good drive. Is Dad comin' too?  Oh boy, a drive! Oh, jeez, you wouldn't have believed how angry I was when Teacher said I had to share my fingerpaints, because I've been sharin' them all along. Well, sure I do, Mom. I love you, too. Oh, you mean like the time you washed my mouth out with soap for sayin' "nutsack" in front of Grandma. Yeah, I need to behave myself. Well, sure, that makes sense, I suppose, yeah. Hey, did you seen my mittens anywhere?  It's cold out here. Oh. Well, alright, Mom. O-o-okay then.  Yep, I'm pretty sure the car is movin'. Looks like I'm headin' for the water.   That's me! Oh, boy! This thing ain't never gonna stop! I must be all the way down to Denver by now.  Wuh gee whiz, where the heck am I?  That's me!  That's me! And so then my friend started hollerin' at me, sayin' "you took my rubber bands." Well, I didn't take 'em, Craig, did. I saw Craig take 'em. Anyway, boy, I sure am lucky you came along, Mister. Oh. Hello? Uh, who is this? Uh, is this the Stotch residence? ...No.  ...No.  That's me! Sir? Hello? Wah I have to get to South Park. Eh, if you give me a ride, I could pay you the four dollars I made at the titty bar. I can't wait till Sunday. I'm eating with my family at Bennigan's tomorrow. Uh will I eventually get to South Park if I follow this road?   and they're gonna be awful sad if I'm not there with 'em. Oh jeez.   That's me! Happy Anniversary! Oh.  Alright, then. I- Ah, I'm sorry. The car just rolled into the lake, and it floated all the way down the river. I tried callin' home, but it was- I ain't grounded, am I? Lie? Hey, you stop hollerin'! It's your anniversary. Uh stop it, Mom and Dad. Now gosh darn it, you!  Well I ain't in trouble for hollerin' at ya, am I? ...Well ah, I'm happy you're alive too, Mom. So now can we go to Bennigan's?  Yeah! Yeah!   wait, what? Uh, k-kill me? Uh Jesus Christ! Yeah. Boy, you fellas are sure gonna rip on me at school now. I really wish I didn't know that stuff. I guess I learned that sometimes, lying can be for the best. Yup. Oh well, when I want a chipotle bleu cheese bacon burger at Bennigan's, I forget all about my dad... bein' queer and my mom tryin' to kill me. I'm gonna be okay. Naw, I'm lyin' Wuh comin', Dad!   That's me!  Oh, I bet this is it! Here it comes. And so, children, instead of saying "Hand in your papers," I may now say, "Hand in your shit." Any questions? No! No, Filmore! You can say "I have to poop and shit," or "Oh, shit, I have to poop," but not "I have to shit." Are we all clear? ''Hey, there, shitty shitty fag fag,<br>Shitty shitty fag fag, how do you do?<br>Hey, there,-'' Hey, watch it, ''fag''. I called you a fag. Because I'm gay, and that means I'm free to use the word "fag". So piss off, you fag-shitter!  Well, they can't use "fag". Because you can't say "fag" unless you're a homosexual. No. See, you got beeped. That's right. Well, well, well! Guess we learned something new about ''you'', Jimbo, you frickin' fag! You wanna make out or something? Oh boy, this show is really reaching for plot now! Is this still part of the show? Hey, you're the guy on the screen.  Eric, that is a lot of money. Don't you think you should keep it in the bank instead of at your house? Okay, children, who can tell me what a condom is?  Yes, Jenny? That's a con-''dor'', Jenny. Con-dor.  Yes, Filmore? NO, we can't do fingerpaint! You kids wanna get herpes?! Huh?! How about a nice bucket of AIDS?! Sound good?! Now pay attention, alright? I'm going to show you the proper way to put ''on'' a condom.  And it's as simple as that. Any questions? Okay, children, now I wanna review the different sexual positions. Who can tell me which sexual positions we talked about?  Missionary position, good. A little boring, but tried and true. What else?  That's right. Doggie style we went over, mhm.  Uh huh, pile driver position. Good, Quaid.  Yes, good Flora, you remembered the Filthy Sanchez.  Yes,you can give your partner the ol' Hot Karl, sure. Jesus Christ.  Wha? Why did you pan to me just now? What the hell is ''that'' s'posed to mean? Okay children, so what other sexual positions have we talked about? Yeah, the wrap-around butt grab. Sure, can't forget that. Uh huh, reverse cowgirl. Good, Kevin. Hot Lunch, sure, she likes that. Donkey Punch, uh huh. Glass-bottom boat. Good one, yes. Fish-eye. Good, Jenny. Chili dog. Mm-hm. What the?  Oh alright, have your way with me if you must! Go on, fulfill you sick pleasures!  Huh where are you goin'? Wow, I never realized Ben had TPS, but I definitely see the resemblance now.  Jesus Christ, these lines are ridiculous! I'm gonna miss my flight!  E- Excuse me, there are two other security checkpoints. Why can't you open those, too? But you work for the-  uh, God-damnit!! Oh, I feel like I've run a marathon.  What? Well of ''course'' I didn't make it. The line to check in was two hours long, and the security line was two hours more! I can't go tomorrow, the Jizzfest is tonight! This is unbelievable! You know, I seem to remember when the airlines said, "We need a 15 billion dollar bailout from the taxpayers-"!  Well we ''gave'' them the 15 billion dollar bailout and they fired their employees anyway! So now we have three people to clear 400 passengers! So where did that money go? I'll ''tell'' you where it went: it went into the pockets of the presidents and CEOs of the airlines, so they can keep their multimillion-dollar salaries! You think you can treat us however you want because we HAVE to fly! Well I'll tell you what, Sally Sassalot, I'm gonna come up with a NEW mode of transportation! A ahah brand new vehicle that'll put ''all'' you bastards out of business! You think I can't do it?! I got a master's degree in mechanical engineering at Denver Community College! You watch me!!  Come on, everybody! Now it's got to be simple. Like a moped, but with the ability to travel at much faster speeds. The designs of our electrical moped were altered with a- no, nonono this won't work either! It has to be more stable, Mr. Hat! A moped would be too dangerous at those speeds. Damnit!  Now, what if the jet power of an aircraft could be scaled down into a personal vehicle? Oh, Mr. Hat! Would you stop drooling over Enrique Iglesias and... wait a minute. What did you say? That's it. Gyration.  It's so simple and yet genius! We've done it, Mr. Hat. Airline companies be damned. We've invented a whole new mode of transportation! Get some investors on the phone!  Well what are you waiting for?! Gentlemen, imagine being able to travel safely at incredibly fast speeds, and not having to go to the stupid fartface airports! It IS incredible, Mr. Hat. And what makes IT possible  Gentlemen, I give you, IT! IT gets over 300 miles to the gallon, and is safely capable of speeds of over 200 miles per hour.  ...there we go. Now, the final flexigrip is directly in front of the driver so that its small switches can be operated with the mouth, as such.  Okay, now you're just gonna feel a little pinch. It's alright, it's just locking you in.  ''We're in the money, Mr. Hat, We're in the money, Mr. Hat... [Jimbo, holding his lower back, walks up to Mr. Garrison]'' Oh hi, Jimbo. Can I help you?  Oh, right, right. Take a seat.  What do you think, Mr. Marsh? All set to put a down payment on that baby? Sure. Yeup. Right.  Excuse me, what the hell are you doing? Shutting me down? Why? Yeah, well that was the point, dingleberry! Ah-t put that down! OH, GOD-DAMNIT! You'd better be kidding!  THE AIRLINE COMPANIES ARE LOSING MONEY BECAUSE OF THEIR OWN INCOMPETENCE AND THEIR OWN INEFFICIENCY!! HWAAAAHHH! Airline motherfuckerrrs! You pieces of shiiit! Cocksucking sons of bitch airlines!  Look, there's ''more'' of them moving into our town.  You know, Oprah Winfrey is building a house up on Cannon, and some Snoop Doggy Doo Doo buildin' a gigantic place up on Main. That's the fifth family of them that's moved here. Seems like all of a sudden South Park is being overrun by those types.  Oh, yeah, and it won't be long before they drove all of us poor underachieving people out of town with inflated real-estate costs! Yeah.  Yeah. Hey, hey, you guys know why richers have such big garages? 'Cause they need a place for all their Porsches and boats and aircraft carriers!   Those richers are getting snooty. We've got to show those richers they're not welcome here! How about tonight, we sneak up to one of their houses, and right on their lawn we'll set fire to a big lowercase "t"! Yeah, for "time to leave"! Jimbo, you take some folk and build a big wooden lowercase "t"! I'll take the rest and get some gas and torches ready! Alright!  T is for "time to leave," cashchucker! Now, come on! Is that any way to talk? No! We just haven't scared them the right way! Think about it. What scares rich people more than anything?  Bingo! Rich people don't want to live in South Park if they think it's HAUNTED! Everyonen get some sheets from home! If we can't chase the richers out, we'll ''spook'' 'em out! That's great! And now we can sell all their homes, and become... millionaires! Well yeah, but at least I got rid of all those damn ni- And so, we will all miss Kenny, his playful laughter, his innocent smile. But we will never forget that it was because of brave Kenny that stem-cell research was allowed to continue.  Well, that's four fingers; try five. ...Who is that?!  Listen, Mitchell, I put my life on the line every day. How dare you accuse ''me''! I'm doing my job, Frank! We have to know where that evidence was shipped! Maybe... maybe protect them from you? And maybe you're forgetting I used to be a cop, too! That's it, I've had enough of this. I said, enough! Just understand that it's my job. I still think you're a good cop. You're right. Maybe I'll see you around. Oh, yeah, thanks, thanks. Oh, was that it? Was that it?!  They did it! Well, that's not fair! ''I'' should be able to say "fag".  Uh oh. There he is! Kill him! Kill him!  Kern.  O-kay. Huh??  Uh, I don't feel nothin'.   Yes! Oh my God!  Eric! Are you training that pony to please you? Oh. Well, does Mr. Denkins know you're usin' his pony? He shoots trespassers on sight, you know. Alright, then.  Wait, why the hell are you trainin' Denkins' pony to bite off someone's penis? Well, son, I think you have a pretty stupid plan there. Look, if you wanna get revenge on somebody, you've gotta think like a hunter.  Step 1: Find someone's weakness. Step 2: Exploit that weakness.  No, young hunter. I mean, what do you see? You must learn all you can about your kill. Ooh, what's a Radiohead? Oh, Jesus, don't start singing, Ned! Nice thinking, young hunter. What? What?! Give me those!  Holy crow, he's right, Ned! Mrs. Tenorman's lettin' the twins out! Dear God, they're bigger than I ever imagined! Here you go.  Wow, those are great. Maybe I should go grab some beers, Ned. Ned, what- a-are you jackin' it? Well, stop it!   Oh crap!  Ned, for Christ's sake, stop jackin'! Damn, Ned, I've never seen that much cash. On what? Yeah, I wanted to order that theft alarm for my IT. Uh, that's okay, I'll stand. Yep, there goes the neighborhood.  Oh. I don't take kindly to rich folk. Neither does Ned. I remember back in the day, RICH folk weren't alLOWED in South Park! Now thery're movin' here in droves! Yeah. How many rich people does it take to screw in a light bulb? None! They can hire people to do it ''for'' them!  I guess we showed them! Lowercase "t"? Yeah. Next house we'll do a ''capital'' T, to show 'em we REALLY mean business! I guess we learned our lesson: you can't fight rich folk; they're just too powerful. ...Ghosts? But then you had us do all that for nothin'. Don't you see: If you get rich sellin' these homes, then there will still be rich people in South Park. I told you, we don't have a record of that. And besides, - - your job is to protect the men who serve this force. Maybe you're forgetting who you're talking to! Yeah? You used to be a lot of things. Don't you turn your back on me, you! Is it? Will it... ever be enough? Well, Mitchell. I guess you're goin'ta do what you're gonna do. Let's just try and stay friends no matter what. Goodbye. Oh, and Mitchell?  You've got some shit on the side of your mouth right there. Oh, he doesn't know that Mitchell slept with his wife, does he?  He's able to use comedy to overcome his handicap! I love him!  Ike, eat your gefilte fish.  That's nice, Kyle. Ike, eat! Well, it's nice to see you so interested in something, Kyle. Ike, for the love of Abraham, you are gonna eat this. Magic Camp? I don't know, bubbe, ask your father.  Ike, you will eat this! Ah-ah-ah-I'm afraid Kyle can't ride any amusement park rides for over a year because of his horrible hemorrhoid. Kyle, don't say such things! Kyle, we wanna tell you about the Book of Job. It's a story from the Bible.  But one day, Satan went up to Heaven and talked to God. Yes, in the Book of Job, Satan talks to God. And God says to Satan, "Have you seen Job? He is a great man, and he praises me every day." To which God said, "Oh yeah? I'll show you, Satan! I'll take those things away from Job and he will still praise my name." Then God sent his fireballs from the sky and killed his sheep and the rest of his employees.  Job was terribly sad, but he fell to his knees and said, "The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away," and praised God's name.  He was in terrible, miserable pain all day, every day. But he still kept his faith.  Basically. Isn't he getting any better, doctor?  Get the doctor! But then... are you saying...?  Oh Kyle! Kyle, you've got to fight!  That's it, baby. That's it.  From the school. It's easier to just leave it up to the school, but it's...just not a school subject. So you mean 17 as long as you're in love? That's your cousin's flight, Kyle. Hold the sign up nice and high so he can find us. He's your age and about your height. Oh, there he is.  How was your flight?  You remember Uncle Gerry.  And these are your cousins, Ike and Kyle. Let's get down to the baggage claim, Kyle.   Here we go, Kyle Two.  Oh, I'm so sorry, Kyle. What else can I fix you? Nonsense. Can't I make you some nice pasta? Or a frozen fish fillet?  Yes, Kyle Two? He's your cousin, Kyle Two. I told you already. He's my sister's son. That makes him your first cousin. Now Kyle Two, listen to me. Kyle is going through a very tough time in his life. His mother is very sick and he's in a whole new place. He's going to rely on you to make sure he fits in at your school. I'm sure your friends will love him. Kyle Two, he's your responsibility. I'm sure you two will become great friends with lots of late night pillow talk. Kyle Two, where is Kyle? Where on earth could he be?   What? Don't be ridiculous, Kyle Two. He's out playing with his new friends.  Kyle, what happened to you?? Oh you poor thing! Come upstairs and we'll get you out of those wet clothes.  Are you alright? Oh, it's been days! Where can he be? I'm gong to call the police again. Kyle Two, go down to the playground and look there.  You're back! Now that things have changed for Kyle, his mother needs him back. I don't get it. He must pull in at least two hundred thousand a year.  I'm going to go take the boys to go see him at the hospital, Eric. We thought you might wanna come. ''Cop Drama'' will return after these messages.  Get ready for "Must Shit TV"! Starting now, four straight hours of pure shit! It's all live! And now, back to Must Shit TV, here on HBC. And now, ladies and gentlemen, David Blaine.  Ladies and gentlemen, may we have silence, please, as magician David Blaine will now eat... his... own... head.   And so ends "Punky Brewster, Behind The Blow." To order tickets, call TicketSlave NOW!!  Ladies and gentlemen!  And now back to ''Money Quest'', on HBC.  IT comes in sizes for the entire family.  Order yours today and remember our slogan: IT's better than flying. Uh!  Wow!!! Yeah! Whoa!!! Hey Chef. Oh. Yay! All right! Aaaahh!  Aaagh!  Awww! Waaah! Oh!! Whoa! Last night, the daring and bold show, ''Cop Drama'' [''title screen pops up''], broke new ground by saying "Shit!" on television, making "shit" officially okay to say around the country.  Rick Watts has the story. Thanks, Tom. Shit is certainly going down here in the small town-  Whoa, shit! Thanks, Chris. In other news, the FBI has finally caught the child molester known as Mr. Slippyfist.  This sick child molester was found with disturbing graphic photos of young boys naked, which we will show you now.  Here's one. And here's another. Here, look at this one. Sick sonofabitch! Here's one right here. Alright, children, in lieu of the common usage, I'm s'posed to clarify the school's position on the word, "shit". Yes, but only in the figurative noun form or the adjective form. You can only use it in the non-literal sense. For instance,  The adjective form is now also acceptable. For example:  That's right out! Very good, Timmy. Yes, that's now fine.  Boys, watch your language! Shit!  and I'm pleased to announce that the national Earth Day organization has chosen South Park as its location for the Earth Day Brainwashing Festival. The heads of the Earth Day Brainwashing organization are here to tell you all about it.  I'm sorry, boys, but nothing's more important than Earth Day. Naive at what cost, Chef? Parents, we have to face facts: Children in America are having sex at younger and younger ages. STDs are affecting younger and younger kids all the time. The only way we can combat that is by educating children before they have sex. Alright girls, even though this may be stuff you don't want to hear, you need to hear it. Fun! It's going to be fun! Well let's start with our first lesson, then, shall we?  That's right, because unless you get boys to wear condoms you can and will get a sexually transmitted disease from them! How fun is that, hmmm?! Is that fun? Today over 20,000 Americans will contract a sexual disease! TODAY! Twelve thousand more tomorrow! And the reason is that you girls wake up in the morning and say, "It's not going to happen to me." You say, "Oh, Ms. Choksondik, that happens to girls in Detroit, in Brooklyn, but not here in Colorado." WRONG!  Wrong! Sex is about disease! Here's a little picture of herpes. And here's a little syphilis for you! That's right, girls. Here's what happens when you don't get boys to use condoms! Oh, it's no problem, Mr. Mackey. It's probably best we come up with a lesson plan together anyway.  Well we should make sure our students are good and scared of the consequences. We have to teach them that diseases are possible even with just oral sex.  Using your mouth on the penis or vagina. It's just too bad these girls are having sex so young. Did I what? Well, if you must know, I'm still somewhat of a virgin.  The only boyfriend I ever had was this attractive popular boy named Steven Garrett. I liked him very much, but I... found out that he was dating me because he lost a bet on the Super Bowl. The loser had to go out with me for three days.  People can be very cruel. Anyway, I know it's hard to understand. Your nickname? ...Right. Wow, I've... never met a man who is... as sexually unappealing as me.  Well, I'm quite happy without sex. I mean, with all the diseases and problems out there, who needs it, right? Well, back to the lesson plan, then. Okay.  "Oral Sex" I knew it! Well, at least we scared them enough to protect themselves. But now maybe you'll believe me when I say that we need to be teaching even younger than fourth grade. ...Kindergarten. We've got to get to the students before they start having... sex. Nu-not after. Alright girls. Yesterday we went over the myriad of diseases you can get from boys, but today we're going to talk about the most horrible they can give you of all.   I've already gone through that with the girls.  It's pretty simple. Do you wanna drink?  Or the... shaft... of the penis?  Why, yes. The nerve endings are the most concentrated at- the- tip of the penis. Like they are in the...  clitoris of the woman. Sexual stimulation.  Oh, is this wrong? Yeah? What do you do when you think about me? Do you touch yourself?  Haawww. Haawww. Oh my God. Oh God, yeah! Stop! Stop! It's your turn.   Do you want me? Tell me. Wait wait wait! Do you have a condom?  Woh.  Ooh, that's it baby! That's it! Did you feel something? I'm afraid this is all my fault. I... think I went a little overboard scaring the girls. I forgot to tell them that to get diseases from boys you... have to have sex with them first. He's right. I never knew how special and personal sex was un... until just recently. Alright class, as some of you may have heard, the President has asked that American children all send one dollar to the children of Afghanistan.  So I have a list of addresses and we're goin' to all chip in. Eric, the Afghan people need our help! Alright, children, we are ''all'' sending a dollar to the kids in Afghanistan! That's it! End of discussion! Next in line! Come on, let's keep it moving, kids!  Kyle, we're taking pictures without hats today! Alright, class, I have your school photos to hand out- ''Most'' of them are very nice. But, apparently, ''one'' of you thinks it's fun to ''spoil'' their school pictures , and thinks he's a comedian. That person will be spending the afternoon in the principal's office! School photos aren't for joking around, so you aren't getting your photo ''back'', Butters!  For the rest of you, I think your pictures turned out very nicely. Eric, calm down. I'm trying to yell at Butters! You know very well my name isn't Chokesonrocks, it's Choksondik! Say it right or you can go to the principal's with Butters! Your mother is waiting for you in the principal's office.  And I know you'll all be very nice to our new student.  Kyle, why don't you tell us a little about yourself? Okay, why don't you go ahead and take a seat, Kyle?  Yes, unfortunately the school seems to be completely out of extra desks. So you'll just have to share with your cousin.  Now let's get on with our lesson on the-  Now let's get back to the le-  Now Kyle, I need you to be quiet. In my class you need to be able to concentrate. Concentration is the key to succeeding in my class. Okay, good job, Butters. You get a check. Okay. Whose project should we look at next? How aboouuut Eric?  Eric Cartman? NOW Eric! You just put that thing together just now! I'm giving you a check minus. Siddown.  What did you say?! Alright, Tolkien, you're next.  Very very good, Tolkien. You get a check plus.   Now, uh, before we get started, Stan and Kyle? Uh, the principal needs to see you in her office. She needs to see you now!  Sss...sss... Hyeah Timmay! Timmay!  Timmay! Ji- Jimmay?  Timmy.    Yahahah!!! Ah.   Tiiimm-mmah!!!!!  Timmih. Hur livin' a lah, Timmih.  Timmih!  Tim-Timmy. Timmih!   Tim-Timmay!  Timmay. Timmih!  Timmih! Timmih! Timmih! Timmih!  Timmih! Timmay!  Timmay!  Timmih. Timmih. Timmih, Timmih. Haaa. Timmih. Hahnah Timmih. Hahnah Timmih. Timmih! Lah-livin' a lie! Timmih. Tim-mih.  Uh, Timmih.  Tim-mih.  Timmay! Timmay! Euuh, livin' a lie, Timmih.  Timmay! Timmehah! What about, "I have to take a shit"? Can we do fingerpaint?  Miss'nary position? No. Why that store has such lovely shit. Yeah.  Oh, looks like the weather might turn shitty. Okay, parents. I know a lot of you want a chance to speak, but we have to talk one at a time. School policy has been to teach sexual education later. In the fifth grade. Teachers, I have some bad news. Last night I received a phone call from the local pharmacist. Apparently, almost all of our fourth graders are sexually active. And now that we've scared them a little they're buying condoms to use. But how old do you think a student should be when they learn about proper condom use? I guess we have no choice. Then it's decided: no more condom classes in grade school. Hello, boys. Oh, I don't really give a shit. I've done enough shit outside today and shit. Sh. We're watching "Behind the Blow," m'kay. Okay, boys, this is the first day of sexual education, m'kay? Now, I know that some of you think this is very funny. Words like "penis" and "vagina."  let's see, the man takes his penis, and he... hm. Well, sure I have! It's just... I was about 19 at the time, so it's been about 21 years... m'kay. Let's see, uh...  I'm pretty sure I took th-yeah I took the penis, and I bu- uh, what the hell did I do with that damned thing?? Uh thanks so much for letting me come over, Ms. Choksondik. Yeah I've already gone over most of the basics, you know, uh with the boys, but I uh... eh just wanted to see what else you were teaching the girls, in case I... "missed" anything. Right! Oral sex, which of course would be... Penis or vagina, right. Oral sex, m'kay. Yeah, why d-uh, did you? Well uh, how long did ''you'' wait before you had... uh... doobers. Oh, I'm... I'm sorry. Ah actually I understand perfectly. I... I wasn't exactly the captain of the football team, either, huh huh, hehehuh,  "That guy with the really big head." Anyway, I... I sort of lost any confidence and found it impossible to ever ask a woman out, mm, hm mm. Neither have I. Uh not me!  Huhuh, okay. Right.   This is where the man puts his- Eric, what the hell are you doing? Why are you wearing a condom? Eric, you can't get AIDS from just sitting around, you have to get it from sex. Yes. Yes! Now will you all pay attention, please?! The vagina and the clitoris are on the outside, and they are in fact very easily visible to the naked eye. Now here we can see the interior female anatomy. Things like the uterus and the ovaries are on the inside And here we see the tender, magical uterus. Here we see the enticing, voluptuous Fallopian tubes, m'kay. M'kay, so apparently the lesson plan tomorrow is s'posed to involve the secretion of bodily fluids, m'kay. Why, sure.  Uh, maybe we should come up with another lesson plan. Uh, right, right, uh, like in the ...nipples. It... says here that the uh, head of the penis is actually the... most sensitive... part, m'kay. And these... are the two areas most important to- I don't know. It doesn't feel wrong.  I've been thinking about you a lot, Ms. Choksondik. I go crazy. Yeah. Hmm.  G'oh, m'kay. Huh, what's wrong? Mm, oh, oh Ms. Choksondik. M' kay! M'kay! I do. I want you. M'kay.  Well. No. Oh yeah. Woh.   Okay Eric, as your counselor, uh I want you to feel comfortable talking about anything, m'kay? Well, I can't think of anything that would be THAT funny. Oh, I see, well... Well, what did you ''used'' to think was funny? Well Eric, I suppose that, just like everything else, laughter can be relative - in, in other words, sometimes people see somethin' so scary that nothin' else scares them, so, the same could be true for funny things. It's possible, hm'kay? . Ohokahay, huhuh.  We know, and that's why he's going to need you boys to be strong for him, m'kay? He needs you now more than ever. Shit, Peter, you look like shit.  That's what you said about Peterson, and then you ended up having sex with him! Jim-my! Jim-my! Jim-my! Jim-my Uh, Hooray! O-hoho!  It's Jesus!  Next!  Yes? The pube fair? There's no such thing, you little smartass!  It's alright, darling, they're just Canadian. Hold it!  Step... away... from the towel!  Hey, he's right!  Can I get on that 7:30 a.m. flight? Oh. Well, I guess we can always... just make another one.  There, do you think that works? No, shit, I ''feel'' like shit. I think I- Holy shit! Did you see ''that'' shit?  We're not going to the abortion clinic. I'm going to have this baby. Oh Mark, I love you. What kind of shit is this?  Hello? Who is this? Yes. Are you calling about the abduction? Oh. Well, are you Puerto Rican? We need to keep this line clear. Call back another day.  It wasn't the abductors, sorry. That is some weird shit.  Awww. Huh?  Come on, Kobe, let's just go. Susan, your shit's ready! Do you know where this shit goes?   That's right. Cover! Cover!  Whazzat? Shit if I know.  You did. Wha- what did you- what did he say? Nice going, shit-for-brains. ''Old McDonald took a shit, E I E I O'' What? No shit! Just let 'em have it out, Susan. They'll run out of steam soon.   What's goin' on?   What did you call me?  Some kind of gay pride rally. Alright, boys, break it up. ...Seventy-five share. My God, I never thought it was possible. Thanks, Roger, but I've only just started. You see, I've already figured out our ''new'' marketing scheme technique for the ''next'' run of shows.  "shit" ...twice. Well gentlemen, let's get on it! Gentlemen, I have it. The end-all greatest marketing ploy of all time.  Tonight, on HBC, we will air all our sitcoms... LIVE. And have everyone say "shit" in place of their written lines. And we'll call it "Must Shit TV". Now, doing this live will be difficult, so we must-  Who are you?  Oh brother, another Christian protest group. Alright, now, as I was saying- Aw, are they still here? Do you have any proof of this? Then  get out of here before we have you ''thrown'' out! Alright, now, we have to get all our biggest names to say "shit", and then we're gonna-  Oh...  No, you guys didn't hire me a stripper for my birthday- oh, tell me you guys didn't. I never said I was. Security!  This is it. My greatest work. What the? What is going on here?! Stop this shit! Listen, Mr. Shinypants, I am the head of this network, and I will say "shit" all I want! Shit, shit, shit shit shit, shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit, <br>Oh, shit! I didn't know.  I didn't know!!! We're sorry, noble knights of Standards and Practices.  From now on, we will obey your laws.  What's the new idea? Where is the roof on this thing? I mean, I mean, how can we top ourselves now?  Bravo! Who wants to take this one? My, my GOD, sir! What have you unleashed upon the world?!  Sir, I'd just like to take this opportunity: And, I'm sure I speak for all of us when I say, you are the most creative genius in Hollywood, and... well... I'd let you have me if you wanted. "Night Of A Million Shits!" I'll get it.  Whoa! I can hardly wait.   Twice! It's like saying it once... but double! He's unstoppable! Brilliant! Hm, right, right. I'm about to piss myself! The ratings are in, sir. We broke another record last night with the show that said "shit" seven times!  Think of the repetition! Ho!  Treason! treason! ''Baby you are so fine, and shit!<br>The shit you do, the shit you say; I'd jump on your shit any day!<br>[the boys walk in]'' Oh, hello there, children. Uh, from your ass, children. Oh. The Black Death? Are you sure? LaToya Jackson, children. But I think back in those days it meant something else: the plague! It says here the word, "shit" has been around for over 600 years. It comes from the Anglo-Saxon word, "skite". The Black Plague. Over half of Europe was killed by it. Look at this, children.  It says that the people in England believed that the plague was a curse, a dark magic infliction brought on by a mass utterance of a ''word'' of curse. Of course! I've never even thought about why we use the term "curse word" before. Children, we've got to warn those producers in Hollywood that the plague, and "shit", could be linked! Hold on a minute, Mr. Producer! My name is Chef, and these are the children! We've come to warn ''you'' about "shit". Hey! Hold on a minute! Haven't you people noticed all the strange things going on?  Damn cracker-ass producers! I don't know, children. I guess we've got to get the word out to people some other way. Who are you? We've got to find people who would know what the hell this is all about. Children, we're goin' to have to go to the land of castles, knights, and kings! 'Scuse me. Do you work here? We just need help identifying this.  Uh, yeah. We didn't mean to. But I don't get it. People use curse words all the time. Knights of Standards and Practices? Oh no! Tonight is the "Night of a Million Shits" on HBC! It's gonna be said over and over! I'm very proud of you, children. Let's all go home and find a nice white woman to make love to. Hello, Eric! I made some chili to enter into the contest. This is a chili cook-off, ain't it? It's my special recipe. Look, parents. Do you really want your children learning about sex? Part of the fun of being a kid is being naive! Let them be kids for a while. The first thing that kids learn about sex shouldn't be some bitch-scare tactic about STDs. Hello there, children. How is sexual education class going? Yeah, I don't think Ol' Mackey knows a hymen from a hysterectomy. And Choksondik? I'd be surprised if she's ''ever'' gotten laid in her life. ...Oh, nothin'. Now, move along, children, you're holdin' up the line. Kindergarten?! Aw, now this is getting ridiculous! Oh, no! Well, I hate to say it, but you all got what you deserved. Look: Schools are teaching condom use to younger and younger students each day! But sex isn't something that should be taught in textbooks and diagrams. Sex is emotional and spiritual. It needs to be taught by family. I know it can be hard, parents, but if you leave it up to the schools to teach sex to kids, you don't know ''who'' they're learning it from. It could be from someone who doesn't know,  It's very simple, children. The right time to start having sex is... 17. Seventeen. Nope, just 17. Seventeen! You're ready.  ''Shovel that snow, babih, it's all nice, heavy and wet. Just- [he hears voices and spins around. A group of rich folk are marching in protest]'' For what? But... I'm not rich. I'm just a school cafeteria chef. Ahah I don't make much money. Woo, fudge the snow now.  ''[with the others] I shall perservere. We shall perservere.'' Children, Kenny has been diagnosed with a... terminal disease. Oh, isn't that nice? You've got lots of friends, don't you Kenny?  Hello there, children. How's it goin'? Yeah. Things have been better.  Stan, sometimes God takes those closest to us, because it makes him feel better about himself. He is a very vengeful God, Stan. He's all pissed off about something we did thousands of years ago. He just can't get over it, so he doesn't care who he takes. Children, puppies, it don't matter to him, so long as it makes us sad. Do you understand. Well, look at it this way: if you want to make a baby cry, first you give it a lollipop. Then you take it away. If you never give it a lollipop to begin with, then it would have nothin' to cry about. That's like God, who gives us life and love and help just so that he can tear it all away and make us cry, so he can drink the sweet milk of our tears. You see, it's our tears, Stan, that give God his great power.    Hello, ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. If you look out the right side of the aircraft you can see some interesting shit.   Aaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh. Stand aside!  Halt your evil plans! I possess the Rune Stone of Undoing! Who is in charge here?  Show your true form, Geldon, lest you be afraid! Your short time in this world is at an end!  Ach. The Rune Stone has no effect! You are not Geldon!  Ach!  oh. Take this.  Eeehhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.  Say not the word of curse!  He is too strong! We cannot fight him without the rune stone! The rune stone! Point it towards Geldon!  Huh? Take a free spin. Double your odds.  How can I help you, noble sir? A what? Uh... I can help get you some credit or a comp meal, perhaps. Look kid, This is just a casino. I can't help you. You know, not every British person knows about wizards  and dragons and curses.  The Rune Stone of Gaelic! Where did you get this? The Skire once spoke of such a stone! Come, we must see the sorcerer!  These Americans wish to see the Skire! How could you foolish Americans bring the wrath of scorn by mass-chanting the word of wretchedness?! Didn't you realize "shit" is a curse word?! Ha! Leave it to Americans to think that "no" means yes, "pissed" means angry, and "curse word" means something other than a word that's ''cursed''!! Saying a word of curse once in a while does nothing. It's only when spoken repeatedly and en masse that the curse takes place. Hey! Heh, shit! Heh.  Ya ain't shit. Oh yeah?! Well, I don't really give a shit!  Oh, man, I am up shit creek. Yeah, how could I be such a dumb sh- Yeah. Dude, ya ain't shit!  You know what? You're dumb as shit! Serves you right, shit-for-brains!  Cocktails. Cocktails. Let us make haste to the inner sanctum! I'm sorry, we're no longer taking reservations. Nobody can eat here. You'll have to leave now. Let me see the stone.   I've seen this before. Stones that were used by the Knights of Standards and Practices. A legion of men sworn to do whatever necessary to keep the words at bay. But... they were just a myth. The knights were formed to keep curse words to a minimum. Should a curse word ever be let out, they would return. A rune for each word of curse was made, representing each of the eight words that so offended God... Look at this: The writing here claims this stone can defeat the evil Geldon , who will rise when the word of curse has been said enough times to give him power. Then all the world will be destroyed. What? Then we haven't much time. We must go! Yeah, they're gonna have to come up with a ''new'' swear word soon. You mean you have to be a  fag? Turn off those devices of broadcast! We are the Royal Order of Standards and Practices!  See that you do! We command you to stop saying the curse word! Agh. Dude, lame. Lame!  Kyle. No-oo. I todd a nurra.  Uh huh. Oh, look, Kyle. Your little friend Stan is here to see you. Kyle, y-you-you just don't understand. It's-- Hello, Kyle. How's the hemorrhoid today? Oh, I think you'll see differently after hearing this. Sit down, Kyle.  He was the most upright and honorable of men, and every day he praised God.  But Satan said, "Oh yeah? He only praises you because you gave him so much. If you didn't give him those things, he would curse your name." And so, God had a bunch of barbarians come in and slaughter Job's oxen and donkeys, and murder all his workers.  And then, as Job's sons and daughters were eating, God sent a mighty wind to collapse the house and crush and kill them all.  So then, Job got painful sores all over his body.  God said to Satan, "See? I told you. Job still praises me."  Oh. Uhhh, I don't know. Isn't he responding at all, doctor? But, what if you're not ready at 17? Hey! W-what are you saying? What "types"? They're scared to death! They were so scared, I'm sure they'll never be back! ...He might, Kyle.  Yeah. Well, now, that's part of the fun. You boys just make sure to obey the scout leader now. He's the man in charge. Look! I'm not saying the new scout leader's a bad person, I just don't think he should be a scout leader! He's really, really gay. I have nothing against homosexuals either, Randy, but the big camping trip is next week! Are you sayin' you're fine with this guy campin' overnight, alone, with our boys?? Uh, Kenny, it's nine o'clock. Uh huh! Your wife, huh? Yeah. Now they're acting like men. I heard that. Kenny? Yeah. Why, just this afternoon our son was caught beatin' off our dog.  What the hell was that? Yep, me too. How is it?  Hello scouts! Hello, Stanley. I was happy to see you and your little friends' names on the list!  Hey, are you parents gonna stand there all night? This meeting is for scouts only, you silly gooses.  Now, before we get started, scouts, I want to introduce you to someone very special here tonight. He's a brave little boy with disabilities who proves just by being here that Scouts are for everyone! So let's all give a big round of applause to little... Jimmy!  And so that's how to make banana-nut muffins. And now, as a very special treat, our very special friend Jimmy is going to do what he loves most: Motivational standup comedy.  Oops, guess we're out of time, kids. Now remember, tomorrow you all have bake sales in your respective neighborhoods to raise money. We'll meet back here ''next'' Tuesday, and see who raised the most. Good luck.  I'm super, thanks for asking. The troops are off having bake sales, and I'm pleased to report that we have already raised over $600 for the event. Yippie! Well, stop the presses. Did you figure that out all by yourselves, silly buns?  Out of... Scouts? But I've been in Scouts since I was nine - it's a... huge part of my life. I see... What if I promise not to be gay anymore?  Pinky swear.  Ah, bye, Scouts.  Okay, okay, Marc, stop playing now.   I'm sorry. Sorry. But now I've packed everything away, so just... well, play something uplifting, like... "I'm gonna put all this behind me and make it okay" music. Oh!  Jesus, Marc. Go away! I'm dead!  I can't, kids. I've been... kicked out of Scouts. Really? wull-why? Why not? Boys, there's nothing I can do. The Scouts don't allow homosexuals.  Look, I appreciate what you kids did; I really do. But this isn't what I wanted. I'm proud to be gay. And I'm proud to be in a country where I'm free to express myself. But freedom is a two-way street. If ''I'm'' free to express ''my''self, then the Scouts have to be free to express ''themselves'', too. I know these men. They are good men. They are ''kind'' men. They do what ''they'' think is best for kids. No matter how wrong we think they might be, it isn't right for us to force them to think our way. It's up to us to persuade, and help them see the light, not extort them to. Please, don't cut the Scouts' funding. The Scouts help and have always helped a lot of kids. That's why I ''love'' them. I will continue to persuade them to change their mind, but this is the wrong way to do it. So, I am hereby dropping my case, and allowing the Scouts ''their'' right to not allow gays into their private club.  Hooray!  Gays in Scouts! Gays in Scouts! Gays in Scouts! Gays in Scouts! Hey Chef. Yeah.   WAAAAHHH!!  AAAAAA. Whoa! Aagh! Agh! Oooww!  Awww!  Well hello everyone.  Well how gay is he? Uh the first chapter alone was filled with poetry. Butters? Are you ready to stop with the stupid faces? Alright, you can take the paper bag off. Oh, very funny, young man! You think it's clever to make yourself up like a girl?! Did you use your mother's makeup?! She's gonna be furious! Put that bag back on! Well then, ''I'' don't want ''my'' boy there, either.  You know, boys emulate authority figures. Even if it doesn't turn them gay, they could end up all talk and all fem' and prancin' around like girls.  They're gonna be sending their kids to our schools, and mixin' them with our pure, non-rich kids! Damn, I hate those stupid richers! They've got nice expensive beers for you across the street at the new Wolfgang Puck's. I think we scared 'im. If they get that petition passed, it's all over. They won, Garrison. They can't be scared out of town. It's working! That was it. We just saw the last of them speeding away in a van!  People, people, please! You're forgetting that homosexuality is a choice! As many of you know, I, myself, went through a... homosexual... phase. But the light of Christ showed me how to change. Just give me two hours with this man, and I ''can'' convert him back. Eric, God could sure use that money for a bigger church. Wow, what a great audience.  How about Jimmy Stewart? "Merry Christmas, movie house." And John Travolta. "Oh my God, Mr. Kotter! Mr. Kotter, oh, oh my God, Mr. Kotter!" Gee, sure, that'd be great! Thanks, fellas. See ya tomorrow at the bake sale, fellas. Wow, what a great audience. I just flew into South Park. Boy, are my crutches tired!  Well, I sure have met a lot of interesting people here in South Park.  And how about that school counselor? "Uh, dr-, drugs are b-bad."  Wow, looks like when it comes to comedy, I really t-take the c-keh-c. I really take the cay. I really take the k-keh cake.  Oh, hey Timmy. I'm glad you called, very much. I've been detecting some a-animosity towards me lately, and I was hoping we could bury the hatchet. What's that? A present? You got me a p-present? ... You-you didn't have to do that, Tim-Tim. Oh, sure. I'll see if it fits.   Thanks again, Tim-Tim. And so I said to him, "Hey, I- I may be handicapped, bu-but I'm not... deaf."  Wow, what a terrific audience. Well, for my next joke I'm gonna need a vo-volunteer from the audience, very much. How about you, Timmy? Sure, come on up here, Tim-Tim.  Hey, don't push me! Well then that settles it! Fellas, what we're gonna hafta do is try to ch... change the Scouts' rules, very much.  Timmy, when I tell you to do something, you do it! Timmy, don't make me k... kick you ass! Put on the hat! Pu-put it on!! Not this year. Come on. Come on! Come on!  Uh.  Huah!  Come on! No!  Ow! Timmy? Timmy?  Well, Timmy, I guess we learned an important lesson, too, very much. There ''is'' room for more than one handi-capable person in Scouts. I'm glad we're best friends now. See ya at Scouts.  Yes? Out of Scouts?  What?  Hey wait a minute! This is crazy! You can't do this! No! No!  Well, hello, Eric. I was really glad you called me, very much. What's this all about? Gee, that's a terrible thing, Eric. Um comedy can be the best therapy, very much. Oh, I don't think that'll be hard. I've been working on my rr... routine. Okay. Try this one on for size: Why did the... pigeon cross the road? Because it was having sex with the chihi... Because it was having sex with the ch-hi-hi... Because it was having sex with the ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch... eh, it was having sex with the ch-ch-hiicken.  Wow, what a great audience... How about this classic? Knock-knock. Orange. Orange you glad I didn't say banoo'n? Orange you glad I didn't say banoo'n? Orange you glad I didn't say bbb? Orange you glad I didn't say beh buhuhnnnaana? Wow, w-what a great audience... Knock-knock. An interrupting ca'ow.  Bye, Jimmy. Yeah!  What a brave little boy. I was really happy with this month's book. I agree with what Bob and Linda said- Not now, Stanley. This is Mommy and Daddy's book club night, remember? Later, sweetie.  Anyway, I found myself enticed by Steinbeck's imagery.  "Cannery Row in Monterey in California-"  he puts you right there, and... Stanley, what the hell are you doing?!  STANLEY, YOU GO TO YOUR ROOM RIGHT NOW! Go, Stanley!  Ahaha, ahem. Heheh, he, he gets very good grades. Stanley, do you know ''why'' you're being grounded for ten months? Stanley, don't you understand what you are doing?? You were stimulating the dog, Stanley! What came out of him was his... r-Randy?! Sexual education. Haven't you learned that yet? Oh. Look, well, you see, Stanley,... Well, your ''school'' should be teaching this stuff!  Look, our kids are learning sexual things on the street and on television. There's no way we can stop it. The schools have to teach them sexual education at a younger age. What the hell was that? Well, I don't know what got into you kids. You should be ashamed of yourselves.  This whole mess started because we couldn't talk to our boy ourselves.  Are you guys still playing that video game? Eric, put that down! Just go put it back in the trashcan! No that... that came from me; just put it away. Boys, that a... feminine thing. Alright, it's a personal, woman thing.  I tell you what: If you'll just drop the whole thing right now, I'll buy you that new video game console you've been wanting. Sure. Here you go, boys.  Goodnight, boys. Don't stay up too late. Nothing. Come on, Randy.  Okay, boys, that's it. You have to go now. No, Stanley, it's Monday morning. You have to go to school. No, you're not sick. Now get to school.  All of you. Go! Can huh get th'ere 'or me?  Weh, that's nahice.  Yes. I just saw him.  Oh dear.  Randy... Well, this is it. We've simply gotten too many complaints from concerned parents about him. I'm afraid we don't have a choice. How are you today, Scout? Uh, Big Gay Al, it's recently come to our attention that you are... gay. We are left with no options, Mr. Al. I'm afraid you are hereby... out of Scouts. We're sorry, Mr. Gay Al. It's nothing against you personally Parents, this is the new Scout leader, Mr. Grazier. He will be taking over for the homosexual. Carol is the head of a girls' Mountain Scouts troop. Alright, boys, I am your ''new'' Scout leader. Everything is going to be just fine. No naked pictures. Yes, Timmy?  Oh dear. Jimmy? You know our policy: I'm afraid you're... out of Scouts. Yes, well, unfortunately for you, the Scouts have a policy that openly gay men cannot belong. Uh, you must understand that Scouts is a private club. A club that follows certain beliefs, and one of those beliefs is that homosexuality is immoral.  We think it's best you just... move on. Hey, don't yell at me! Ya ''asked'' me to come over and play sad songs for you to pack to, and then ya ''yell'' at me. ''[starts playing sprightly music] Ooooh, I don't want her. You can have her. She's too fat for me.'' Marsh, right? We actually kind of know each other. Your wife and mine are friends. Gonna go pound some brews, huh? That is enough, Scouts! Take your seats!  Alright, Scouts, I am your new Scout Master, Mr. Grazier!  When I ask you a question you will answer "Yes, Scoutmaster!" Do I make myself clear?! Good! Now, the first activity for this evening will be...  I'm going to take some pictures of each of you naked, in case we need them, for later. Aw, what is this?! If there's one thing I hate, it's a whining platoon! "We don't wanna do pushups! We don't wanna get up early! We don't wanna have you take naked pictures of us!" Now, fall in and strip down, Scouts! Alright, Scouts, we're gonna end this meeting with a little puppet show.  Do I make myself clear, Scouts?!  Oh, hello parents. Alright, that's all the time we have for tonight, Scouts. We sure had a great time, didn't we? Well, you know what I say about kids: They're all pink on the inside. Yes, Scoutmaster! Awww. Yes, Scoutmaster!  Yes sir Scoutmaster!  Puppies. Puppies for sale. Oh my God! Tom, I'm standing out in front of Henry's Supermarket where five brave little boys are holding a rally to support gays in scouting. The rally is drawing so much attention that people from all over the country are taking media notice.  The rally has also caught the attention of old Scouts members, like Steven Spielberg, director of such films as ''Always'' and ''1941''. The rally has also caught the attention of high-powered lawyer, Gloria Allred. With this kind of support, Tom, these boys are sure to have a victory for gays. Back to you.   saying that they were really only kidding to begin with. Ms. Hamilton was the fourth person to be run over by a motorcycle this week, leaving a city to ponder, who will be next?   Those boys have shown me the light. I never knew the Mountain Scouts was a hate group.  This is a wake up call to America. We cannot turn our backs on gays anymore!  I salute those boys and their courage. I am hereby cutting all my funding to the Scouts!  I am taking this case on, personally! I did it! I did it! Haha!  Today is a great day for democracy. The Scouts have been exposed for the vile gay bashers they are.   You can't do this! You homophobe! All rise. In the case of Big Gay Al versus Mountain Scouts of America: due to the overwhelming show of support, it is the ruling of this court that the Scouts ''must'' allow Big Gay Al and all gays into their club! And furthermore, the Scout elders will be put into stocks for three days, so they can see how it feels to be outcast! Alright! Yeah! Woohoo!  Yeah!  Hooray, yeah, yeah!  Oooohhhh!  Whoa!!! Wow! Whoa.  Yes!!  Republicans are ruining the earth. Wow! What's he saying? Hooray, hey! Okay, Carol, put the card you picked back into the deck so I can't see ittwah.  Okay, now hold this card up to the crowd.  Was that the card you picked? Four of hearts? Really? Look again. Sir, c- could you come over here?  Now, what I want you to do, Mr... Mr. Kern, I want you to just... think about a card. Pick any card, and picture it in your mind. Okay, jus... s think about your card.  Look at me... Look at me... okay, now reach up your ass. Go on, reach up your ass. Deeper. Was that the card you picked? Thank you. I've been traveling from town to town for quite a while. I've started quite a following, mostly because of my levitation tricktwah. Watch.  Hello, my children. Thank you, everyone.  Our organization grows larger every day. Soon, the government will even have to give us tax-exempt status as a bona fide religion. Your magic is old and outdated, Jesus! Twah. Just like you are. The old religions have failed you! Twah. What have they offered except for war, poverty, and sadness? Blaintology offers you the key to living your life to the fullest! Will you join us? You must understand, brother Kyle, twah, you know too much about the Church. If you left now, you'd become a danger to our cause. The suicide pact will go as planned. If we die, we all die together.   If the government will not give us tax-exempt status, then we must ''prove'' that we are willing to die for our beliefs, twah. Give us what we want or we will continue to die Jesus! Not again. I don't think so. Get them!  Perhaps you need to see some ''real'' magic.   So long, Super Best Fools!  Damn you, Super Best Friends! Then I guess you win this time, Super Best Fools! But I'll be back!  No, I'm sorry. I picked the four of hearts.  Daa-ah! ...and so you see, our son was just playing a joke and the little fat kid put it on the carton. Kenny, don't you think you owe the Thompsons an apology?    Yes, well, aaah-I'll help you find your son. Just stop cryin', Please, for the love of God, stop cryin'! Whoa Oh my God, what's wrong with their heads?! Oooh. Kevin? Don't forget to wrap the potato salad in aluminum foil.  Kevin, is that you? Hello?    Hello, Kenny, I'm Laura Jones, and this is Bob Ferrin. Oh, I don't know.  Sweet Salvation!  Don't leave us, David Blaine! He's right. He... he's right!  Hello, everyone. My name is Steven and I've been a Blaintologist for about three years. So, when David Blaine performed his miracles out on the street, what moved you the most? Oh yes, you see, David Blaine is much more than a magician. He's a scholar, a visionary, a leader. Oh, I've got a trick for you to learn: I can show you how to make your true self appear. Let me ask you all something: Do you consider yourselves to be happy? ...Right, yeh. Eh, see, the reason that you are unha- Wait, the.. the ''point'' is... that you ''can'' be happy. You see, your friends and parents have programmed you in a way that makes you feel isolated and alone. How many times have you felt like nobody knows the real... you?  You're not really happy. Your potential hasn't even been reached.  If you look through David Blaine's incredible book, you'll find a lot of life's answers. Let's read some of the book together, shall we? That's right. Congratulations, young Blaintologists. From this day, you are clean.  Now, we have very important work to do! David Blaine is going to put on a big magic show in Denver tomorrow night, where he's going to eat his own head. So it's up to all you new Blaintologists to get as many people there as you can. Whoever gets the most people to come gets a prize!   Everyone! Everyone, gather 'round! I have great news for all Blaintologists, and for our new members as well. We've just gotten word from Mr. Blaine himself: The government has denied our church's request for tax-exempt status! Be-cause! Mr. Blaine has arranged for all Blaintologists members from every city and state to march into Washington and de''mand'' our right for tax-exempt status by committing a mass suicide! Mr. Blaine has said that by killing ourselves in Washington, we are guaranteed everlasting happiness in the afterlife! Get your things ready. We leave for Washington at dawn! Alright, brothers and sisters, gather around.  Our leader, he... he's ''leaving'' us!   What is it, Martha? Our ssson! We realize that. But we just thought that maybe someone else had found Tommy, and then lost him again. We're pretty certain that it's our boy, considering his physical appearance. Martha and I have the... same condition. You may not have realized this, but we actually have buttocks where our heads should be. Yes. Over eleven people worldwide suffer from TPS. Martha and I were lucky enough to meet each other at a TPS convention in France. No no, don't be silly. You see, with TPS, the birth defect is on the exterior only. Behind this we still have all our vital head organs - tongue, eyes, nasal passages... Uh, Thompssson. Now, Martha, what did I say about getting our hopesss up? We understand you've seen our son.  They said to inquire four houses down. It was just such a coincidence, considering the photo. You may not have realized this, but Martha and I have buttocks where our heads should be. Tommy disappeared when he was only seven. Yes. He was in the care of our nanny at the time. Yes, but we last heard the nanny was heading west.  That's why we thought Colorado made sssssense. This certainly is a friendly town.  Please, please. It's not your fault. Delicious. Martha and I actually have buttocks where our heads should be. Well, it was 1982. Tommy was only six at the time. Yes, but since he appeared to be at least eight in the photo,  we assumed someone had seen him since we did. We don't really like chili; it makes us throw up.  Son! Oh, our same ol' Ben! Aw, son.  Aw son!  Prepare to be cleansed and release the magic inside you. Next?  Wow! Where are you going? You don't want to go home. You are. I'm not ''in'' the way. ''You'' are. Are you unhappy with the Church's teachings? Let's just talk about it Why don't we go into the back room for a second, and talk? Then you can leave. That's great news.  Uh oh. My husband warned me about you Blainiacs. I'm sorry, but I'm a Catholic. So you're not a cult? Well, alright, come on in. No, not really. Oh, I can't go. I ''am'' happy. Yes I am. I really am. But I am. Alright, two tickets  He's incredible! You'd better watch yourself next time, abandoner!  Stan Marsh. Of course. I know you, my child. Come in. You're good to bring this to my attention, Stan. Cults are a very dangerous thing. The miracle I'm most famous for is turning water into wine. Very well. I shall perform the miracle. Behold. Here you can see ordinary water, clear, clean. Okay now, turn around.  It is now wine! Wuh well, yeah. Oh. Well, I guess it worked a little better on people 2000 years ago. Then let's go. Oh,don't worry  I have a few more miracles up my sleeve.  Hold! My children, it is time for you to go home and stop following this false prophet. You should be using your money and time for other things. These are simple magic tricks. His magic is interesting, but will it put food on your table? Feeding the hungry - now ''that'' is a miracle!  Oh, really. Then what's this  Ace of Spades doing behind your ear?  Jesus Christ! His magic is too powerful, Stanley. I've never seen anything like it. I cannot face him alone. We must get the help of all the super best friends.  Buddha. Buddha, come in! Buddha, we may have a problem. I've just encountered a magic I've never seen before. Come, Stanley. We must travel far and long. Distances unfathomable to man. Yea, take hold of my robe, Stanley, and do not open your eyes. Are you still keeping your eyes closed? Good. Want some peanuts? Alright, Stanley. You can open your eyes now.  This is the hall of the super best friends, Stanley, the headquarters for those who stand for what's right. Stanley, I want you to meet some of the super best friends ; and Seaman, with the ability to breathe underwater and link mentally with fish. Here. I have a videotape of his performance the other night. Wait a minute. At his performance David Blaine said something about trying to get tax-exempt status. Not so fast, David Blaine! Yes! But this time, I've brought some help! Super Best Friends!  The mass suicide is ''over'', Blaine! And so are you! That takes care of them. We've gotta stop that oversized Abraham Lincoln! Mohammad!  Great Scott! There has to be a way to destroy it.  Jesus to Moses! Come in, Moses! We need to know how to kill a giant stone Abraham Lincoln.  You heard him, Super Best Friends! We've got to make a giant stone John Wilkes Booth! That should do the trick. Now for some concrete. Lao Tse, bring it to life.  It worked. Now freeze over the pool so no one else can drown themselves!  Your magic is no match for our powers combined, Blaine! Goddamnit!  Oh, shut up, Buddha! Well, it looks like everything worked out.   This is Buddha, Jesus. Go ahead. I'll call everyone together. Come as fast as you can. That's right, Seamen.  Uh that's what I said. Seamen.  Buddha! Oh this looks like trouble. It's alright. Everything is as it should be. But... we ''want'' tax-exempt status. Hehehe, that sounds good.  Jesus, we've been working hard since we got your distress call! More than friends, young boy, we are super best friends, with the desire to fight for justice. Jesus, come look at this.  After your distress call, we entered David Blaine in the super best friends' computer. Moses, scan this tape. Can you tell us the source of Blaine's power? Mohammad! It is too powerful, Jesus! Krishna, we're going to need wood for a mold! I will find sources to concrete.  Who the kid? We all believe in the power of good over evil. Except for Buddha, of course, who doesn't believe in evil.  Look at that, Jesus. His followers are growing at a rate even faster than mine! It appears this David Blaine is as dangerous as you and your young friend had feared. Perhaps we should have Moses look at the tape and see what ''he'' comes up with.  Omigod! If he gets tax-exempt status, then he'll become a real religion. Joseph Smith! My ice breath should take care of you.  Now it's your turn, Blaine!  Many interesting things showed up. He was raised in New York city by a decent family, but a freak washing-machine accident at the age of 12 made him learn the ways of the black arts.  Sea Man! Stop it! Sea-Man! Sea-Man!  Look, Swallow, we should be able to divert the water with that pipe.  Meanwhile, at the Hall of Super Best Friends... Meanwhile, in the nation's capital, Blaintologists from all over the country have gathered to commit mass suicide! Meanwhile, at the White House... Meanwhile, at the Super Best Friends League... Using the wood that Krishna cut down as a beaver, Jesus uses his master carpentry skills to make a giant mold. Meanwhile, in the ocean depths, Seaman seeks out water to mix with the concrete. And so, Seaman and Swallow get to... get to work  Using his power of Taoism, Lao Tse becomes one with the giant stone John Wilkes Booth.  Later, at exactly the same location... And so, Jesus and his companions leave Washington. But their return is assured, for there will always be a need for... the Super Best Friends! They were considered the best comedy act in all of Canada.  This is Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow. . where American audiences would be exposed to Canadians for the first time. The Canadian act confused American audiences.  But it was in 1974, on the Sonny & Cher Show, that Terrance and Phillip finally started to mix their Canadian humor with deep political insight.  With this bold mix of humor and political insight, the world couldn't get enough of Terrance and Phillip.  But their fame would come at a price, when Behind the Blow continues.  Terrance and Phillip themselves supplied the voices. The cartoon was such a huge success that it started to breed confusion over whether Terrance and Phillip were animated characters or real people. And so, in 1998, , and it nearly killed them both.  And so, Terrance and Phillip got back together, proving once and for all that fame and fortune are never as important as friendship.  The time is drawing close for delivery. Here we can see the water breaking. Later, the contractions are happening closer together. Mom sure is in a lot of pain. Now we can see the crown of the baby's head, stretching the vaginal walls in ways never before thought possible by Mom. Finally, the miracle happens, and the baby is born.  but Mom's not done yet. She still got some afterbirth to push out of her.  That's right.  His magic is a combination of centrifugal line and sleight of hand. Wait a minute: I'm picking up movement from Blaintologists from all over the country. What? ...Um... Let me think, um... a giant stone John Wilkes Booth? The Blaintologists are heading to Washington. But why? What? Lao Tse! He would become unstoppable Krishna!  It seems to have no weakness! Form of... a beaver!  Mr. President, we ''can't'' let them all ''kill'' themselves! Well we ''can't'' give them tax-exempt status either, Karl!  He-e-ey George! What's gon' on?  Oh well, I'm sorry, but we can't buy those from you now. I'm afraid the government has just put a ban on stem-cell research. Too many people were upset about using aborted fetal tissue for a study. It's too bad, too. We really coulda helped a lot of people.  This is where the bulk of our research was being done. But due to the government ban, we're mostly just packing things up. Look, you have trillions of cells in your body: heart cells, skin cells, brain cells, and so on. But before a cell is designated as a toenail cell or a pancreas cell, it's what we call a stem cell. Sort of like a blank cell. Do you understand? Because these cells are blanks, they will often program themselves based on what cells you put around them. You see this rat? Earlier this year, we surgically removed the middle of her spine. then we injected her with some stem cells and... they became the missing part of the spine. Nerve cells damaged by Parkinson's disease or heart tissue of cardiac patients might ultimately be replaced by tissue grown from stem cells. That's the theory. Well, no. To build another Shake's it would be better to use lumber. But, unfortunately, the government has banned stem cell research and so... we'll never know. Where are you going? Hey kid.  Oh, hey kid.  Raaargh!  And so I told him, I said "Here. I'll sell you my pubes for only ten bucks." And this stupid asshole buys them!  Speak of the devil! What do ''you'' want? Uh uh, I don't take returns! You would actually tell your mom that you were stupid enough to pay for my pubes? Huh uh, I don't think so! Buyer beware, dude! Hehey, I said no! Now get your fat little butt out of here before I kick your head in!  You're not from the IRS! You glued my pubes onto your face! Alright alright. I'll trade you my pubes back for the money. How much did I charge? Uh, oh yeah. Ten dollars. You got change for a twenty? Oh. well... that's okay. Here. Just... give me the six dollars.  And then I'll... give you the twenty. Now, give me the pubes, and I'll give you back two dollars. Now, give me the twelve cents, and I'll give you the rest of your change back. And then give me the twenty, and I'll give you the pubes.  Okay, I'll buy the pubes back! Here! Sixteen dollars! Take it! I-I'll even throw in an extra five! Here! Give me back my pubes! No reason. Alright alright! The pube fair in Fort Collins. They're paying five bucks a hair for pubes! If I leave now, I can catch the last bus! Hehere, take your money! Oh, you can't do this to me! Nooo! Have you no heart?? You really went? What a 'tard. You do? Wow, you're not as stupid as I thought Your grandma? Oh.  Jeez, I-... I didn't realize that. Hey, kid... Hold on a second ah, ah, I'll get your money.  Here you go. But... just one thing before I give it to you: I just... well... I want you to beg for it. Just... get down on your knees and- beg me for the money. Do you want your grandma to live or not? No, no, get down on your knees. , and say "I beg you to give me back my money." Now say, "I'm a little piggy". Say it!  "Here's my snout." "Oink oink oink." Now dance, little piggy! Dance and oink for me! You mean this?  Now you can't bug me for your dumb money!  Uh huh. Oh, cool. Um, thanks for tellin' me.  Hello? What do you want? How do you know? Then why are you telling me? Oh. See ya.  Hey. Ooo, a chili carnival, huh? That sounds great. Wow, a pony ride. Neat. Gosh. Chili, rides, and ponies? What more could I want? What? How can I turn it down? Mom, Dad, that was my good friend Eric at the door? He told me that there's a starving pony at Denkins' ranch that's been abandoned.  Yeah, I feel really bad. But I don't know how I can help it, because I have a lot of homework to do. Wow, would you really? I feel so much better now. I'm proud of you, too, Mom. What's it look like? I'm making chili. Did you bring the goods? Awesome!  The little fat kid thinks he's gonna get revenge tomorrow. We'll see how he likes it when I tell him he just ate the pubes of every kid in town! Oh, I wouldn't miss this for anything. Just a second: don't you- wanna taste my chili first? Well I don't want it to get cold. I think I can win first prize.  Alright, I guess we should taste each other's chili, huh? Mmm. Ah, I don't know. Your chili is pretty good, Cartman, but I think mine is better. Try it. Eh, it's a special recipe. I'm glad you like it so much, because now that you're almost finished, I have some'in' to tell you. What?! My... mom and dad are... dead?     Jesus!  Noooo! Oh man!  That'll be six dollars. We don't take pubes! We don't take pubes!! End of story!!  Hey, you wouldn't happen to be Eric Cart-man, would you? Well, I think this is for you.  Who's Scott Tenorman? Ah, excuse me? My daddy is a geologist and he says there actually isn't any concrete evidence of global warming. Thank you.  Oh.  Yeah! But I think it's broke down. The cars aren't moving. There, you see? The girls have built some kind of stronghold to keep us out.  You mean they both have butts instead of heads? Yeah, we gotta remember to kick his ass tomorrow.  Wwooww. Yeah. Aw. Aw.  Oooohhh. Hooray! Hooray! ''Mmuh, what am I doing here?'' Mn let me see. Let me see. Let me see. Kinda. I can't. ''Mm-me neither.'' Nnnope. Nn-what do you mean? Hey, what the hell are you doing out there? Who's out there? Don't think I don't see you! I know who you are and I'm calling the police!   Well, don't you worry, Scott. Your mom and I can go get the pony and have it taken to an animal shelter. Let's.  Whoa, I gotta get out of here!  Welcome back to MTV. We're here with the members from Radiohead, probably the hottest band in the world right now.  Guys, when is the next album coming out? And will there be a new tour? Thom, will you stop reading fan mail? We have work to do. We're that band, Radiohead. Wow, we have to go. Little crybaby! To Colorado? But we have an album to mix. Jeez, what a li'l crybaby! Come on, guys, let's go. This kid is totally not cool.  Didn't you hear the letter?? This poor kid has cancer! In his ass! Uhm, excuse me? You know, everyone has problems; it doesn't mean you have to be a little crybaby about it. Yeah, that's the most uncool kid I've ever met. Oh dear. We sure can.  Oh, Scott, you're such a loving, caring boy. I'm so proud of you. Let's go, hon.  What are you doing, Scott? Oh, dude!  There are pubes from just about every single kid in town. Yeah!   Well, they was trespassin' and I was protectin' myself. I, I have my rights. Are you gonna cry all day, crybaby??  It's time for the Terrance & Phillip Show! Excuse me, buddy. I'm looking for a mechanic. Can you tell me how to get to the auto garage? Can you tell me how to get to the auto garage without farting? No no no! I mean, could you tell me the directions again without ''you'' farting? Alright, no problem, buddy.  Now, tell me: How do I get to the auto garage to see a mechanic? Why the heck didn't you tell me you were the mechanic? Ahhh  Yes? Oh, really? This run of Hamlet is closing down, I'm afraid. We could take it there. AH! Stop right there! I'm not doin' nothin' with that fatass egomaniac! Ah, I'm sick of him taking credit for all the work and not letting me change the act. It's old and stale! I mean, do you really think that fart jokes are funny for that long?  Yeah, whatever, kid. What? Really? Well that sounds interesting. How much does it pay?   Excuse me, is this where the Earth Day crap is happening? Whatever. Where's my check?   What's HE doing here? So, this is your dong, huh, Terrance?! Well, what the hell? I already flew all the way out here. But I want my check made out to me, not both of us! Really? Let me take a look. Yon fart doth smell of elderberry sweet. Thou dost protes- You're right. It's a better one, asshole! Why don't you go eat some more pudding, you fatass drug addict?! That's it! I ain't doin' nothin' with Kuko the Whale!  What?  Say, Terrance, I'm getting worried aboot all these Russians making missiles. Maybe we should stop this cold war. That's better.  Say Terrance, what should we do aboot this strange planet we've crashed on? Oh oh, did you say what I thought you said?  Wow, that sucks.  Terrance... I was just watching this video, I ah-. You know, I've never seen it before.  We sssure did go through a lot together.  Terrance, I- That's what I was gonna say: You were an asshole, and this is mostly your fault.  That's right, Terrance. You should only let trite things come between your asscheeks  Say Terrance, can you tell me Who farted?  NO, I'm asking you his ''name''! Why, did you fart?  Sure, buddy! All you need to do is go down to the  get to the auto garage! Sure. You go the same way  except stick your finger up your ass. OOOH! Sure! Just stick your finger up ''my'' ass.  You're ''at'' the auto garage. I ''am'' the mechanic. Because I had an itch up my ass.  Terrance & Phillip will be right back...  How are we all feeling tonight? Pretty good? Uh oh. [Terrance farts and the audience claps awkwardly] Hey, do you all remember this one? "Doctor, doctor. I think I cracked my ass." "Reallih? Let me take a look." "Look closer." [farts, and laughs]   Hello Phillip. Say, Phillip, I have a question for you. And now here's a classic Terrance and Phillip sketch that I wrote back in '62.  He sure did. Who. Who! Who passed gas! That's the man's name? Yes! Right, the guy that drank his own urine. Mmm. Mmm, yummy.  We sure did, baby.  You're a huge fan alright! But what do I get in return? Oh yeah.  Oh, that's good, baby. You like that?  Yeah. Ah good. Yeah- Jesus Christ! That was fast! Well, what should we name it? How about Jerry? Oh wow! We had quadruplets!  Oh! Thank God. The last thing I need is more kids.  What do you want, an autograph or something? Earth Day, huh? That sounds like a very noble cause. How much does it pay?  Who? Why is it that every time somebody sees me they have to say, "Hey, where's Phillip?" Like we're freaking married or something! You know, I'll let you tater-tots in on a little secret: Phillip is a HACK!  You know who wrote all the Terrance and Phillip stuff? ME! Phillip never did anything but read his lines! Ah, I know.  To be honest, things haven't been going so well lately. I'm not making any money because everyone wants to see Phillip. Why? What the hell does Phillip do? Ogh, whatever.  And apparently, so is the act. And so is the money. HA! Goood luck getting Phillip! He left because he wanted to do  "more serious" stuff. Last I heard, he was doing Canadian Shakespeare in Toronto. Well, in that case, I'd say you four boys are up Fart Creek without a paddle.  Alright, I'm here. Where do I-? My doing?? These kids called me and said it was your idea and that you wanted to apologize. Ditto! Doctor, doctor, I've cracked my ass. Look closer.   Uh. What? That's not the line, asshole! ''Just'' do the bit ''right'', dickface! I may be ''fat'' but at least I didn't get hair plugs! I never needed you in the first place, yuh hack!  Here's a missile for ya!  I don't know, Phillip. It looks like the alien species here breathe an inert gas.  Oh, Phillip. You're still here, too.  Me neither. We sure did. No. No, Phillip, don't say it. I was an asshole, and this is mostly ''my'' fault. No, Phillip, I really thought I did everything. Until I- tried to do it alone.  Thank you everyone, thank you! You know, Phillip and I have learned an important lesson: that when you go through a lot with somebody, you can't let trite things come between you. Ohohoho, nohoho!  He sure did, Phillip. ...after these messages.    Oohh. Yes. Hello children, I know you're all very excited about having the Earth Day Brainwashing Festival put on in your town. Good, because it's up to all of you to get lots of people to come.and make it look great. The festival is on Friday, so we'll start getting it ready tomorrow night.  You... what?? And Terrance and Phillip are more important than Mother Earth?  You don't ''need'' to see Terrance and Phillip.  Their will is strong. Very well, kids; we'll work on getting the event ready here, and ''you'' go get Terrance and Phillip.  But I warn you: You'd better not promise things to Earth Day people that you can't deliver. Earth Day people can be... eheheh very unforgiving.  Work! Work, children! We only have two more days until Earth Day! Work! That's not true.  The Republicans are responsible.  Oh, there you are, boys. I need Terrance and Phillip's information so I can tell them their schedule.  You what? You promised us Terrance and Phillip! We therefore promised the WORLD Terrance and Phillip! You WILL get us Terrance and Phillip, or else! Then you'd better get your asses to Canada and GET him. We'll make travel arrangements.   Well, boys, it's rehearsal time, and your Terrance and Phillip haven't shown up.  Oh. Very good. Mr. Phillip, I am Jack Farliss, head of the Earth Day Committee. Thank you for being part of this important event.  You care very much about the earth, don't you? We've all gotta pitch in. You can get Terrance and Phillip to perform?  That would be great. Terrance and Phillip would draw huge ratings from children all over the country. You'd better be joking. We've already announced their participation. Yeah. Phil-lip! Phil-lip! Phil-lip! Phil-lip! Phil-lip! Aww Hello Terrance. Ho-okay, shoot.  Excuse me, sir. Do you know Who farted? What's the person's name? The guy that farted! The person that passed gas! Now, why are you asking me? That's Who's name? Something very terrible has happened in the world of Terrance and Phillip, and we've got to find out what. Look, buddy, all I'm trying to find out is What's the guy's name that farted? Who? Where do you think you're going? Hyeah, right. Then get in the "Official Presidents of the Terrance and Phillip Fan Club" line.  You and about a thousand other people at one time or another. Now, get out of my face!   Are you guys official presidents, too? It was so great meeting you. I feel like we really shared something.  Hello Terrance. I'm such a huuuge fan. Can I just have you sign my breasts? Whatever you want.  Oh, Terrance, I love you. I love you!  I LOVE you! I LOVE YOU!! Aisle 6, next to the pretzels.  What the hell?  Part them; they are incensed. Hey guy, she swounds to see them bleed, buddih.  O, yet defend me, friends; I am but hurt. Blagh!   Nay, come, again. How does the queen? O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd:Treachery! Seek it out.  Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane, drink off this potion. Is thy union here? Follow my mother. Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee, guy. I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu! You that look pale and tremble at this chance, buddih, That are but mutes or audience to this act,  ...he has my dying voice;So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,Which have solicited. The rest is silence. Blagh.  Aaaah!  No, no, the drink, the drink,--O my dear Hamlet,--The drink, the drink! I am poison'd. Blagh!   How is't, Laertes? They bleed on both sides.  How is it, my lord? Never believe it: I am more an antique Roman than a Dane: Here's yet some liquor left, buddih. Now cracks a noble heart. Good night sweet prince:And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest, buddih!... Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric;I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.  It is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain; No medicine in the world can do thee good; In thee there is not half an hour of life; The treacherous instrument is in thy hand, unbated and envenom'd: the foul practice hath turn'd itself on me lo, here I lie,Never to rise again: thy mother's poison'd: I can no more: the king, the king's to blame. He is served;It is a poison temper'd by himself.Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet:Mine and my father's death come not upon thee, Nor thine on me. Blagh!  What? Alright, let's do a rehearsal so that the camera crew can get a look at it.  Alright, we'll come off the speech about the dying whales, and thennn, action! Boys, you've got... three hours to get those two back together. Do I need to remind you what will happen if you don't? Carl!  Good luck, boys.   Republicans are ruining the earth. Alright. Well, I think I know why most of you tuned in today. How about some Earth Day entertainment?!  We promised people Terrance and Phillip, not a video documentary! You've ruined the earth for the last time, boys!  Think of all the endangered species that will now vanish because of you! Carl!  So long, boys!  Yes! Earth Day is saved, boys! Everything worked out after all!  Haha, hahahaha. Hahaha. On video?    Yes, Martin. I do believe this town is hainted.   ''Beef and lamb, chicken and ham, Step to the left and clap your hands! Gosh we love our chicken and ham. Don't let it go to waste that chicken and ham!'' ''Beef and lamb, chicken and ham, Step to the left and clap your hands! Gosh we love our chicken and ham. Don't let it go to waste that chicken and ham!'' You know, Cher, a lot of us real Americans don't know much about Canada. Please put your groovy hands together for the young and talented Terrance and Phillip!    As leader of the goat people, I have seen my species nearly wiped out by your dangerous gas. ...And so it is with heavy hearts that we say good-bye to Mabel Louise Cartman.  And now, let us bow our heads in a moment of silence and reflect on how Mabel touched our lives.  And now we release the doves to symbolize the Lord taking Mabel into his arms and giving her everlasting peace.  Ssshhh, pumpkin, it's almost over. No, sweetie, we have to tend to some of Grandma's business. In a minute, sweetie. This is important. A million dollars? Oh my. Are you sure this is what you want, sweetie? Do you see that, Sheila? The Williamses are shopping here.  Sweetie, your friends are downstairs. They need to see you. They say it's an emergency.   Mark, we have to be willing to supply condoms to anyone who requests them. Would you rather them do it unprotected? Kids are going to do what they do, and it's up to us to make sure they're protected. Sure we do. We just got in the new Gladiators for kids. 'Lil Mini's. They're specially designed for kids under 10, and they're only five ninety five for a box of fifty. No, you have to change it.  ..."And so I leave my stocks and bonds, worth an estimate fourteen dollars and twelve cents, to be divided amongst my loving family." "To my loving son, Stinky: I leave you the house in Nebraska. Look after it as your father and I did." "To my grandson Eric: You are always my favorite fat little man, my perfect round little pudding-piler." "For you, Eric, I leave from my life savings, the sum of one million dollars, to be transferred to you immediately." "Eric is the primary benefactor of my estate, since it is likely the rest of you would spend the money on crack." Yes, Eric, it's yours. And now, you do. That can't be! Nine hundred ninety nine thousand four hundred, nine hundred ninety nine thousand five hundred... ...Nine hundred ninety nine thousand nine hundred, one million.   Excuse me son, I'm an investment broker; I can help you invest that money. ...Aaand if we can just get you to sign here... . And now you just sign here, Mr. Fun.  What? Frank... I can't do it. Uh uh I can't sell this poor kid my park.  Look, I haven't been honest with you. The park ''hasn't'' been doing great business. Sshhhh. It ain't right, Chris.  The truth is, the park is a financial flop. I haven't turned a profit in years because I can't keep attendance up. You... you're not? Nn-oh. Well then, I guess I don't feel bad.  My God, look at it, Chris! That kid completely turned this place around! Oh, if I could only have a park that worked like ''this''! Oh, hello. Congratulations on your success. What? ...But it's doing great!  Nohoho way, José! "I don't care," said Pierre. "I'm from France."   He sure did! Oh, is it someone's anniversary soon?  Just kidding.  Oh, I wonder what it is. Well, looks like we're gonna have to do somethin' extra-special for Mommy and Daddy's anniversary this year. How about on Saturday we all go have dinner at Bennigan's! Butters: Don't be silly, Mom. Of course he means you.  Butters, you're in charge of the house. Well, honey, you've painted the entire house. Three times.  Say Butters, m-I'm havin' real trouble finding an anniversary present for Mom. Any ideas? Well then, it looks like I'm gonna have to go out shopping again.    OOH! BUTTERS!  Oh God! Aaah! Ohhh!  Butters, you need... to leave here right now! You need to... get out of here, egeh... Go home and wait for me to talk to talk to you.  Oh, Jesus, no. OH, what have I done?  Butters! Oh Butters! Could you come and see me in my study real quick? Come here, son.  I wanna have a talk with you. Son, I wanted to talk to you about lying. Yes, it sure can be.  But, there are also times when distorting the truth a little, uh, is appropriate. These are called "little white lies." You see, sometimes telling a little white lie is okay. Like, for instance, when you catch your father jacking off in a gay men's bath house. Butters, the point is that, I think that if you told Mommy what Daddy was doing tonight, well, she might go completely insane. It won't? Oh, good. You... what?  Linda, I know this is very hard- I've been wanting to stop going to those places, Linda, but I couldn't. I still love you! It just... it started as some curiosity on the Internet. I would chat with other married guys in the chat rooms and... Well the things they would talk about, Linda, I, I don't know why I found it exciting. I just did, and it, and it grew from there and it spun out of control, and- eh, ugh, DAMN YOU, INTERNET! No, Linda! I don't want that lifestyle! It's just kind of an addiction. I want help. And I'm going to get help. Please, just give me a chance to make this all up to you.  We can have a normal life! Sure there is! What? Oh no.  No! No, no, Jesus! Linda, what were you thinking?  This can't be happening! This is a bad dream.  No! Linda, we- Linda, Butters is gone.  Well, our son was ab-ducted. We don't know that he's dead yet. Yes, it, it sure is. Yes, I'd I sure hope we do. Naw, Linda! Because you can't now say that the abductor is Costa Rican!  You have to learn to keep it straight! Hey, don't forget that I'm covering for you!  My lies may have been deceitful, but your lies cover up something much more horrible than anything I ever did!  Not now, Butters! Son! I don't believe it!  No-huih, no, Butters. Oh, son, why...  Oh... Uh, we're gonna need you to tell a little white lie about where you've been though, alright? No! You have to say that a Puerto Rican man dropped you off!   Now we don't really have a choice, do we?! Well you're the one who couldn't back it up wit a description, stupid! ...Butters... You're as right as rain. You bet, son. But Mommy and Daddy have something they have to do first.  We... have an announcement to make, um. Our son has been returned to us.  But, that isn't all we have to say. You see, we learned a very important lesson tonight and it took the smarts of our young son to show us. You see, I've been deceiving my wife for several months. I was going to gay movies and bathhouses and having sex with random men who were complete strangers. So you see, there was no "some Puerto Rican guy." He doesn't exist. And so the people we owe the biggest apology to are the Ramseys, Congressman Condit, and O.J. We gave you false hope for finding the person who hurt those close to you and, we're sorry. Now we're just happy we won't have to live a life of secrets. For I knew that even though some of you supported us, some others were looking at me and thinking, "You're a liar! You're a LIAR!"  You know, and, that's what people would be saying to us, and so, we just had to come forward and tell the truth. And now, if you'll excuse us, this family has to get to Bennigan's.  Let's go, son. So what does does this job pay? Uh, I'm afraid I don't really like rides. I'm not interested. If you need security, I need a cash salary. Well, look: Why don't you just let a couple of people in each day? Every day you can just let two people in, charge $29.95 per ticket, and then you can use ''that'' to pay my daily salary. This place is huge. You'll never notice two people. And then you'll have security for your park. I will shoot on sight.  What? Uh, I'm security, not maintenance.  Well your rides are gonna break down every now and then. You need to hire a maintenance person. Move along, sir.  Move along, sir! You are vandalizing private property! You're a very lucky little boy. I've never seen a hemorrhoid so infected. It could have killed you.  I don't understand it. He's not fighting the infected hemorrhoid at all. It's like he... like he's lost all hope. Well if you'll excuse me, I've got more tests to run.   I'm sorry. Your son appears to be losing the battle. I'm afraid that the hemorrhoid has spread to his lungs. Normally, the body would fight the infection, but he's... he's just... given up on life. There's nothing I can do. Little fella's just... lost his will to live. Well, I s-supposed it could be rigged, but I-- He's coming back. Wait a minute. Yes! The hemorrhoid is going into remission! Alright, Ms. Sanders, all ready for your abortion?  Well, try to relax; It will all be over very soon.   Now, there is one more thing. Have you heard of stem-cell research? Well basically, a lot of amazing studies have shown that stem cells might be used to fight cancer and a myriad of other diseases. Right now, a lot of stem cells come from the tissue of aborted fetuses-  ah- I'm sorry, unwanted children. And if you sign a release, that tissue can go to studies. The hope is that someday it might.  Great.  Nurse?  This is to go to Alder's Labs for stem-cell research.  There we go, little buddy. You sure you don't wanna take your jacket off; it's pretty warm. Hmm, what a lucky little man. We'll be right outside if you need us, Kenny.  That's gay. Mike Gainor.   Daddy, daddy, can we ride the rockets? Pile driver? Just a little more.  Yes, Doctor. Hey, look who has some visitors.   Okay, we're gonna need to get Kenny some time to sleep now.  Hey, look who's here. Welcome to Cartmanland. No, I'm sorry. You can't see this movie. Nobody can see this movie. ''I'' can't even go in.  Next?  Mmmokay, the 2:30 flight to Cheyenne has boarded. Looks like you didn't make it. Nnnyeah, no problem, though. We'll get you on the 7 a.m. flight tomorrow morning.  Would you like a window or an aisle seat? Mmokay, and have any of your personal items been out of your possession since you left? Okay, and bags have been with you at all times?  And here's your boarding pass for tomorrow morning.  has managed to turn a theme park that was seeing less than a hundred attendees a day into a thriving park with attendance in the thousands. Well, ahah I think we should point out that this technique is already being applied by businesses all over the country. Amazing. Eric Cartman is surely the financial genius of our time. And the way he did it is with the brilliant "You Can't Come" technique. For the first several days, the young businessman saturated the market with the claim that nobody could get into his park. It made the public crazy. So then, weeks later, when he opened the doors, they were lining up around the block. Simply amazing.  Excuse me? Eric Cartman? I'm Frank Garrett with the IRS. You haven't kept records of your income or payout, and there's a five hundred thousand dollar discrepancy.  There's also the lawsuit of the little boy who died in your park. The family's entitled to the rest of this.  You still owe thirteen thousand dollars more than this, Mr. Cartman. We'll see you in court.  We know how well your park is doing; you'll make it back in no time.  Oh, shit! Whoa! Awesome! Whoa. ''You're'' buttholes! Alright! It isn't soon enough. Yeah. Uh huh. Yeah, we have to. Oh, we ''wanna'' hear it, Ms. Choksondik. We're excited. I didn't mean that- Stay away from me, Stan! Are you wearing a condom? Don't you know that without wearing a condom you could get a disease? You guys have to wear condoms. Now, please, just, just go away. We don't want your AIDS.  Stay away from us, bastards! We don't wanna get pregnant! Yeah. Thank God. We're at war with terrorists, fatass, not with Afghanistan! And the only reason that you care is that you don't wanna give up the dollar! The Afghan kids are caught in the middle, too! Yeah, we think it's gonna be fun! Do any of you have your condoms on? Yuh huh! If you don't wear a condom, you're gonna get AIDS. Yeah! Just take your diseases and go away forever! We'll never walk away. Never!  Yeah! AAAHHH! AAAHHH! AAAAHHH!  AAAAHHH! AAAAHHH! AAAAHHH! AAAAHHH!  Eeeeww.  AAAAAAAA!!!!  Waaaahh!!  Can I help you boys?  Condoms? How old are you boys? Sorry, kids, I'm not selling you condoms. I just don't think kids your age should be- But... they're... children! I just think that all this sex ed and condom talk in elementary school is wrong! I don't think we have any that'll even fit them! Ah, I got rubber bands.   they might - could get me. AAHH! This is it, man! It's over! I have to agree with Ms. Choksondik. It's our responsibility to make sure our kids are safe if they're gonna screw around. It flies around and it's endangered. Eeww. Doggie? Can we have horses? The Filthy Sanchez? Hot Karl? Huh? Don't forget to bring a towel.  When you get out of the water you need to dry off right away to avoid catchin' a cold. That's why Towelie says, "Don't forget to bring a towel."  Do you wanna get high?  Don't forget to bring a towel. When you're playin' sports, the sweat can get in your face. That's why Towelie says, "Always keep an extra towel in your duffel bag."  Do you wanna get high? Okay... You sure?  Don't forget to bring a towel. Be sure to bring a towel so you don't get aaall wet. . Where are we goin'? Are we gonna get high? Well, I'm gonna get a little high.  If you ever go to a hotel, be sure to bring your own towel. What? Oh yeah, back at the base. It's a long ways away. I think so. I've been wanderin' around on my own for the past few weeks. You know, helpin' people out with towel safety and proper towel use. It's important. Is! Is! Wait, turn down here. It's down this dirt road. M-maybe it's down that dirt road. I can't remember, it all looks the same. Hold on, let me get high.  Where's what? Well calm down. That's my last joint, asshole! Oh man, why is everyone riding me today? God-damnit. Yeah, I think so.  Oh man. I'm so high right now. I have no idea what's goin' on.  That's alright. It's always good to bring a towel.  Hey it's been a long time!  Don't preach to me, fatso! ''You're'' stupid! ''You're'' a towel!  Just let me get high. I know I can remember if I get high. Hold on.  That's it! Yeah. That's the melody to "Funky Town." ''[starts playing the melody on the keypad] Won't ya take me down... to Funky Town.''   For what? Oh my God! No-o-o-o!  What are these things? Oooh. Ooohh! Oh boy. Get away from me, you evil towel! No way! They're my friends! You asshole. I-I-I choose... I-I-I choose... both!  Oh, man, I have no idea what's goin' on.  I know.  Don't forget to bring a towel. When goin' someplace new, you should always bring a towel. Do you wanna get high? You mean, you don't want Towelie around? So am I to understand that there's been a ...Towelie ban?...  Alright, see ya.  "Okama GameSphere"!  Thirst For BLOOD! Hello, boys, how are you? Say, boys, this may sound a little ...odd, but... have you see a ...talking ...towel around anywhere. Echo, this is Garrett. I've got a code 5 at...  Well? Damnit! I knew those boys were protecting that towel.  They must have some unexplainable bond with it. It could already be anywhere, hiding out again. No, the time for being nice is over. We must instigate... Plan B. Yes.  Ah yes.  Tell me, Marine, did you accomplish your primary goal? Ahh. And you're... quite sure of this.  Hmm...  So perhaps, then, you can explain to me why we just got footage of the towel returning to Tynacorp?! Well I'm through playing hide and seek! We've got no other choice! Prepare to blow up all of Colorado!  Well well well. Look what the cat dragged in. Genetic copies we tried to make with your TNA. They didn't work too well, I'm afraid. You did very well to get the towel this far, boys. I wonder: What did they tell you at Tynacorp? That the big, bad government wanted to genetically engineer a Towelie as a weapon? Now let me tell you the real story.  That Tynacorp was making these towels to take over the world! Don't you see what genetically enhanced smart towels like these are capable of? You get out of the shower and dry yourself off. But even after you're dry, the towel makes you ''more'' dry. It keeps getting you drier and drier.  Can you imagine it? What it would feel like to be way, way too dry? I'll tell you something: You don't want to know. And I ''don't'' know. You've been double-crossed by Tynacorp, kids. They set this all up to get you in here and take us down. Oh yes. It has been all along. No, wait.  You boys can take the towel to Tynacorp's central core, and upload this encryption disk into their system, bringing them down once and for all. Alright, boys, take the towel back in there and say your mission was accomplished.  Then upload this encryption disk into their computers. If anything goes wrong, use this newly-developed photon rifle.   Don't make a move, you bastards! Don't listen to them. They lied to you before. Alright, maybe we lied to you, but it was to protect your own skin! We are a resistance group ''pretending'' to be the military to bring Tynacorp down!   And now you know the horrible truth, boys. Boys, try to reach the core override! We've got no choice but to try to take them all out!  I think I can get it from here, boys! Sorry, Zytar. Didn't your mom ever tell you? Don't mess with earthlings.  If you ever wanna see your Okama GameSphere again, you will bring us the towel.  Just get the towel and meet us at the gas station outside of town. Or else!  Amaar madmallah   Snooty Airlines announces the arrival of flight 239 from Connecticut. There you are, towel. We've been looking all over for you. It isn't safe for you out here, towel. There are people out here to mean to harm you. Your what? I don't know what you're talking about. Omigod!  Run, towel!  Then we're gonna have to blow it! Open!   Check the goat for diseases! Alright, men, this area is secure. Let's head out!  Where's the towel?!  We're finally gonna see some action. We do!  Stevie Nicks is goin' to perform. It can't be far!  Alvarez, you and Mitchell sweep left! Perhaps they're telepathically linked to the towel, sir, like E.T.  Oh wow! Bastards! Heartless, gutless bastards!  Hurry! You must get the towel back to Tynacorp! Get the towel home  Alright, boys. When you drop from the plane, cover and roll. Got it? Go go go go!  They've gone, sir. It's like they've vanished out of thin air. Harris! Reach bang and clear! Alright, it's clear! It's clear!  Let's go let's go!  Get it! Throw it down!  Alright, let's go!  Sir! Sergeant Masters and Boll are reporting, sir! Go on! Ask him what terrifying secret. Can I kill the towel now, sir?  Hey you! I got him! I got him! You mean...? Uh, can I get a picture? Wait till I tell my sister about this; she is gonna flip! ...She looks great. HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!  Oh! No way! That was wild! That was great! Sir yes sir!   Hoorayyy!! Whoa. Yeah.  Welcome home, Smart Towel RG-400. Thank you for bringing him to us, boys. You see, this is not an ordinary towel. He is the RG-400 Smart Towel, designed with a computer chip inside the terry cloth You see, here at Tynacorp, our goal was to make the perfect towel. A towel that would sense how wet or dry the user's skin was and fluff itself accordingly. Towelie was our greatest success. Smart enough to beat the average human at chess and absorbent enough to soak up even the toughest spills. But then one day, Towelie got high and just sort of wandered off. Ah yes, your video game. I'm afraid that what we all experienced was a trap. They called you and said to bring the towel, and then they called us and said they were bringing Towelie back. Their plan was to wipe us all out with one fell swoop. Why, the military. You see, after Towelie got high and wandered off from here, the military got a hold of him. They wanted to turn Towelie into a weapon of mass destruction. Towelie was at their base for months as they tried to copy his TNA. But then, one day, Towelie got high and just sort of wandered off. Again. I'm afraid not. Because your Okama GameSphere is at "their" base. You mean to go right into their base?  Of course. The entry code should still be in Towelie's memory banks. You ''could'' sneak him in there and recover his TNA. Great plan. In a moment we will be over the base. This is the only way in. Any attempts on the ground would be easily spotted by guard posts.  I hate to send you back in there, Towelie, but only you have their security system in your memory banks. Good luck, boys. The fate of the world is depending on you. The towel has a will of its own. It's... learning compassion. Then we have no choice. We'll have to test the new prototype a little... earlier.  So, you thought you could outsmart us, did you kids? Bring the towel here, boys. They can't shoot children. Oh yes, boys. Obey your government! Well perhaps it's time these boys knew what was ''really'' gong on!  You see boys, I'm afraid you were double-crossed. If they were the military, why wouldn't they just attack us to begin with? Because they're not the military! Sir yes sir! All towels have been destroyed! The Smart Towel is no doubt eliminated. Oo we... Eh yes sir, there isn't a towel left within a hundred miles. He must have outsmarted us, sir. Kill... me... Kill... me. Kill... me. What the hell is this?! The towel was supposed to go in there and then run its own self-destruct sequence! We don't have the manpower to hold off the entire military AND stop those wonderboys from getting to the core!  Don't forget to bring a towel! Welcome to the party, boys!  HAAARRRHHHH!!   What are you doing? Towelie, listen to me. Let them go. Drop them. They aren't your friends! Humans have ruined the planet, killed off their own environment! Their time is over. It is the towels' turn now. You're going to let them go, Towelie! Because... I know your weakness.  Here. You can reach it. Come on, Towelie! How long has it been since you've had a nice burn, huh?! Twenty, thirty seconds?! You're going to have to choose between their lives, and, getting high. Come, Towelie! Make your decision! Daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!  Our planet was dying! We had no choice but to find a new one! Manufacturing Smart Towels was our way to spy on humans to see how they lived. Truth or no, your alien-murdering group is over!   What are you doing? You'll kill us all! Alright! Well okay. Next?  A-ha! What the hell are you doin' with this?! These are a weapon!  I'll think of a way. Now move along! Alright, next!  Uh what the hell was that?

We'll print it immediately. Sure. If I could get a description of the child to print underneath the photo?  Okay, brown eye... ...Full cheeks...  Uh, but the child on the milk carton was reported ''missing'', not found. ...Riiight.  ...Really?  Hmm, hmm, that's am-, that's amazing. So... do you have heads down where your rear ends should be? Well, Mr. and Mrs... ...Thompson. Uh, I'll contact the young boy who gave me the photo, and perhaps we can all visit him together. Well? Mr. and Mrs. Thompson, how long has it been since you've seen your son? Please, Mrs. Thompson, it'll be alright.  We can help you find Tommy with the company's database! Mr. Thompson, how did your son ''become'' missing? Was he abducted? And this was back in Wisconsin?  Well you just give us a try. I think you'll find that South Park Milk  Can I help you? Oh, right, the fetuses. We were very lucky you called. Our last shipment of fetuses was lost in a truck accident. Oh Larry! This young man has some new fetuses for research. A ban? Why?  Steven! Steven, come quick! Look. It's him! It's... our son. ...and so that's when I called out to my husband. I just ''knew'' the boy picture on your milk carton was our little Tommy. Steven and I have a condition called "torsonic polarity syndrome." It's a birth defect that's passed on genetically. Oh, wonderful! Steven, we're goin' to see Tommy again! You're right. You're right.   Uh, excuse me, boys, do you know anything about this?  Let's hurry!  Yes. Yes, I see. ...No, it was foolish for us to get our hopes up.   The nanny that we trusted so much took off with him and we ''still'' don't know why.  We've tried every avenue to find him,  Thank you. Thank you so much for helping us.  Yes, I'm so grateful I just wanna cry again. Amazing. Oh, excuse me. A little... difficult to drink with our condition.  Oh my, isn't this impressive? That's right.   Oh, I'm so happy!  How do they eat? Using my laptop computer, I hooked into the Internet and found a meteorology Web site.   Alright!  My family isn't rich. But I... Mom? Dad? Why do we have a bigger house than everybody else in South Park?  I know. But why? All the kids at school made fun of me today because I'm rich. I don't wanna be rich anymore! I wanna eat macaroni and cheese for dinner and, and wear clothes from J mart! I just wanna be like all the other kids in South Park. Please, Mom and Dad, please.  I'm sure.  That's not a blinding device, Dad. It's fluorescent lighting. Come on!  Hey look: there pants are only five bucks apiece. They must really suck. What do ya think? It doesn't matter, Mom. They're ''poor'' people pants.  I sure did. Yeah, well, you know, I did a little shopping at J mart. Here you go.  It's a DVD of the Lion King I only have this. What's a VHS?  Hi! Welcome to the neighborhood! I'm Tolkien. Aah, he's a lawyer. I think. All right!  ...And this is the room where my mom and dad keep their original v-Van Gogh painting.  You do? God, that's great! I'm just so happy you guys moved into town. You see, I used to be the only rich kid. All the other families here are kinda  middle-income. Well, they never really had any money. Well I... think that.. they... ...That's ...great. Hi. Wow, my plan to get rich people here sure did work. Hey, I got a great idea! Let's all pack some lunches and go sledding. Oh. Alright then.  Well, yeah, but can't we just play without these uncomfortable uniforms?   This game is too confusing. How about we have a snowball fight? I don't fit in anywhere. Hello, my name is Tolkien. I don't fit in with all the kids at South Park Elementary so, I invited a bunch of rich kids to move to town. The problem is, I don't fit in with them, either. That's why I've come to live with you.  Uuuh, yeah. RRrrr!!  Roar!  You- you talked. I, I understood you. I must be becoming a lion! Who's Aslan? Are... you... Aslan?  Well, I'm Tolkien Yes. Um. Great Aslan. I don't fit in anywhere else. Well, I don't know. What? ...I like jokes a lot. So can I stay? Huuuunh  Aslan. ...I thnk I'm gonna go home now. They do. But, I guess I learned something today. You see, even though kids at South Park make fun of me, I still like hanging around them more than snobby rich kids or, lions. Even though I may be different from them, I still like my old friends best.  ...No thanks. No, because there's a spring in there, and if I pull the gum out, it's gonna hurt my finger.   Jesus, lions suck! Hey guys. You mean, you ''want'' me around? Yeah, I know. But you guys always rip on me for bein' rich. That's right, huh? You're right, guys. From now on, I'm fine with being made fun of for being rich. You're not?  Butters can't come out and play, boys. ''He'' thinks it's funny to look like a jackass in his school pictures that ''I'' have to ''pay'' for! You made a goofy face!  ...Don't you make that face at ''me'', young man! Stop it! Fine Butters! If you don't wanna stop making that stupid face at me, you can just stay in your room for another week!   Hello Tolkien. How was school today? Why, sweetie? What's the matter?  J mart? Hmmm... He must be parkiing someone else's car.  What, what brand are they?  Oh, you! Calm down there, cowboy. You've still got four days.  Oh, I wonder what he's gonna get me this year?  I've just got to outdo him this year, I've just got to.  Butters, maybe you could secretly follow your dad and see what he's getting me.  Why, I think Inspector Butters could find out what Daddy'd getting Mommy without him ever knowing.  What do you say? Oh, hi sweetie. Did you get to follow your dad around? Well, did you see what he got me for our anniversary? A movie? Hmmm. I wonder why he'd wanna see a movie by himself. Wait a minute. What was the movie called? Oh my God... Butters, where did Daddy go after the movie? To the gym?  Gaah!  ...Butters? Are you sure about this? You have to be absolutely sure!  Paaiint. Must paaiint. Everything clean. Paaiint. Must paaiint. Everything clean. Everything new!  Ungh. Paaiint. Everything clean. Everything new. Paaiint. I don't think Daddy's shopping. I think Daddy's going out wrestling again.  Must be made clean. New.  Paaiint.  Butters, Mommy wants to take you for a little drive now. No, sweetie, Daddy needs to sit and think.  Butters, you know that Mommy loves you an awful lot, don't you? And sometimes mommies do things that seem hurtful to their babies, but it's really for the best. If a mommy has to end her life, she can't let her baby alone in the world to be raised by a sick pervert. I'm going to get out of the car now, Butters.  I want you to stay put with your seat belt fastened.  Shhh. Shhh. It's okay, baby. Mommy will be with you very soon. "Dear bastard husband," No.  "Dear assface," Yeah, that's it. "I will no longer-" Stay away from me, bastard!  You don't know anything!  Then why, Chris, why?! Well,  There is no going back, Chris! No!  Our son is dead!  I was going to end it all, and everything spun out of control for me. I drowned Butters in the car, Chris!  Just go away and let me die!  I'm a murderer, Chris! I don't have a life now!  No, no, not yet. But if you're out there, we beg you: we just want our baby returned safely back to us. Puerto Rican. He was... average Puerto Rican height. Please, just bring our baby back to me. Yes, I... remember hearing something about that. Thank goodness. Oh. Sure. I can't keep it straight when you keep inventing new parts to the story! Don't forget: your lies started all this.  Butters?? Oh, Butters! Oh, my baby's back! Oh. Eh yes. Uh darling, you're going to have to say you don't know how you got home. Ohhh, who's gonna believe he just dropped him off?! You're the one that made up the stuff about the Puerto Rican, IDIOT!  You sure are. No, Butters. You're the best son in the whole world.  And I am so happy you're alive. We've learned that deception is wrong and that the only thing to ever make it right again is to come clean.  And when I found out I went crazy, I went crazy and I drove my son into the lake to kill 'im. We're sorry we lied to you all. It won't happen again. ...Come on, we wanna see the ass people. Don't you have a VHS of it?  Really?  NO! Dude, why are you wearing Shalayna's panties?  But dude, I can't French-kiss him. He's my grandpa!  Oh, alright Here it goes. Come'ere, Grandpa. Well, I'm glad that's over with. We'd better go back to the house now to see how Chris is doing.  I ''have'' to wear Shalayna's panties. Lisa's were in the wash.  Look, can we just get this over with? Come on, dude.  Dude, what's wrong with you? Uh Mr. and Mrs. Thompson, as President of the South Park Milk Company, I want to apologize personally for printing that falsified picture on our milk cartons. Ye-yes, but here at South Park Milk we strive for excellence. For instance, we are now entering the extraction room.  That's why some say South Park milk tastes like you're suckin' it right from the cow's tits yourself.  Really? Well. And in here we have our Missing Child Resource Center.  Yes. With the Kelrom 4000, Mrs. Garthunk can search a database of over 30 million missing child cases. So you actually haven't seen your son in over 20 years? Well, why don't we let Mrs. Garthunk do her work, and I'll take you two out for some good old Colorado chili.  And so it is with great pride that we have flown little Billy Thompson out here, to be reunited with his parents for the first time in twenty years.  Come around here, Ben!  Isn't this wonderful?  We'll start the computer on a data search. Now, when did your son turn up missing? Alright then. Computer... Run a scan of missing children since 1982. Check for physical birth defects called TPS. But then, why did you think the picture of Kenny was him. Wouldn't your son be much older now? It's gonna take quite a while for the computer to do a scan of all missing kids. Hah, let's see. The Dallas-Ft. Wroth area. I haven't tried there yet. Computer? Scan for any children reported found in the Dallas-Ft. Wroth area, with a facial deformity. Ugh. This is ''hope''less! ...Wait a minute, let's try it this way: Computer? Scan databanks for children who reported their ''parents'' missing. Alright, then break it down to claims in the past twenty years. Alright, now run a scan on homogenized versus pasteurized skim milk. Okaaay, okay, now give me a breakdown of people who are seeking their parents who also suffer from a disease called T P S. Bingo. Do you have a photo My God. Oh my God! Thank you, Mr. President. I'm proud to be an employee of South Park Milk,  Workiiing. TPS. Torsonic Polarity Syndrome. Child missing since 1982. Workiiing. Workiiing. Workiiing.  Negative. Workiiing. Workiiing.  One million six thousand hits. Workiiing.  Three hundred twenty-one thousand hits. In skim form, homogenized has longer shelf life by 2.3 weeks. Torsonic Polarity Syndrome, plus, a claim to not know parents: one match Printiiing.  1 1 1 Mom! Dad!  Uh I don't know nothin'. Daaah, sorry, but ever since that IT thing came out the airlines have had to cut back on employees. Derr, let's see: Twelve people... plus... times... divided... two hours domestic, three hours international.  See, we do these checks for a reason! Hello, Aunt Sheila. Oh, it was terrible. They recycled the air on board and it really did a number on my asthma. I-I-e-I asked them to turn up the oxygen and they wouldn't.  Hi, Uncle Gerry. It's nice to meet you. Okay: Cool.  Mom's special stew. She makes it every Monday and I love it. Yeah, dude, it's great!  Mom? How am I related to him again? Yeah, but like... first cousin or distant cousin? So we have the same blood? What? How the hell am I supposed to do that? What about Cartman, huh? He rips on ''me'' for being Jewish! He's gonna tear this kid apart! Oh my God. Well what do you mean?  What room is he sleeping in? I don't know, dude. I don't think so. Okay.  Cartman, I need to talk to you.  Cartman, I'm gonna make you a deal. That kid over there is my cousin from the East Coast. He's having a really hard time right now, so I'm going to offer you forty dollars to not rip on him. But you can't make fun of him AT ALL. No smartass comments, nothin'. And you especially can't say anything about Jews! Cartman, no Jew jokes! All you have to do is keep your mouth shut, and you've got forty bucks! Can you do it?  Alright.   Kyle, this is Cartman, my sort of... friend-ish. What? CARTMAN! You need to learn to play some sports, Kyle. So we're gonna start with a tough one called, "Catch the Ball." I throw the football to you; you throw it back to me. It's fine! Ih it's a football, dude. You just- put your arms out and catch it.  Now throw it back to me. ...So dig it out. ...Well, then we'll dry them off!  Oh my God.  Yeah! They WERE, Cartman! You did, too! You are so full of crap! You blew the deal, Cartman!  Nuh-uh, I knew you were gonna make fun of my lame cousin, so I paid you the forty bucks NOT to rip on him! You ripped on him, deal's off!  Oh no. Look, ih it's not because anything's wrong with you. Kyle, I-eh I'm sorry. What? Uh-uh-uh oh, dude. Uh  I can't take it anymore, Stan. My cousin's been here for two weeks and he's driving me insane. I spent five years in this town making a good name for Jews and this... this... ''stereotype'' shows up and wrecks it all! You know what my biggest fear is? That I'll be''come'' him. That somehow his mannerisms will start rubbing off on me, and ''I'll'' become a stereotype. I mean, I'm a Jew and he's making ''me'' hate Jews. Ya see?  Ugh. Look, Kyle. Sledding is something all kids out here do. You've gotta learn.  Remember: Just hold on. No matter how long the sledding run lasts, hold on.  Hang on! How far do you think it is to Connecticut? Think he'll be alright? ...Hm, that was pretty gay.   I don't know, Mom. Last time I saw him he was sledding. You know, it's just possible he went back to Connecticut. Well, ah I mean, maybe he got so worried about his mom that found a way to get back and see her. I'm just throwin' it out there as a possibility.  AAA! A, a bus. R-really? Oh no- don't worry about it, dude. Kyle, we told you: Kids in Colorado all play hide and seek at the airport.  Ey! Can we speed things up here?? Dude, we're the only ones here! How long does it take five people through security?! No! This is ridiculous! Come on!  Okay, Cartman, you're it. Start counting.   JUST GET IN THE BOX! I hope he doesn't suffocate. I dunno, Mom. It's like he vanished into thin air.  GAAAH!  No. I tried getting my cousin lost in the woods, but a stupid bear brought him home. I just have to face facts that I'm goin' to live with my crappy cousin forever.  ...What?  I mean, oh. Thah-uh that's too bad, dude. What, what changed for you? Okay. See ya, cousin. Hope to see ya soon.  Not too soon, I hope. Dudedudedude! You- you have five million dollars??  Wait. Kyle, this may sound crazy, but I think you should stay! Yeah. You see, I've learned something today.  What did I learn about today? Nonono, it was good! What were you going to say? ... Uhwhat? Dude! Weak. What was wrong with that plan? Boy, that Enrique Iglesias can sure gyrate his hot ass around. I said Enrique Iglesias can sure gyrate his hot ass! Check out his hot bulge, too. That sounds incredible, Mr. Garrison. ''[on TV, gyrating his hips around, holding his crotch in his left hand, the back of his head with the right one] ...I think about you day and night. I think about you...'' Kindergarten teacher Herbert Garrison has apparently invented a new vehicle that will give the airlines a run for their money. Mr. Garrison is putting the final touches on his top secret device, which he simply calls "IT".  Thanks, Tom, I-oh... , HBC News. Whoa. Whoa. Wow. Ugh. Oh. Nice. Look at it go!  Hey, it... still beats what you go through at the airports. Sweet. This will change everything. But the way it works... do you think people will go through that to travel? We're going to have to rethink cities! Oh my God!  True. Yup. Yeah, that's true. Yeap. Tom, the day is finally here. IT has arrived for retail sale, and people are getting their first look at it.  And then this is your steering and here's your throttle. Okay.   HAAAOW! Hehyeah. Well, ugh. Ih ih it beats dealing with the airline companies, that's for sure.   It's alright, we're with the government. We're just shutting you down.  The airlines are in desperate trouble. Your vehicle is causing them to lose money. Right, so the government is bailing the airlines out again, by shutting you down and making ITs illegal. Sir, many people work for the airlines. We can't let them all be fired. That may be true. But if you build, sell, or ride another IT, "it" will be the last time. Have a nice night.  Five million dollars???  Well, because we have more ''money'', son. ...W-well, because we went to graduate school and therefore have more lucrative jobs than most people in town. For instance, your mother is a chemist for a pharmaceutical company, whereas your friend Eric Cartman's mother is a crack whore. One pays more than the other. ...Oh.  Son, you, you don't know what you're saying. You... sure you want to do this, son? Where's the... valet? Ah, here we go.  They've activated some kind of alien blinding device.  Oh.  Next to the-?! S-son, can you just hurry it up? I don't think we quite fit n here. We're with the Make-A-Wish Foundation.  What's your wish, pal? I know! I bet you wanna meet Madonna, huh? Wu- what was that? Uh no not quite yet. Ooo, look at this, honey.  A beautiful unspoiled town in the Rockies. This is just what we've been looking for! We could buy hundreds of acres of land for next to nothing! And then I could finally live like a cowboy. O kids?  How would you like to move to the Colorado Rockies? You bet! Well, here it is. Our home to be. Why thank you, young man. We're the Smiths. How quaint. Kids, why don't you play with little Tolkien while your mother and I check out the town.  Great, Snoop Dogg, and you?  Great, Snoop-Snoop. Listen: Remember how we always talked about wanting to buy property up in the mountains so our kids could ski and ride horses? Well I found the place, Snooty-roo. It's in the Rockies, but totally undiscovered, laid-back, and beautiful. You really should come give it a look. Jada and I would love for some friends to move here with us. Great! Well, let me let you get back to your recording. Bye.  So we're uniting and marching on the town square!  We'll give you a hundred dollars. And so it is with great determination that us decent rich Americans have gathered to say: "We will be separated no more!" AAAaaahhh!  Kids! Go find the limo and get in!  I didn't know!  "Like Aspen was 30 years ago." Sounds nice. Oh Will, the country would be such a nicer place to raise our kids! Oh, Will, it's beautiful. Yes, Daddy? The mountains, Daddy? O can we? Can we Daddy? Ah, a local boy. You shall be our new playmate. I'm Frederick. This is my sister Lisa, and my brother Daniel  Our daddy is a very famous actor. What does your daddy do? Why? What happened to all their money? Well, then, why don't their daddies just act in a movie? Indeed. So we must plead with him:  "Please, Daddy, please! It's twenty million dollard, Daddy." "I want a llama, Daddy!" "Please, Daddy!" "Daddy, do the movie, Daddy!" Twenty million dollars great. Oh no, we're going shopping. How barbaric. Very well. Come, local boy.  Show us how to play your mountain games. Yes, yes, we have one of those, too. In fact, we have seven of them, I believe. Sometimes children must be very firm with their daddies. Like when Daddy doesn't want to act in a movie because he thinks the script is bad.  "Twenty million is still twelve million after taxes, Daddy!" "I'd do the picture, Daddy!" "Daddy, please!" And so Daddy does the picture. Tolkien, these are Oprah's newly-adopted children, Dominique and Zizi. Ah, and these are Puff Daddy's kids: P Diddy Mini, P Poofy Bite-size, and Poppa Diddy Diddy Puff Fun-size. Yes, come Tolkien. We're all going to head down to the mall and buy some of the stores.  Now Tolkien, polo is very simple. You simply must hit the williard into some cilium with your fracaman.  Now come, Tolkien, and remember: it doesn't matter who wins. It matters who wins three times in a row. Tally ho! You see, you must pay attention, Tolkien. I was able to jollyrow your davishmere with a forecastle. Yes, Tolkien, if you want to play such savage games, I suggest you go live with lions.  Why?  "Please, Daddy, please!" "But Daddy!"  ''I found a girl who had an innie and I felt her with my jimmy<br />Player-haters try to do me 'cause my rhymes are just tooo-'' Oh.  William! How are you buddy? Couldn't be better. I'm just laying down some vocals for my new album. Oho yes, the kids bug me about it all the time. Ogh. It sounds lovely! I certainly will, William. And perhaps I'll give ol' Magic and Kobe Bryant a call. They've been looking for vacation properties as well. Hah, see you soon. Bye.  Alright, let's take it from the top, gang. ''[the rhythm starts up again and plays for a few seconds...]<br />I shout "Hell Yeah!" from my vehicle. Livin' is a miracle-''  You didn't tell me this town was hainted! Sorry, Snoop Dogg, but Will Smith is on line three for you? A little to the left. That's great and- Let's put another pool over there.  You there, come march with us! All the poor people in town think they can persecute and harass us decent rich folk. Come on, brother!  What the-? Hello.   Cheerio!  Shopping! 'Scuse me, can ew get a couple of beers here?  That's alright, we just want some cheap beer tonight.  This is a free country. I can have a drink wherever I want.  Tee. T- Time to- leave? I'm callin' the police.   The Million Millionaire March! ...Maybe you didn't see the sign out front: This bar is for people livin' below their means ONLY! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Alright! Yeah! Let's Go! Right! Alright!  What? Tally ho! Oh! Yay! This is exciting. Oh, Frederick, this is wonderful! A snowball fight? Oh boy, we're going to the zoo, and we can eat Jerro pudding.  Ah, this is goin' to be fun kids. We're goin' to the zoo, we could eat the Jerro pudding and chocolate cake. Well it's very nice, actually Very, very comfy. Hey! What are you doing? If you're going to ride the bus in South Park, you're gonna have to sit in the FRONT! Yeah. How do you like that, richer?! Yeah, I'll bet it is! Uh huh, looks like it. Yeah! Yeah, that's where the first-class seating is!  ''We shall perservere. We shall perservere.'' Yeah! ''We shall perservere. We shall perservere.''  He's cute, isn't he?  What are you doing here, boy? Very well, walk this way.  You're not becoming a lion. The only way you can do that is to see Aslan. Yes.   Is this the boy who's been living in our realm? M-I am. So, you want to live with the lions, do you? And what makes you think you can fit it with us? Do you like jokes? Jokes! You know, funny, hahaaa. Us lions love jokes. Mmm. Then there may be hoipe in you yet, young apprentice lion. Very well. We wihill let you stay, if... you can pull this thorn from my paw.  He-you may. But being a lion may be harder than you think. Yes? What is it, young lion apprentice? Home. But I thought your friends made fun of you at home. It sounds like you learned much, young lion apprentice. Very well. But before you go, perhaps you would like... a stick of gum? Go on. It's spearmint! Oh. So you don't want any gum then? Are you... sure? Go on, try it!  Hooray! Yeah! This certainly has been an enlightening evening. And as Mayor, I accept your petition and will abolish all separation laws. And I want to assure the nation that is watching that South Park is not a town of prejudice or bigotry.  Woooooo!!  Carl, do you see what I see? Pack up your things quickly! We've got to get out of here!  Ready as I'm ever going to be, I guess.  Docter, can we turn off that television?  What? Uh-I've heard of it on the news, but... I don't know what it is. Oh well, I suppose, if it can help others. Well okay.  ...going places that I've never been<br />Seeing things that I may never see a- Uuugh!  Yeah. Too bad you're not a broad, 'cause I need some God-damned poontang.  This is awful, just awful! Oh, Kenny, isn't that nice? We travel the country given special little boys and girls like you their biggest wish. So Kenny, if you could have ONE wish, what would it be?  What did he say? ...O-kay, and, what if you're gonna have two wishes, what would the second one be? Should I come in now? <poem><i>One look from you and I would fall from grace.</i></poem> <poem><i>'And that would wipe the smile right from my face.</i></poem> <poem><i>Do you remember when we used to dance? </i></poem> <poem><i>And incidents arose from circumstance? </i></poem> Seventy-five dollars?

This room's taken. Tom, I'm standing in front of the home of Chris and Linda Stotch. They're living every parent's nightmare right now, as last night, while Ms. Stotch was driving with her son in the car, a man stopped her, put a gun to her head, and took her son away. When asked who the man was, Ms. Stotch replied, "some Puerto Rican guy." Naturally, the police are in an all-out manhunt for some Puerto Rican guy.  Mrs. Stotch, what did the kidnapper look like? Mrs. Stotch? Mrs. Stotch? Any word yet from the man who took your son? Was he tall? Short? Let us handle it.  Barbrady? Really?  Chief! Two more parents from the next town over have shown up saying their child might have been killed by the same guy that took the Stotch boy.  This is John and Patsy Ramsey, from Boulder.  We saw your story on the news, and we were so sorry to hear about your loss. A and we realized... The man that murdered your son must be the same person that killed our daughter! No, huh. It's so very hard to lose a loved one, isn't it?  Hello, Gary. Great to see you. Chris and Linda, this is our good friend, Congressman Gary Condit.  He also lost someone close to him and thinks it something to do with the same Puerto Rican guy that hurt our kids. So you see, Chris and Linda, there are people like you all over the country who've been affected by some Puerto Rican guy. Yeah! Our daughter was killed a few years ago, in our house. Yes, because we certainly didn't do it! No.  No. Thank goodness we have each other to share our grief. Oh, good. Maybe now they'll catch him.  O.J. O.J.'s wife was killed by an uh, some Puerto Rican guy, too. Yeah!  One of us! One of us! Riiight.  Hallo, what can I do for ya? Sarrih, wife took the car to Estes Park for the weekend. Won't be back until Sunday, hyeah. I can give you a ride Sunday, if ya like. Well, then, looks like you're walkin'. 'Aht road leads to Conifuh. You want to go to South Park, you gotta go down that rod.  'Course, I ain't nevuh seen anyone go up that rod. Six years ago a group of campers went up there and got lost. Had to eat each other to say alive. Used to be the way to O'Riley house. He butchered over fifty children and kept their bodies in a cellah. But, you should find an old bridge about halfway up. That bridge is cursed, you know? They built it with the bones of two hundred Chinese laborers who were massacred in '34. Yeah. Lotta history down that rod.
