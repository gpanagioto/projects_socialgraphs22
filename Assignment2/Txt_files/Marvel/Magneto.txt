'''Magneto''' ({{IPAc-en|m|æ|g|ˈ|n|iː|t|oʊ}}) (birth name: '''Max Eisenhardt'''; [[Pseudonym|alias]]: '''Erik Lehnsherr'''{{Need-IPA}} and '''Magnus''') is a [[fiction]]al [[Character (arts)|character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]], commonly in association with the [[X-Men]]. Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist/co-writer [[Jack Kirby]], the character first appears in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|The X-Men]]'' #1 ([[cover-date]]d September 1963) as an adversary of the X-Men.

The character is a powerful [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], one of a fictional subspecies of humanity born with superhuman abilities, who has the ability to generate and control [[magnetic field]]s. Magneto regards mutants as evolutionarily superior to humans and rejects the possibility of peaceful human-mutant coexistence; he initially aimed to conquer the world to enable mutants, whom he refers to as ''homo superior'', to replace humans as the dominant species. Writers have since fleshed out his origins and motivations, revealing him to be a [[Holocaust survivors|Holocaust survivor]] whose extreme methods and cynical philosophy derive from his determination to protect mutants from suffering a similar fate at the hands of a world that fears and persecutes mutants. He is a friend of [[Professor X]], the leader of the X-Men, but their different philosophies cause a rift in their friendship at times. Magneto's role in comics has progressed from [[supervillain]] to [[antihero]] to [[superhero]], having served as an occasional ally and member of the X-Men, even leading the [[New Mutants]] for a time as headmaster of the [[X-Mansion|Xavier School for Gifted Youngsters]].

Writer [[Chris Claremont]], who originated Magneto's backstory, modeled the character on Israeli terrorist-turned-statesman [[Menachem Begin]],<ref>{{cite web |last1=Foege |first1=Alex |title=The X-Men Files |url=https://nymag.com/nymetro/arts/features/3522/ |website=New York Magazine |publisher=Vox Media, LLC |access-date=4 April 2022 |date=17 July 2000}}</ref> with later commentators comparing the character with the American [[civil rights]] leader [[Malcolm X]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Godoski |first=Andrew |url=http://www.screened.com/news/professor-x-and-magneto-allegories-for-martin-luther-king-jr-and-malcolm-x/2316/ |title=Professor X And Magneto: Allegories For Martin Luther King, Jr. And Malcolm X |publisher=Screened |date=2011-06-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110618141805/http://www.screened.com/news/professor-x-and-magneto-allegories-for-martin-luther-king-jr-and-malcolm-x/2316/ |archive-date=2011-06-18 |access-date=2016-05-08 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last = Shutt | first= Craig | date = August 1997 | title = Bad is Good | work = [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]] | issue = 72 | page = 38}}</ref> and [[Jewish Defense League]] founder [[Meir Kahane]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forward.com/articles/7470/ |title=''(Orthodo)X-Men, On Screen and Off'', Irving Greenberg, Jewish Daily Forward, 13 June 2003 |publisher=Forward.com |date=2003-06-13 |access-date=2012-08-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/articles/8878/orthodo-x-men-/|title=(Orthodo)X-Men|author=Ami Eden|date=2003-05-23|publisher=Jewish Daily Forward}}</ref> Magneto opposes the pacifist attitude of [[Professor X]] and pushes for a more aggressive approach to achieving civil rights for mutants.

[[Ian McKellen]] has portrayed [[Magneto (film character)|Magneto]] in various films since [[X-men (film)|X-Men]] in 2000, while [[Michael Fassbender]] has portrayed a younger version of the character in the [[X-Men (film series)|prequel films]] since ''[[X-Men: First Class]]'' in 2011. Both actors portrayed their respective incarnations in ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]''.

==Publication history==
[[File:Magnetodebut.png|thumb|upright|''X-Men'' #1 (Sept. 1963) is Magneto's first appearance. Written by [[Stan Lee]] and art by [[Jack Kirby]].]]

Magneto [[First appearance|first appeared]] in the debut issue of ''The X-Men'' in 1963.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Press|first=Ivy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7TeJMLUqueMC&q=magneto+first+appearance&pg=PA71|title=Heritage Comics Dallas Signature Auction Catalog #820|date=May 2006|publisher=Heritage Capital Corporation|isbn=978-1-59967-044-7|pages=71|language=en}}</ref> Through the 1960s, Magneto appeared in several issues of the original X-Men comics, including ''The Uncanny X-Men'', ''X-Men'', ''[[Astonishing X-Men]]'', ''[[Alpha Flight (comic book)|Alpha Flight]]'', ''[[Cable (comics)|Cable]]'', ''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'', ''[[The New Mutants]]'', many X-Men [[miniseries]], and several other Marvel titles. His first solo title was a [[one shot (comic)|one-shot]] special, ''Magneto: The Twisting of a Soul'' #0 (Sept. 1993), published when the character returned from a brief absence; it reprinted Magneto-based stories from ''Classic X-Men'' #12 & 19 (Aug. 1987 & March 1988), by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[John Bolton (comics)|John Bolton]].

In a 2008 interview, Stan Lee said he "did not think of Magneto as a bad guy. He just wanted to strike back at the people who were so bigoted and racist... he was trying to defend the mutants, and because society was not treating them fairly he was going to teach society a lesson. He was a danger of course... but I never thought of him as a villain."<ref name="celeb57">''Marvel Spotlight: Uncanny X-Men 500 Issues Celebration'', pp. 5-7</ref> In the same interview, he also revealed that he originally planned for Magneto to be the brother of his nemesis [[Professor X]].<ref name="celeb57"/> 

Writer [[Chris Claremont]] stated that [[Menachem Begin]] was an inspiration for Magneto's development, as [[David Ben-Gurion]] was for Professor X. "There's a lot of talk online now that Magneto stands in for Malcolm X and Xavier stands in for Martin Luther King, which is totally valid but for me, being an immigrant white, to make that analogy felt incredibly presumptuous. An equivalent analogy could be made to [Israeli prime minister] Menachem Begin as Magneto, evolving through his life from a terrorist in 1947 to a winner of the Nobel Peace Prize 30 years later."<ref>{{cite web|title=The X-Men Files|last=Foege|first=Alec|url=https://nymag.com/nymetro/arts/features/3522/}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Exclusive: X-Men's Chris Claremont talks through five key storylines|last=Lynskey|first=Dorian|url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/x-men-wolverine-jean-grey-chris-claremont-five-key-storylines}}</ref>

Asked about the [[Malcolm X]]/[[Martin Luther King Jr.]] parallels, Claremont also said "It was too close [in the 1970s]. It had only been a few years since the assassinations. In a way, it seemed like that would be too raw. My resonance to Magneto and Xavier was borne more out of the Holocaust. It was coming face to face with evil, and how do you respond to it? In Magneto's case it was violence begets violence. In Xavier's it was the constant attempt to find a better way... As we got distance from the '60s, the Malcolm X-Martin Luther King-Mandela resonance came into things. It just fit."<ref>{{cite web|title=Real Life Inspirations Behind Some of the Best Comic Book Villains|last=Young|first=Paul|website=[[Screen Rant]] |date=30 March 2014|url=http://screenrant.com/best-comic-book-villains-real-life-inspiration/}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The secret to 'X-Men's' success|last=Hanks|first=Henry|website=[[CNN]] |url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/SHOWBIZ/Movies/06/03/xmen.legacy.go/}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Ages of the X-Men:Essays on the Children of the Atom in Changing Times|last=Darowski|first=Joseph J.|page=71}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Unauthorized X-Men: SF and Comic Writers on Mutants, Prejudice, and Adamantium|page=23|author=DeCandido, Keith R.A., Haber, Karen, Wein, Len|date=April 1, 2006|publisher=Benbella Books|isbn=1-932100-74-1}}</ref>

Magneto's first original title was the four-issue miniseries ''Magneto'' (Nov. 1996-Feb. 1997), by writers [[Peter Milligan]] and Jorge Gonzalez, and [[penciller]] [[Kelley Jones]]. In the miniseries, Magneto had been de-aged and suffered from amnesia, calling himself [[Joseph (comics)|Joseph]]; it was later revealed that Joseph was a younger clone of Magneto. Later, Magneto became ruler of the nation [[Genosha]]. Later, Magneto appeared in two miniseries; ''Magneto Rex'' (written by Joe Pruett and drawn by Brandon Peterson) and ''Magneto: Dark Seduction'' (written by Fabian Nicieza and drawn by Roger Cruz).

A trade paperback novel detailing Magneto's childhood, ''X-Men: Magneto Testament'' was written by [[Greg Pak]] and released in September 2008. Pak based ''Magneto Testament'' on accounts from [[Holocaust survivors]]. Before the publication of ''X-Men: Magneto Testament'', Magneto's personal background and history were invented<ref>{{cite news | author = Mordechai Shinefield | title = X-Men mutant survives the Holocaust in new Marvel Comics miniseries | work = [[Haaretz]] | date = 2008-06-07 | url = http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/990901.html | access-date=2008-06-09}}</ref> in ''The Uncanny X-Men'' #150 (Aug. 1981).

==Fictional character biography==

===Early life===
[[File:magnetoholoc.png|left|(Left) Max and Magda escape from the [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]] [[death camp]]; (Right) Max and Magda with their daughter Anya. Art from ''X-Factor'' Annual #4 (1989) by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]].|thumb]]

Magneto was born "'Max Eisenhardt'" sometime in the late 1920s to a middle-class [[History of the Jews in Germany|German Jewish]] family. Max's father, Jakob Eisenhardt, was a decorated [[World War I]] veteran.<ref name="testament1"/> Surviving discrimination and hardship during the [[Nazism|Nazi rise to power]], the passing of the [[Nuremberg Laws]] in 1935, and [[Kristallnacht]], Max and his family fled to [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] where they were captured during the [[Invasion of Poland|German invasion of Poland]] and sent to the [[Warsaw Ghetto]].<ref name="testament1"/><ref name="classicxmen12">''Classic X-Men'' #12</ref> Max and his family escaped the ghetto, only to be betrayed and captured again. His mother, father, and sister were executed and buried in a mass grave, but Max survived, possibly due to the manifestation of his mutant powers. Escaping from the mass grave, he was ultimately captured yet again<ref name="mutants1">''The New Mutants'' #49</ref> and sent to [[Auschwitz]], where he eventually became a ''[[Sonderkommando]]''.<ref name="mutants1"/><ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #274</ref><ref>''Excalibur'' vol.3 #14</ref> While at Auschwitz, Eisenhardt reunited with a [[Romani people|Romani]] girl named Magda, whom he had fallen in love with when he was younger, and with whom he would escape the concentration camp during the [[Auschwitz concentration camp#Birkenau revolt|October 7, 1944 revolt]].

Following the war, he and Magda moved to the Ukrainian city of [[Vinnytsia]], and Max adopted the name "'''Magnus'''". Magda and Magnus had a daughter named Anya, and lived uneventfully until an angry mob, spurred on by the first manifestation of Magnus' powers, burned down their home with Anya still inside. Magnus was enraged at the mob for preventing him from rescuing Anya, and his powers were unleashed, killing the mob and destroying a part of the city. Magda, terrified at Magnus' power, left him and later gave birth to the mutant twins [[Quicksilver (comics)|Pietro]] and [[Scarlet Witch|Wanda]] before she died. Wanted by the authorities for the deaths and destruction in Vinnytsia, and while searching for Magda, Magnus paid a Romanian forger, Georg Odekirk, to create the cover identity of "'''Erik Lehnsherr''', the [[Sinte]] gypsy".<ref name="xmen72">''X-Men'' Vol. 2 #72 (February 1998)</ref> "Erik" moved to [[Israel]], where he met and befriended [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]] while working at a psychiatric hospital near [[Haifa]], where [[Gabrielle Haller]] lived. There, the two debated the consequences humanity faced with the rise of mutants, though neither revealed to the other that they were mutants. However, they were forced to reveal their inherent abilities to one another while facing [[Baron Strucker]] and [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]]. After the battle, Erik, realizing that his and Xavier's views were incompatible, left with a cache of hidden [[Nazi gold]], which provided him with the finances to pursue his goals.<ref name="uncanny1"/>

===Rise of Magneto===

Magneto's experiences during the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] ([[Nazi Germany]], [[Auschwitz]], and [[Vinnytsia]]) shaped his outlook on the situation that mutants face in the [[Marvel Universe]]. Determined to keep such atrocities from ever being committed against mutantkind, he is willing to use deadly force to protect mutants. He believes that mutants ("''Homo superior''") will become the dominant life form on the planet and he sets about either creating a homeland on Earth where mutants can live peacefully, or conquering and enslaving humanity in the name of mutantkind.

Magneto's first villainous act is attacking a United States military base called Cape Citadel after bringing down missiles. He is driven off by Charles Xavier's mutant students, the [[X-Men]], in their first mission.<ref>''The X-Men'' #1</ref> He creates Asteroid M, an orbital base of operations in a hollowed-out asteroid. He then gathers a group of angry and disillusioned mutants including his own, albeit at the time unbeknown to him, son and daughter [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] and the [[Scarlet Witch]], and formed the [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] to further his goals. Magneto briefly conquers the South American nation of San Marco in the hopes of establishing a mutant homeland there, but is again foiled by the X-Men.<ref>''The X-Men'' #4</ref> He tries to make the [[Toad (Marvel Comics)|Toad]] infiltrate the X-Men. When that fails, he captures the [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]] and tries to force him to tell the secrets of the X-Men. However, the other X-Men rescue their member and destroy Asteroid M.<ref>''The X-Men'' #5</ref>

Magneto is captured by the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]], a powerful alien being, whom he initially thought was another powerful mutant. The Stranger encases Magneto and Toad in a special cocoon and spirits them away to another planet, the Stranger's laboratory world. Back on Earth, Magneto's Brotherhood splinters, and Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch desert him.<ref>''The X-Men'' #11</ref> Magneto escapes to Earth by repairing a spaceship on the Stranger's planet, but leaves the Toad behind. He captures nearly all the X-Men and takes over the Mansion, hoping to use the Angel's parents to create a race of mutants, but is recaptured by the Stranger.<ref>''The X-Men'' #17-18</ref> Magneto remains on the Stranger's world for a time, but escapes again thanks to the unwitting assistance of scientist [[Dane Whitman]], makes his way back to Earth, and reassembles the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants with the exception of the mutant [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]].<ref>''The Avengers'' #47-49</ref> He then captures the X-Men, but with the help of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and a rebellious member of the Brotherhood, Toad, Magneto is defeated again.{{issue|date=July 2013}}

Magneto then creates the [[Savage Land Mutates]]. With the Savage Land Mutates, he clashes with the X-Men and [[Ka-Zar (Kevin Plunder)|Ka-Zar]].<ref>''The X-Men'' #62-63</ref> Along with [[Namor]], Magneto later attacks New York City.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #102-104</ref> He later fights the [[Inhumans]] Royal Family,<ref>''Amazing Adventures'' #9-10</ref> and battles the Avengers once more.<ref>''The Avengers'' #110-111</ref>

Magneto later reorganizes the Brotherhood, and fights Professor X and the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]. Using ancient and advanced alien technology he found near the core of the earth, Magneto creates the artificial humanoid "[[Alpha the Ultimate Mutant]]". Alpha rebels against his creator and reduces him to infancy.<ref>''The Defenders'' #15-16</ref> Magneto is then placed in the care of Xavier's former love interest, Professor [[Moira MacTaggert]] at [[Muir Island]]. At Muir Island, MacTaggert discovers that the prolonged and extensive use of Magneto's powers has a disruptive effect on his nervous system and psyche, causing him to become increasingly paranoid and irrational the more he uses them. In an attempt to cure him of this flaw she manipulates the infant Magneto's genetic code, so that when he grows older he will be able to safely use his powers while still remaining rational, in order to prevent him from becoming "evil" in adulthood.<ref>''X-Men'' #2</ref> However, her genetic tampering soon loses its effect when Magneto reactivates his powers, as the very use of his powers causes his genetic sequence to realign and "reset" to its original state. Magneto is eventually restored to adulthood, but to his physical prime rather than his older, chronological age, by the alien [[Shi'ar]] agent [[Erik the Red (comics)|Erik the Red]].<ref>''The X-Men'' #104</ref>

Magneto later gathers a new [[Resistants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]], and with them battles [[Captain America]].<ref>''Captain America'' Annual #4</ref> He then successfully opposes [[Doctor Doom]]'s conquest of Earth.<ref>''Super-Villain Team-Up'' #14; ''The Champions'' #16</ref>

===Reformation===
[[File:uncanny200.png|thumb|Magneto goes on trial for his crimes in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #200. Art by [[John Romita Jr]].|left]]

Magneto's first steps towards a change in character begin during an encounter with the X-Men, when he lashes out in anger and nearly kills [[Kitty Pryde]], stopping short when he sees that the X-Man that he attacked is a Jewish child — precisely the kind of person he claimed he was fighting to make a better world for.  Realizing that he has come to regard the lives of those who oppose him to be as worthless as the Nazis considered his people to be, Magneto stands down and leaves the scene; though most of the X-Men are dismayed that he escaped, Xavier expresses hope that the encounter might prove a turning point for his former friend.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #150 (Aug. 1981)</ref>

Magneto later discovers that former Brotherhood members the [[Scarlet Witch]] and [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] are actually his children, simultaneously learning about their recent marriages to the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] and [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]]. He reveals to Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch that he is their father.<ref name="VSW4">''Vision and the Scarlet Witch'' #4 (Feb. 1983).</ref> He also discovers his granddaughter, Quicksilver's human child [[Luna Maximoff]].<ref name="VSW4" /> Seeing Luna as a bond to the human race he has rejected, Magneto tries to reach out to his children. Angered by his rejection of them and their mother, they push him away and refuse to forgive him.<ref name="VSW4" /><ref>''The Avengers'' #234 (Aug. 1983)</ref>

Magneto finds himself allied with Professor Xavier and the X-Men when a group of heroes and villains are abducted by the [[Beyonder]], a nearly omnipotent alien being. This entity took them to a planet he created called the [[Battleworld]] to participate in a personal experiment of his to observe the concept of the battle between good and evil which would later be known as the [[Secret Wars]]. The characters were sorted according to their desires; Magneto was placed with the heroes as his desires were based on a wish to help mutants rather than the more selfish drives of the other villains. This surprises many of the other heroes, who still believe him to be a villain, although eventually they come to accept him as an ally. [[Captain America]] even speaks in his defense on some occasions, and the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] develops a certain affection for him, although it is tempered by her knowledge of his past.<ref>''[[Secret Wars]]'' #3 (July 1984)</ref>

After the Secret Wars, Magneto is transported back to his base, Asteroid M. The alien [[Warlock (New Mutants)|Warlock]], traveling to Earth, collides into the asteroid, breaking it to pieces.<ref>''The New Mutants'' #21 (Nov. 1984)</ref> Magneto falls towards Earth and into the Atlantic Ocean, sustaining serious injuries. He is rescued by [[Lee Forrester]], the captain of a fishing trawler.<ref>''The [[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #188 (Dec. 1984)</ref> Lee takes him to the same island in the Bermuda Triangle where he'd once held her captive; there she helps him recuperate from his injuries, and the two become lovers.<ref>''The New Mutants'' #23, 24, 26, 28, 29 (Jan., Feb., April, June, July 1985)</ref>

After recuperating from his injuries, Magneto is asked to aid the X-Men in battling the returned Beyonder.<ref>''The New Mutants'' #29 (July 1985)</ref> Magneto stays with the X-Men even after the Beyonder is defeated.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #196</ref> His association with the team softens his views on humanity, and Magneto surrenders himself to the law to stand trial for his crimes. A special tribunal dismisses all charges against Magneto from prior to his "rebirth", deeming that this had constituted a figurative death of the old Magneto. However, the tribunal is interrupted by an attack from [[Fenris (comics)|Fenris]], the twin children of [[Baron Strucker|Baron Wolfgang von Strucker]]. [[Professor X]], brought to near-death due to the strain of the battle and previously sustained injuries, asks Magneto to take over his school and the X-Men. Magneto agrees and chooses not to return to the courtroom. Instead, he takes over Xavier's school under the assumed identity of Michael Xavier, Charles Xavier's cousin.<ref>''The [[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #200 (Dec. 1985).</ref> Seeing him try to reform, the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver begin accepting him as their father.<ref>''Vision and the Scarlet Witch'' #6</ref>

Though Magneto makes a substantial effort as the headmaster of the [[New Mutants]] and an ally to the X-Men, his tenure is disastrous. His responsibilities to the school force him to separate from Lee, who he felt would have been a strong guiding hand and emotional support.<ref>''The [[New Mutants]]'' #35 (Jan. 1986).</ref> The [[Beyonder]] plagues him yet again, slaying Xavier's current students, the New Mutants,<ref>''The [[New Mutants]]'' #37 (March 1986).</ref> and bringing them back to life soon after.<ref>''[[Secret Wars II]]'' #9 (March 1986).</ref> This deeply traumatizes the entire group.<ref>''The [[New Mutants]]'' #38 (April 1986)</ref> Magneto is then manipulated by [[Emma Frost]] into battling sanctioned heroes the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and the [[Supreme Soviets]].<ref>''The X-Men vs. The Avengers'' #1–4 (April–July 1987)</ref> Magneto submits to a trial once again, but uses mind-control circuitry he salvaged from the wreckage of Asteroid M to alter the opinions of the head justice in charge of the trial. As a result, Magneto is finally absolved of his past crimes but finds that this only fuels hostility towards mutants.<ref>''The X-Men vs. The Avengers'' #4 (July 1987)</ref> Feeling that desperate measures need to be taken after the [[Mutant Massacre|genocidal massacre in the Morlock tunnels]], Magneto and [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] join the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] jointly as the White King.<ref name="NM51"/> He is unable to prevent his students [[Sunspot (comics)|Roberto da Costa]] and Warlock from running away from the school,<ref>''[[Fallen Angels (comics)|Fallen Angels]]'' #1 (April 1987)</ref> or to prevent the death of the young mutant student [[Cypher (comics)|Douglas Ramsey]] after the students sneak away yet again to save a friend,<ref>''The New Mutants'' #60 (Feb. 1988)</ref> and witnesses the [[Fall of the Mutants|apparent death of all of the senior X-Men]] on national television.<ref>''The New Mutants'' #61 (March 1988)</ref>

His relationship with the New Mutants deteriorates even further when they see him and the Hellfire Club negotiating with the demons of the ''[[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]]'' incident.<ref>''The New Mutants'' #73 (March 1989)</ref> Magneto later ousts longtime Hellfire Club co-chair [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]] in order to establish himself as the head of the Hellfire Club. To win the support of the other Club members against Shaw, he claims that his reformation was all a pretense in order to use the X-Men and New Mutants as pawns in a long-term scheme to take over the world. In response, the New Mutants, who had already decided to leave Magneto's tutelage, declare themselves his enemies.<ref name="NM75"/>

Seeing conditions for mutants grow progressively more perilous, Magneto begins seeking allies to protect mutants from humanity. He participates in the ''[[Acts of Vengeance]]'' alongside such established villains as [[Doctor Doom]], the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]], the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]], and the [[Red Skull]].<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #53</ref> His temporary alliance with the Red Skull — an unrepentant Nazi war criminal — is a highly uneasy one. After confirming that the Skull was the original one who had worked with Hitler, Magneto takes revenge upon him by entombing him alive.<ref>''[[Captain America (comic book)|Captain America]]'' #367 (February 1990).</ref> When [[Zaladane]] is able to appropriate the magnetic powers of Polaris,<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #250</ref> Magneto works alongside [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], [[Ka-Zar (Kevin Plunder)|Ka-Zar]], and the American intelligence agent [[Nick Fury]] as well as a number of Russian operatives in order to reestablish peace in the [[Savage Land]].<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #274 (March 1991)</ref> This leads to an altercation with Zaladane, who appropriated the magnetic powers of Magneto in addition to those of Polaris. The conflict ends with Magneto reclaiming his powers and executing Zaladane himself. With her death, Magneto renounces his previous efforts to act as a mentor to the New Mutants and to follow Xavier's beliefs in peaceful co-existence between mutants and normal humans.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #275 (April 1991).</ref>

===Avalon and Genosha<!--'Acolytes (comics)' redirects here-->===
Tired of the constant strife, Magneto rebuilds his orbital base and retires to a life of quiet seclusion. At this point, he is a figurehead for the cause of mutantkind and is sought out by a group of mutants calling themselves the '''Acolytes'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->, who pledge their service and allegiance to him.<ref name="X-Men vol. 2 #1">''X-Men'' #1 (Oct. 1991)</ref> Under the influence of one of them, [[Fabian Cortez]], he declares Asteroid M a homeland for mutantkind, obtaining [[nuclear missile]]s from a Soviet submarine he had previously destroyed and placing them around the Asteroid pointed towards Earth.<ref name="X-Men vol. 2 #1"/>

Magneto discovers how Moira MacTaggert altered his genetic structure when he was de-aged. Enraged, he kidnaps Moira and subjects her to torture, later forcing her to use the same procedure that was used on him to alter the minds of some of the X-Men. However, when the remaining X-Men attack Asteroid M to rescue Moira and stop Magneto's plans, the Soviets launch a particle beam satellite which destroys Asteroid M and the procedure wears off; Moira had learned long ago that her procedure didn't work as a mutant's natural physiology relied on their bodies operating in a precise manner, with use of their powers restoring them to normal, and so Magneto had genuinely reformed. Betrayed and abandoned by Cortez, who had revealed Moira's actions to him to try and provoke Magneto into bringing mutants together to serve as a martyr for Cortez's own cause. Magneto refuses Xavier's pleas to escape with the X-Men back to Earth.<ref name=autogenerated16>''X-Men'' #1-3 (Oct.-Dec. 1991)</ref> Instead, the Acolyte Chrome encases him in a protective shell, saving him from the subsequent explosion. However, Chrome and the other Acolytes die.<ref name=autogenerated16/>

The [[United Nations Security Council]], in response to a resurgent Magneto, votes to activate the "Magneto Protocols" — a satellite network, in slightly lower orbit than Avalon, which skews the Earth's magnetic field enough to prevent Magneto from using his powers within, preventing him from returning to the planet's surface. In response, Magneto generates an [[electromagnetic pulse]] not only destroying the satellites, but deactivating every electric device on Earth within minutes. The X-Men respond by hacking into [[Avalon (Marvel Comics)|Avalon]]'s own computer systems to teleport a small team to the station with the aid of [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]]<ref name="XM25">''X-Men'' #25</ref> (who joined Magneto's Acolytes moments after his younger sister [[Magik (comics)|Illyana]]'s funeral<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #304</ref>). Magneto, during the battle with the X-Men, rips the [[adamantium]] from [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]'s bones, which enrages Xavier to the point that he wipes his former friend's mind, leaving him in a coma.<ref name="XM25"/> This action later leads to the creation of [[Onslaught (Marvel Comics)|Onslaught]], an omnipotent being formed from the combination of Xavier and Magneto's own dark sides, the darkness in Magneto's soul latching on to its counterpart in Xavier when he launched such a devastating assault.<ref>''X-Men'' #53</ref> Magneto remains comatose on Avalon, worshiped by his Acolytes under the leadership of the ancient mutant [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]], until Avalon itself is destroyed by the arrival of [[Holocaust (Marvel Comics)|Holocaust]] from the [[Age of Apocalypse]] Earth. During the destruction, [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] places Magneto in an escape pod sending him back to Earth.<ref>''X-Men'' #42-43</ref> This pod is intercepted by [[Astra (Marvel Comics)|Astra]], a former ally who now desires his death.<ref name="XML86"/>

After cloning Magneto, Astra restores Magneto's memories and powers before attempting to kill him. Instead, Magneto, now fully revived, battles both Astra and his clone. Magneto triumphs over the clone, sending him crashing into a South American barn.<ref name="XML86">{{cite comic | writer=[[Fabian Nicieza|Nicieza, Fabian]] | penciller=[[Alan Davis|Davis, Alan]] | inker=[[Mark Farmer|Farmer, Mark]] | story=Magneto's War: Thanks For The Memories | title=X-Men Legacy | volume= | issue=#86 | date=Mar. 1999 | publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> However, too weak to continue the battle, the real Magneto goes into hiding, while the now-amnesiac clone becomes known as [[Joseph (comics)|Joseph]] (christened as such by the nun who discovered him) and eventually joins the X-Men.<ref>''X-Men Unlimited'' #11</ref> Since the world believes Joseph to be the real Magneto, Magneto takes his time to plan.

Following this, Magneto constructs a machine to amplify his powers and blackmail the world into creating a mutant nation. The X-Men and Joseph, who had fallen under Astra's control again, oppose him.

Despite the UN's hopes that Genosha's civil war between humans and mutants would destroy or at least occupy him, Magneto crushes all opposition to his rule and rebuilds the nation by forming an army of mutants dedicated to his cause, including mutants coming from all over the world seeking sanctuary. Eventually, Magneto uses the [[Genegineer]]'s equipment to fully restore his power.<ref>''Magneto: Dark Seduction'' #4 Sept. 2000</ref> Intending to declare war on humanity, he captures [[Professor X]] to use as a symbol with which to rally his troops.<ref>''X-Men'' #111</ref> [[Jean Grey]] recruits a new group of X-Men to help Cyclops and Wolverine rescue Xavier; they defeat Magneto when Xavier psychically cuts off his access to his powers.

====The Destruction of Genosha====
While Magneto recovers from his injuries, Genosha is attacked by an army of [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] sent by Xavier's long lost twin sister [[Cassandra Nova|Cassandra Nova Xavier]]. Over 16 million mutants and humans die.<ref>''New X-Men'' #115</ref> The attack comes just after Polaris (one of the survivors) discovered the truth about her biological relationship as Magneto's daughter.

===="House of M"====
{{Main article|House of M}}
[[File:House of Magnus2.jpg|thumb|right|The House of Magnus, from left to right: [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], [[Scarlet Witch]], her two children William and Thomas, Magneto, and [[Polaris (Marvel Comics)|Polaris]].]]

During the "[[House of M]]" storyline, Magneto's daughter [[Scarlet Witch|Wanda]] suffers a mental breakdown over the loss of her children and starts to warp reality in order to recreate them, until [[Doctor Strange]] put her into a coma to stop her. In Genosha, Magneto hears Wanda's psychic cry for help and creates a [[wormhole]], whisking her away before the Avengers are able to stop her. Magneto tends to Wanda, increasingly becoming more withdrawn and angry. He allows only Xavier to visit, in the belief that Xavier can help Wanda. After months of failed attempts, the X-Men and the Avengers meet to decide what should be done. When some of the members suggest killing Wanda, [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] informs Magneto of this development, before convincing Wanda to warp reality into the [[House of M]]. In the new reality, where the New Avengers, the X-Men, and the members of Wanda's family all received their 'heart's desires', Magneto was attacked by Sentinels over Manhattan in 1979, and revealed an alleged international anti-mutant conspiracy involving [[Richard Nixon]]. This resulted in Magneto being granted sovereignty over Genosha as leader of the world's much larger and much faster growing mutant population. Magneto then turned Genosha into the most powerful, technologically advanced country on Earth, which he used as a base to dominate the world and place mutantkind above humanity.{{issue|date=February 2011}}

A group of heroes is brought together by Wolverine — who alone remembers the way the world is supposed to be because his 'heart's desire' was to regain all the memories stolen from him by the Weapon X Program — and have their own memories of the "real world" restored by [[Layla Miller]]. They band together and attack Magneto in Genosha, believing him to be the one responsible. During the battle Layla is able to restore Magneto's memories, and he confronts his son. Enraged that Quicksilver had done all of this in his name, Magneto kills him. Sensing her brother's death, Wanda resurrects him and retaliates with the phrase "No more mutants", changing the world back to its original form and [[Decimation (comics)|causing ninety-eight percent of the mutant population to lose their powers]], including Magneto. Magneto is left a broken man.<ref>''House of M'' #8</ref>

====''Son of M''====
In the 2006 miniseries ''[[Son of M]]'', which follows up "House of M", when Quicksilver comes to Genosha to restore the mutants' powers with the [[Inhumans]]' [[Terrigen Mist]]s, Magneto condemns his actions, pointing out the disastrous effects the Mists have on non-Inhumans. Quicksilver attacks Magneto with his new powers from the Mists, and savagely beats him until his own daughter [[Luna (comics)|Luna]] stops him.<ref>''Son of M'' #5, 2006</ref>

====The Collective====
Marvel's [[editor in chief]] at that time, [[Joe Quesada]], elaborated on the issue of Xorn and Magneto, stating that "Kuan-Yin Xorn came under the influence of as-yet-to-be-revealed entity that forced him to assume the identity of Magneto."<ref name="Newsarama">Quesada, Joe. [https://web.archive.org/web/20060720131757/http://www.newsarama.com/NewJoeFridays/NewJoeFridays03.html "New Joe Fridays Week 03"] URL last checked 2010-09-28.</ref> However, the issue of Xorn and Magneto was ultimately resolved during "The Collective" arc in New Avengers. A powerless Magneto is attacked by Xorn, who has somehow evolved into a being of pure energy and merged with both an energy absorbing mutant named [[Michael Pointer (comics)|Michael Pointer]] and free floating mutant power energy that manifested after Scarlet Witch depowered the bulk of the mutant population. Xorn reveals that he, of his own free will, impersonated Magneto in order to rally mutantkind against humanity but failed due to the quality of his impersonation. He possesses Magneto and briefly reactivates his powers before being defeated by the New Avengers and a cadre of heroes, including Magneto's former son-in-law Vision and Inhuman S.H.I.E.L.D. agent [[Daisy Johnson]]. [[Iron Man]], [[Ms. Marvel]], and the [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]] combine their powers and send Xorn into the Sun. Michael Pointer and Magneto are freed as a result, though Magneto is arrested and loaded into a S.H.I.E.L.D. helicopter. The helicopter, however, explodes upon take-off through unknown means as Magneto uses what was left of the energy provided to him by Xorn to escape.<ref name="ReferenceA">''[[The New Avengers (comics)|The New Avengers]]'' #20.

==="Divided We Stand"===
In the 2008 storyline "[[X-Men: Divided We Stand]]", Magneto appears, apparently at the behest of [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]] and claiming to be powerless, to help restore the broken psyche of Professor Xavier.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #208. Marvel Comics.</ref> Together they revive Xavier before being attacked by [[Joanna Cargill|Frenzy]]. Magneto wounds Frenzy by firing a medical laser into one of her eyes. Seeing the injury of a mutant as a crime, Exodus attacks Magneto. Xavier challenges Exodus on the [[astral plane]]. After Xavier defeats Exodus, he leaves Magneto and [[Karima Shapandar|Omega Sentinel]] to try and rebuild his lost memories.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #209-#210. 2008. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==="Manifest Destiny"===
Magneto, his powers artificially simulated by a suit designed by the [[High Evolutionary]], reactivates Sentinels to attack the X-Men, who had recently relocated to [[San Francisco]]. Though he is defeated, Magneto's attack serves its purpose as a distraction so the High Evolutionary can gain an unknown object from the [[Dreaming Celestial]].<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #500.

Marvel Comics.</ref> In a final bid to gain their trust, Magneto enters a deep meditative catatonic state to focus his powers at an interstellar distance and reverse the path of Breakworld's "Earth-destroyer" Metal Bullet in which [[Kitty Pryde]] is trapped. Magneto had encountered the bullet earlier while working to regain his powers with the High Evolutionary, and surmised that Kitty was inside. He had chosen to focus on ways to restore the powers of mutants, but memorized the metals of the bullet allowing him to keep a trace on it. Magneto brings the bullet back to Earth, drawing Kitty out of it and levitating her safely to the ground. However, the strain of using his power at such intensity and duration leaves him comatose.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #522. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Magneto goes public===
With his reputation around the world as a well-known mutant revolutionary/terrorist, Magneto is talked into finding a solution to the problem by Cyclops before it goes public that he is established in Utopia. With an earthquake inbound for San Francisco, Magneto uses his powers to stabilize the city's buildings, structures and metal vehicles, and to smooth the earth movements themselves, thus preventing any major damage and saving many lives.

===Ongoing ''Magneto'' series===
In 2014, Magneto starred in his first [[ongoing series]], which was written by [[Cullen Bunn]].<ref>[http://www.cullenbunn.com/pdetail/magneto Magneto, Cullen Bunn]</ref> Feeling disenfranchised by the state of mutant affairs, Magneto decides to venture off on his own to fight for mutantkind's survival on his own terms.

Marvel Comics.</ref> Magneto is captured and mind-tortured by Red Skull. He is given visions of those closest to him suffering while being unable to do anything to stop it. After being freed by Scarlet Witch, Rogue, and Havok, he bites down on a vial beneath his skin of Mutant Growth Hormone, giving himself enough power to fight.<ref>''Magneto'' vol. 3 #10. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Havok, Rogue, and Scarlet Witch want to leave the island and alert the rest of the Avengers and X-Men of what Red Skull is doing, Magneto says he's going to stay and fight. Before they can do anything, Red Skull appears.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' #24. Marvel Comics.</ref> Red Skull now has the group mind-controlled. He plans on using Scarlet Witch's power to shape reality in his image. He tells Magneto to bow if he wants his daughter to remain alive, but Magneto performs a sneak attack enough to break Red Skull's control over the others. In a fit of rage over finding mutants being used for freak medical experiments, Magneto kills the entire S-Men team. Magneto then attacks Red Skull, all while Red Skull tells Magneto that Professor X's greatest fear was him leading the X-Men. Magneto kills Red Skull while the others look on in horror. Magneto believes everything is over only for Red Skull to reappear as a giant called Red Onslaught.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' #25. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In order to combat Red Skull's Red Onslaught form, Magneto forms an unnamed group consisting of [[Absorbing Man]], [[Carnage (character)|Carnage]], [[Deadpool]], [[Doctor Doom]], [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]], [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]], [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]] V, Mystique, and Sabretooth.<ref>''Avengers & X-Men: AXIS'' #2.

==="Secret Wars"===
During the "Last Days" part of the "[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]" storyline,  Magneto had to make a choice during the incursion between Earth-616 and Earth-1610. To save the mutant race, he must attempt to destroy the world colliding with his own. To save the mutant race, he must also protect the humans, who are currently celebrating him as a hero and look on with fascination at what he attempts to do when Earth-1610 throws Sentinels against him.<ref>''Magneto'' vol. 3 #18. Marvel Comics.</ref> As the energies of Earth-616 and Earth-1610 inched closer to impact cascade and send chaos through the streets, Magneto (aided by his daughter Polaris) are taking the fight to this "other" Earth, battling the parallel Sentinels sent after them. Polaris is shocked to see the energy levels her father is exhibiting, all the while trying to protect the people caught in the crossfire of Magneto and the Sentinels. Magneto clearly has one goal in mind, as he rips a building to pieces to use against the killer robots, not caring much for the collateral damage, or the human lives at risk, as people in the building fall to the ground below. Polaris chides him for so reckless an action as she goes to the rescue while Magneto reminisces the reason he's currently exhibiting this level of power. Magneto and his current right hand Briar worked with a [[chemist]] under Magneto's employ to pump him up with a new cocktail of various drugs to amplify his powers, but Magneto needed further assistance. Months before the final Incursion happened, Briar established at least initial contact with several scientists which included Doctor Doom, Mister Fantastic, the High Evolutionary, Mister Sinister, [[Doctor Nemesis]], and Dark Beast. However, Magneto instead picked out of the lineup the Sugar Man. From him, Magneto acquires the means to initiate his plan, and thanks him in true Magneto style where he leaves Sugar Man barely alive. In the present time, Magneto continues to use the very magnetic forces of the planet to aid him, yet that's more power than he could ever channel and very quickly began taking a deadly toll on him.<ref>''Magneto'' Vol. 3 #19. Marvel Comics.</ref> As Polaris tries getting him to take a break because his plan is killing him too quickly, Magneto began thinking that he doesn't believe in resting even for a minute in his eternal war to protect everything he cares about. He recalls picking up the Sugar Man's power amplifiers and his powers go into hyper-drive and he starts having brain aneurysms. Flip to present day, Magneto sees the S.H.I.E.L.D. coming to his aid and grins. Magneto tells Polaris that their help won't be needed for much longer and she says she doesn't understand but quickly figures it out what her father meant as Magneto absorbs her power and says that it is his responsibility alone and that he couldn't let her die alongside him and that she still has something to offer the world. Magneto's powers then go nova as all the powers of the Earth's North and South Magnetic poles and all the bio-electric energies of the Earth are channelled through him and he reflects on his life role.<ref>''Magneto'' vol. 3 #20. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===All-New, All-Different Marvel===

He is first seen at the Jerusalem Habitat, welcoming several ambassadors from several countries as the newly appointed Krakoan ambassador. He guides the group through several Habitats, then reveals that he is aware of their true nature of being potential plants within Krakoa. Although he claims that he is not threatening them, he tells them that they "have new gods now."<ref>''House of X'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> 

===Judgment Day===
During the "[[Judgment Day (Marvel Comics)|Judgment Day]]" storyline, Magneto was on Arrako when Nightcrawler appeared to inform them about Destiny's vision of a war with the Eternals. Arrako was later attacked by Uranos the Undying where Magneto was one of his victims.<ref>''A.X.E.: Judgment Day'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> It turns out that he was non-lethally impaled by Uranos' fists after briefly using the metal emitted from Lodus Lugos. After Uranos left, Magneto was still alive as he states that the "seat of loss takes command".<ref>''X-Men: Red'' Vol. 2 #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Magneto is a mutant with the power to manipulate [[magnetic field]]s to achieve a wide range of effects.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://marvel.com/characters/35/magneto | title=Magneto | publisher=Marvel | access-date=May 31, 2015 }}</ref>

The primary application of his power is control over magnetism and the manipulation of both [[ferrous]] and indirectly [[nonferrous metal]] via metal ores they may contain. Magneto is also capable of creating powerful electromagnetic fields capable of moving and manipulating non-metallic objects, as well as levitating them (he can also do this via force fields). He can even perceive tachyons and a variety of antiparticles.<ref>''Avengers Academy'' #22 (Jan. 2012)</ref> While the maximum amount of mass he can manipulate at one time is unknown, he has moved large asteroids several times and effortlessly levitated a 30,000 ton [[nuclear submarine]] filled with sea water from the depths of the ocean.<ref>''X-Men'' #1 (Oct. 1991)</ref> His powers extend into the atomic level (insofar as the electromagnetic force is responsible for chemical bonding), allowing him to manipulate chemical structures and rearrange matter, although this is often a strenuous task. He can manipulate a large number of individual objects simultaneously and has assembled complex machinery with his powers. He can also affect non-metallic and non-magnetic objects to a lesser extent. He can also generate [[electromagnetic pulse]]s of great strength and generate and manipulate electromagnetic energy down to photons. He even uses the electromagnetic energy that surrounds earth to fly. He can turn invisible by warping visible light around his body.<ref>''Vision and the Scarlet Witch'' #4 (Feb. 1983)</ref> Another way in which Magneto frequently uses his power is the projection of force-fields which selectively block out matter and energy. These fields are strong enough to withstand the simultaneous detonation of multiple thermonuclear weapons, hence Magneto is invulnerable to most harm when surrounded by his shield and can survive in deep space thanks to it. He can also channel his powers through his own body to increase his strength and durability far beyond human limits and has a baseline reaction time 15 times faster than those of regular humans. On occasion he has altered the behavior of gravitational fields around him, which has been suggested as evidence of the existence of a [[Unified field theory|unified field]] which he can manipulate. He has demonstrated the capacity to produce a [[wormhole]] and to safely teleport himself and others via the wormhole.<ref>''Excalibur'' vol. 3 #8 (Feb. 2005)</ref>

Magneto has been frequently depicted as able to resist all but the strongest or most unexpected of telepathic attacks.  A number of explanations have been proposed for his unusually strong resistance to telepathy, among them: (a) technology wired into his helmet (the explanation given in several comic plotlines<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #6 (July 2001)</ref>), (b) some physical aspect of his electromagnetic powers that can interfere with telepathy (he once used the Earth's magnetic field to dampen the powers of all telepaths within his reach), (c) latent telepathic powers of his own or (d) sheer force of will (cf. ''X-Men'' #2). The theme of latent telepathic powers has been explored in a number of stories, among them the [[Secret Wars]] limited series. In some of his earliest appearances, Magneto was depicted as capable of engaging in [[astral projection]]. He has used Cerebro to locate mutants at great distances while leading the [[New Mutants]]. {{issue|date=March 2015}} He has also, on rare occasions, been shown reading others' dreams, issuing telepathic commands, and probing the minds of others.<ref>''The X-Men'' #5-7 (May–Sept. 1964), ''The New Mutants'' #38 (1986), ''X-Men vs. Avengers'' miniseries (1987), ''Marvel Fanfare'' #33 (1987)</ref> He has demonstrated the ability to shield his mind, while in intense meditation, so completely that even [[Emma Frost]] was not able to read his thoughts, despite being directly in front of him and actively attempting to do so.<ref name="Uncanny X-Men #521"/>

In addition to his powers, Magneto has many other skills. He is a [[genius]] with competence in various fields of advanced science, especially in [[genetic engineering|genetic manipulation]], particle physics, [[engineering]], and other fields of technology. He has engineered advanced weaponry, space stations, superpowered humanoid lifeforms, devices that generate volcanoes and earthquakes, that block telepathy, and that can nullify all mutant powers across a few miles except for his own.<ref name="Uncanny X-Men' 1981">''The Uncanny X-Men'' #150 (Oct. 1981)</ref> He has promptly reconstructed such computerized devices from memory.<ref name="Uncanny X-Men' 1981"/> He has bio-engineered new species including the [[Savage Land Mutates]],<ref>''The X-Men'' #62 (Nov. 1969)</ref> and, using [[Deviant (comics)|Deviant]] technology, [[Alpha the Ultimate Mutant]].<ref>''The Defenders'' #15 (Sept. 1974)</ref> He is fluent in many human languages and once single-handedly deciphered the unknown language of a lost civilization.<ref>''The Defenders'' #15 (Sept. 1974)</ref> He possesses extraordinary skill in "reading" the microexpressions on others' faces and sensing what they are thinking and feeling, whether they are lying, fearful, etc. a skill which he refers to as "taking your enemy's measure".<ref>''Avengers Academy'' #6 (Jan. 2011)</ref> He also is a master strategist and tactician with extensive combat experience, and has often been successful in single-handed combat against entire groups of superhuman adversaries. He also has some military training in hand-to-hand combat and has been shown to be effective with his fists, but he prefers to use his powers when in combat situations.

==Reception==
Magneto was ranked number 1 by [[IGN]]'s Top 100 Comic Book Villains list,<ref>IGN.com, Top 100 Comic Book Villains, [http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/1.html "Magneto is Number 1"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090518101954/http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/1.html |date=2009-05-18 }}</ref> was listed number 17 in ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard's]]'' Top 100 Greatest Villains Ever list,<ref>''Wizard'', #177, July 2006</ref> and was ranked as the 9th Greatest Comic Book Character Ever in ''Wizard'''s list of the 200 Greatest Comic Book Characters of All Time, the second highest villain on that list.<ref>Wizarduniverse.com, [http://www.wizarduniverse.com/05240810thgreatestcharacters2.html "The 200 Greatest Comic Characters of All Time"], Numbers 20 Through 1, 2008-05-23  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527233124/http://www.wizarduniverse.com/05240810thgreatestcharacters2.html |date=May 27, 2008 }}</ref>

==Other versions==
===1602===
In the alternative history of [[Marvel 1602|1602]], Magneto is known as Enrique, or the Grand Inquisitor, his true agenda a mystery. Born a Jew in the [[Venice Ghetto]], he was taken in by a Christian priest and baptized. The Christians later refused to let him return to his Jewish family, saying that giving him back to the '[[Christ-killer]]s' would damn his soul to Hell.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

Being unable to reunite with his family left him psychologically scarred. When he grew up he became the leader of the [[Spanish Inquisition]], and oversaw the Inquisition from Domdaniel. He was ordered to execute the witchbreed, but hid those who could pass off as normal. Enrique's only known followers are his children Petros and Sister Wanda (Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch, who are unaware of their parentage. Enrique is, and chooses not to tell them), and his spy in the [[Vatican City|Vatican]], Toad.  Enrique uses his position to further his needs and curry favor with influential figures, including King [[James VI and I|James of Scotland]]; towards this end, he has all 'witchbreed' killed.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

While Enrique is attempting to have  [[Archangel (comics)|Angel]] killed, the witchbreed is rescued by [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] and [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]]. This does not deter Enrique, who continues on his path until Toad is discovered to be a witchbreed by the Pope's men, and to save his own life he sells out Enrique, Petros and Wanda. The trio are set to be sacrificed, but Enrique escapes and pursues many of the other heroes to America. However, the New World is under the threat of impending doom, and [[Reed Richards|Richard Reed]] determines that to restore balance, Enrique has to co-operate.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

With the help of Nick Fury and [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], Enrique participates in the restoring of the world. He then tells his enemy, Carlos Javier, to train Petros and Wanda.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

===Age of Apocalypse===
In the reality of the [[Age of Apocalypse]], Magneto founded Earth-295's [[X-Men]] after the death of his friend [[Charles Xavier]], at the hands of Xavier's own son [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|David]] who traveled back in time to kill Magneto hoping to fulfill his "father's greatest wish".{{issue|date=February 2013}}

He and the X-Men fight against the forces of this world's [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] who, having been wakened early by the battle between David and Magneto, was able to take over [[North America]] in the absence of Xavier's interference.  [[Holocaust (Marvel Comics)|Holocaust]], [[Mister Sinister|Sinister]], [[Mikhail Rasputin]] and [[Abyss (comics)|Abyss]] are Apocalypse's horsemen, and while Magneto's team is composed not only of X-Men but also of standard "evil" mutants from traditional timelines, including mutants such as [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], other individuals who are "heroes" in [[Earth-616]] serve Apocalypse in this timeline.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

In this timeline, Magneto is married to his former protégé [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], and being able to touch due to his magnetic mastery over his own bio-aura, are able to have a son together who they name Charles, in honor of Xavier.  Magneto and Charles are later personally captured by Apocalypse himself,<ref>''Amazing X-Men'' vol.1 #3 (1995)</ref> though they are rescued by Rogue and the other X-Men, including [[Nate Grey]], who raid Apocalypse's citadel in a desperate final attempt to save all of reality from M'Kraan crystallization.<ref name="Omega">''X-Men: Omega'' (1995)</ref>

As the X-Men use the [[M'Kraan Crystal]] to send Bishop back in time to return the timeline to its proper course, Magneto and Nate Grey square off in one last fight against Apocalypse and Holocaust.  Nate Grey jams the original fragment of the M'Kraan Crystal into Holocaust, crystallizing them both, while the battle between Magneto and Apocalypse ends with Magneto using his control of magnetism to rip the techno-organic Apocalypse in half.  Following this, [[Manhattan Island]] and most of North America are enveloped in nuclear bombs.<ref name="Omega" />

It is later revealed that the day was saved by [[Jean Grey]], who manifested the Phoenix Force at the point of near-death.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

However, nobody realizes this, and everyone assumes it is Magneto, who immediately becomes a reluctant hero to a grateful humanity. The X-Men then help rebuild America in record time, and Magneto is made Federal Director of Mutant Affairs of the government of the newly restored [[United States of America]], with the X-Men deputized as a mutant police force sanctioned to bring to justice the remaining survivors of Apocalypse's regime. Just as the burden of maintaining the deception eventually begins to take its toll on an extremely stressed Magneto, he is secretly visited by Mister Sinister (who everyone has assumed to have been killed by [[X-Man]]), who reveals to him just what really happened when the bombs fell. Sinister offers his silence in exchange for Magneto's promises not to go looking for him and to let him have the body of Jean Grey, who is actually still alive.  Magneto is forced to accept for the sake of preserving the current fragile peace of global mutant-human relations, which had improved primarily due to the general public's mistaken assumption that he had personally saved the world by singlehandedly stopping nuclear armageddon. A subsequent scheme of revenge orchestrated by an embittered former X-Man later forces Magneto to confess the truth to the rest of the shocked team of X-Men.  He is nearly killed by an enraged Weapon X, but is saved by the intervention of his wife. The X-Men then proceed to stop Sinister from conquering the world using his own version of the Sinister Six (which consisted of brainwashed mutants, including this world's version of Dark Phoenix) in a violent confrontation filled with many deaths, including those of both [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] and [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]]. Grief-stricken and guilt-ridden, Magneto then voluntarily goes into U.S. government custody as penance for his deception. While in jail awaiting trial, Magneto appoints a restored Jean Grey as the new leader of the X-Men in his absence.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

===Amalgam===
In the [[Amalgam Comics]] universe, Erik Magnus is a heroic defender of Metamutants, leading his Brotherhood to save and protect them. After Sentinels created by Magneto's villainous brother [[Will Magnus|Will]] slaughter his Brotherhood, the heartbroken Erik uses Will's own technology (combined with his power over magnetism) to create a team of "Magnetic Men", each one formed from a different metal, and imbued with the personalities of his fallen comrades.<ref>''Magneto & the Magnetic Men'' #1</ref>

===Days of Future Past===
{{main|Days of Future Past}}
In this possible future, when [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinels]] rule North America, Magneto is in a wheelchair and, like the rest of the surviving X-Men save [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], held in a mutant concentration camp, his powers suppressed by an inhibitor collar. It is implied but never stated that he devised the X-Men's plan to escape from the camp and send Kate Pryde's spirit back through time. When [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]] is able to disable the inhibitors and the other X-Men flee the camp, Magneto stays behind to cover their escape and is presumably killed by the Sentinels.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

===Earth-110===
Magneto and his [[Brotherhood of Mutants]] allied with [[Doctor Doom]], [[Hulk]], [[Namor]], [[Red Skull]], and [[Ultron]] in a plot to take over [[Manhattan]].<ref>''Fantastic Four: Big Town'' #1</ref> Magneto was defeated by [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]].<ref>''Fantastic Four: Big Town'' #4</ref>

===Earth X===
In [[Earth X]], Magneto resides in Sentinel City, a city he constructed after drawing all the Sentinels to the [[Savage Land]] and using the extra forces there, destroying all the sentinels and turning them into a city. He rules there with [[Toad (Marvel Comics)|Toad]].{{issue|date=February 2013}}

After the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestial]] is removed from the Earth, the resulting shifts due to the removal of the [[vibranium]] within the Earth shifts the magnetic poles such that Magneto is depowered and Toad is given all of Magneto's powers. Toad forces Magneto to constantly dance and humiliates him at every opportunity by forcing him to become a [[court jester|Jester]]. When the vibranium is restored, Magneto's powers are restored as well. Magneto then joins the other heroes in the fight against [[Absorbing Man|Creel]].{{issue|date=February 2013}}

===Exiles/Magnus===
In the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|''Exiles'']] comics, an alternative good version of Magneto living on Earth-27 falls in love with [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]]. Magneto uses his powers to alter Rogue's DNA so they can touch and kiss. They have a child together, a son whom they name [[Magnus Lehnsherr|Magnus]], who has both his magnetic powers and a white streak in his auburn hair. Magnus quickly shows the potential to be an even more powerful master of magnetism than his father. Unfortunately, during his teens, Magnus develops his [[Secondary mutation|second mutation]], which turns anyone touched by his skin into immobile steel, never dying. Like his mother he cannot touch anyone. Magnus lives a lonely life, and is eventually forced to join the Exiles, a group of alternative reality mutants forced to repair broken realities.  The Exiles first mission involves a reality where all superpowered individuals have been either exterminated or imprisoned.  They are instructed to save the one individual who can save this broken reality. They mistakenly release a totally evil and depraved version of Professor Xavier who uses his mental powers without remorse or mercy.  Magnus dies on the team's mission after giving his life to stop a bomb set by the leader of high security prison.<ref>''Exiles'' #1-2</ref> Later the Exiles learn that Magnus' corpse is trapped inside the Crystal Palace. They free it and return it to his homeworld, where Magnus is buried by his parents.<ref>''Exiles'' #83</ref>

===Marvel Zombies===
In the reality of [[Marvel Zombies]], Magneto and his Acolytes were a few of the survivors following a plague that caused an [[zombie|undead-like]] effect in "super-powered beings". It is revealed in [[Marvel Zombies: Dead Days]] that he and Fabian Cortez made a deal with an unknown entity from another universe to damage the Earth to let mutants become the dominant force.  Though they believe it is the zombie [[Sentry (comics)|Sentry]], the zombified Reed Richards later hypothesizes that it was with an entirely different universe unrelated to the zombie plague and that Sentry's arrival was a coincidence misleading Magneto into believing he had led to the Earth' ruin.<ref>Marvel Zombies: Evil Evolution</ref>  Regretful that he has doomed the entire planet and his [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]] either dead or having retreated to [[Asteroid M]], Magneto returns to earth to help any non-infected beings left. He eventually hides out with a small group of human survivors, a female cop, a lone father and his daughter. He saves [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] of the [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate Universe]] from the Zombies and brings him to their hideout, a subway station. Magneto acknowledges the irony of working with normal humans, but believing that "Beggars can't be choosers when you're down to the last few people alive". Magneto learns the zombified Fantastic Four of his reality had tricked Reed, in a plan to allow the zombies to cross to Reed's universe for more victims. Reed and Magneto work together, first getting diabetic medicine for the young girl, then taking the civilians back to the dimensional teleporter that Reed had emerged from, although they require the aid of the rest of the Fantastic Four to do so (Magneto is the first person outside of the team to explicitly refer to the Ultimate Universe's Fantastic Four as 'superheroes'). After Richards escapes with all three of the civilian survivors and his teammates, Magneto stays behind, not wanting to die but acknowledging that he is the only one capable of destroying Richards' dimensional transporter so that the zombies won't infect Earth-1610.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

Magneto destroys the device and flees from the zombies. He is contacted by the Acolytes in Asteroid M, who offer to send a shuttle down; Magneto, however, refuses to let them risk infection, and says that he will find a way up to them somehow. As the battle with the zombies takes place, Magneto decapitates the zombie [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]] with [[Captain America's shield|Colonel America's shield]]. He attempts to decapitate the Colonel as well but only succeeds in slicing off the top half of Colonel America's brain. The latter becomes very annoyed at this, demanding double rations when Magneto is caught. Magneto is soon confronted by more zombie hordes, whom he only destroys but with little success as result of them being undead, and prepares for a final showdown. He drops many of them with a rain of metallic debris, but is swiftly bitten by the zombie [[Wasp (comics)#Marvel Zombies|Wasp]]. Magneto is pounced upon and devoured before turning, his last words being "''I hope you choke on me''!" just as [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and [[Hulk]] tear him in two as the rest of the group descends upon him.<ref>''Marvel Zombies'' #1</ref>

In Marvel Zombies 2, a group known as the "Acolytes" established a cult to Magneto in New Wakanda.{{issue|date=February 2013}} In Marvel Zombies vs. [[Age of Ultron]] Magneto is revealed to have become a zombie. Magneto is transformed into a robot zombie hybrid.

===MC2===
While he has yet to be seen in the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] comics, Magneto has inspired a few possible successors:

* '''Magneta'''-  Also known as the '''Mistress of Magnetism'''. She first appeared in the comic J2, where she attempts to start her own superhero team. She later takes up crime as a new member of the [[Revengers]] in [[Last Planet Standing]].{{issue|date=February 2013}}
* '''Charlie Philip'''- He first appeared in [[Spider-Girl (Mayday Parker)|Spider-Girl]] #44, where he wanted to become a crime fighter with magnetic power (With a device he created to wear).  He wanted to become Magneto, but without the bad attitude.  He came across Spider-Girl when he tried to steal a superhero costume as he had no money. His second appearance was in Spider-Girl #92 where he tried to secure/steal funds to become a superhero, this time posing as Magneto. He is stopped by Spider-Girl and [[X-People]] member [[Push (Marvel Comics)|Push]].{{issue|date=February 2013}}

===Mutant X===
In the [[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]] universe, Magneto is leader of the X-Men, just as he was for a time in the mainstream Earth-616 universe.<ref>''Mutant X'' #9-12</ref> Several of the X-Men, however, feel that he has strayed from Professor X's dream and split off to form a separate mutant team, the Six.<ref>''Mutant X'' #1 (Oct. 1998)</ref>

===Old Man Logan===
On Earth-807128 during the "[[Old Man Logan]]" storyline, Magneto was among the villains that united to take down each of the superheroes. Hawkeye later mentioned to Old Man Logan that he and [[Absorbing Man#Old Man Logan|Absorbing Man]] killed [[Alternative versions of Thor#Old Man Logan|Thor]].<ref>''Wolverine'' Vol. 3 #67. Marvel Comics.</ref> He ruled a section of the Western United States until was weakened by old age enough to be killed by the new [[Kingpin (character)#Old Man Logan|Kingpin]].<ref>''Wolverine'' Vol. 3 #68. Marvel Comics.</ref> A flashback revealed that he took down Hawkeye's group of Avengers with help from the [[Thunderbolts (comics)#Old Man Logan|Thunderbolts]] who were coerced by Baron Helmut Zemo. After reluctantly killing Scarlet Witch, Magneto covered this up to Baron Zemo by stating that he did not kill Scarlet Witch.<ref>''Old Man Hawkeye'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref>

On Earth-21923, Magneto's history remains the same.<ref>''Old Man Logan'' Vol. 2 #8. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===''Powerless''===
In ''[[Powerless (comics)|Powerless]]'' (which takes place in a world without superpowers), Magneto appears as a middle-aged American senator named '''Eric Magnus'''. He is involved with a shadowy government conspiracy involving mentally conditioned assassins, and is ultimately killed by Logan after arranging the death of Charles Xavier.<ref>''Powerless'' #3-5</ref>

===''Ruins''===
[[Warren Ellis]]'s [[Ruins (comics)|''Ruins'']] is a two-part parody of ''[[Marvels]]'' where the circumstances that gave the normal Marvel Universe's heroes their powers instead led to more realistic effects causing horrific deformities and deaths. The version of Magneto seen in ''Ruins'' is shown as a demonstrator protesting the corrupt regime of President Charles Xavier. His powers are uncontrollable, causing him to wear a magnetic-dampening harness around his chest. When a government agent pushes him aside and breaks the device, Magneto unwillingly brings destruction to an airport and kills the agent with a massive neural hemorrhage brought on by intense electromagnets. He meets his end when a plane gets magnetised towards him, killing many in the process.

===Ultimate Marvel===
[[File:Ultimate X-Men 62.jpg|left|thumbnail|300px|Magneto on the cover of Ultimate X-Men]]

In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] comics, Magneto, a.k.a. Erik Lehnsherr's background differs greatly from his mainstream history. He has given contradictory accounts of his past; he once told Cyclops how his entire family had died in a large scale genocide (this could indicate a similar origin as the main continuity Magneto, only that he was a descendant of [[The Holocaust|Shoah]] survivors, not a Shoah survivor himself), but he also claimed to come from a rich family with whom he no longer spoke; although it is possible the family he mentioned at that point was an adopted family, rather than his true family. In ''[[Ultimate Origins]]'' #3, it is revealed that his parents were [[Weapon X]] agents, and that he was responsible for their deaths. His wife's name was Isabelle (whom he still possibly loves), and is aware from the beginning of his familial relationship with Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch. It is also noted that he verbally mistreats them, hinting that he regards them as a living reminder of having an inter-species relationship. An arrogant fantasist who gradually sank deeper and deeper into his self-proclaimed role as Mutant Messiah, Erik Lehnsherr eventually reinvented himself as Magneto, the leader of the [[Brotherhood of Mutants#Ultimate Marvel|Brotherhood of Mutants]] and a ruthless terrorist who is willing to kill hundreds in the name of mutant supremacy.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #1</ref> Additionally, he was the one to cripple [[Professor X#Ultimate Marvel|Professor X]].<ref>''Ultimate Origins'' #5</ref>

In addition, Magneto helped Xavier to create the [[Savage Land#Ultimate Marvel|Savage Land]], using his knowledge of technology and genetics. He created an artificial language called Epsilon-Omega, based on [[Esperanto]] and featuring its [[artificial script|own script]], for mutants to use in the Savage Land, as a rejection of human languages. They even have plays, poetry and songs in this language.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

This version of Magneto is significantly darker and more cynical than the mainstream version, regarding all humans with utter and unwavering disdain and likening them to "insects". On several occasions, he has attempted to implement unflinchingly genocidal plans for humanity. More than once, dialogue refers to him actually [[cannibalism|consuming the flesh of human beings]] as he literally considers them to be animals. He commands a noticeably larger Brotherhood than his mainstream counterpart and has displayed enough power to defeat the [[Ultimates]] (even [[Thor (Ultimate Marvel character)|Thor]], a literal god, on two occasions by taking his hammer). However, Magneto does believe that humanity has done some good things as is shown in his appreciation for art, especially that of [[René Magritte]]. Magneto was imprisoned in a special plastic cell in the [[Triskelion (comics)|Triskelion]] following the events of "Return of the King", the sixth arc in the series. Aside from a brief mention in the ''[[Ultimate Six]]'' arc of [[Ultimate Spider-Man]], he was then unseen until "Magnetic North", the 12th arc and the final run for writer Brian K. Vaughan. Magneto was found to have hatched a scheme to escape, utilizing the willing cooperation of [[Forge (character)#Ultimate Marvel|Forge]] and [[Mystique (character)#Ultimate Marvel|Mystique]] as well as the unknowing but amicable aid of Longshot's mutation for luck.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

Magneto escapes by the end of the arc, leaving Mystique in his cell to impersonate him. He and Longshot then exit the Triskelion unharassed and Magneto makes it clear to Longshot that he has something different planned than any of his more typical world-domination schemes.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

Most recently, Magneto has shown up in the "Aftermath", following the death of Charles Xavier. Magneto has apparently freed Forge from prison and there are signs that he is building something. Exactly where he is hiding is still unknown, but with Charles Xavier's death he now believes it's time to speed up his plan. He takes pleasure knowing his former friend is dead (unaware that he is in fact alive and was simply transported into the future). He has a close relationship with Mystique, and arranged for her to be freed from the Triskelion by having Mastermind take her place. He has also apparently established a mutant commune. He appears in [[Ultimates|Ultimates 3]] along with the Brotherhood members Mystique, [[Blob (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Blob]], [[Sabretooth (character)#Ultimate Marvel|Sabretooth]], [[Lorelei (Mutate)#Ultimate Marvel|Lorelei]], and [[Jamie Madrox#Ultimate Marvel|Multiple Man]]). They attack the Ultimates Mansion so he can talk to Quicksilver about re-joining the Brotherhood and retrieve Wanda's body. Magneto appeared in "[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]" and revealed that the Blob is [[Liz Allan#Ultimate Marvel|Liz Allan]]'s father. He tried to recruit her into the Brotherhood.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

In the crossover event "[[Ultimatum (comics)|Ultimatum]]", Magneto uses Thor's hammer with his magnetic powers to cause worldwide devastation, flooding New York, freezing [[Doctor Doom#Ultimate Marvel|Doctor Doom]]'s country and a portion of Europe, causing eruptions of volcanoes and earthquakes in other locations. He also uses an army of suicide bombers composed of Jamie Madrox duplicates, mind-controlled by Lorelei. His army blows up the Academy of Tomorrow, including everyone inside, and the European Defense League. The suicide bombers also try to blow the Triskelion. Thanks to the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, [[Carol Danvers#Ultimate Marvel|Carol Danvers]], and [[Iron Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Iron Man]], as well as timely assistance by [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)#Ultimate Marvel|Clint Barton]] and [[Hank Pym#Ultimate Marvel|Hank Pym]]'s sacrifice, they fail to blow up the SH.I.E.L.D. base.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

Because of Magneto's actions the surviving Ultimates ([[Captain America (Ultimate Marvel character)|Captain America]], Iron Man, Hawkeye, [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Valkyrie]], and [[Hulk (Ultimate Marvel character)|Hulk]]) and some of the X-Men ([[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Cyclops]], [[Jean Grey#Ultimate Marvel|Jean Grey]], [[Storm (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Storm]], Wolverine, and [[Colossus (character)#Ultimate Marvel|Colossus]]) travel to Magneto's floating home and after a fight. [[Warren Worthington III#Ultimate Marvel|Angel]] is killed by Sabretooth and Wolverine is killed when Magneto removed the adamantium from his body after controlling Cyclops' visors and Iron Man's lasers to shoot him. Then soon after, [[Nick Fury (Ultimate Marvel character)|Nick Fury]] arrives. Due to Jean Grey's abilities to connect minds together, Magneto learns the truth about mutants: they were created accidentally by some scientific experiments and not by God's wish. Upon learning of this truth, Magneto pleads mercy from Cyclops, stating that Xavier would have done so, but Cyclops disintegrates Magneto's head with an optic blast. Following the worldwide devastation caused by Magneto, the American government brings in new anti-mutant laws.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

Recently, Magneto has resurfaced in Egypt alive where he is being worshipped as a God. Whilst doing this, he is instructing Wanda how best to ensure the protection of mutants.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: X-Men'' #07</ref> However, they are revealed to be illusions by [[Mister Sinister#Ultimate Marvel|Mister Sinister]] and [[Apocalypse (character)#Other versions|Apocalypse]].<ref>''Ultimate Comics: X-Men'' #12</ref>

===''What if?''===
There were various ''[[What If (comics)|What If]]'' issues that had Magneto as a key character:

* What if? ... "What if Magneto took over the U.S.A.?" - Following the death of Professor X, Cyclops, and Jean Grey at the hand of [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], Magneto becomes dictator of the United States uniting the [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]], the Morlocks, the Externals, Shadow King, the Nasty Boys, Fenris, the Savage Land Mutates, the Hellfire Club, and the Mutant Liberation Front. When he took over the White House, the president unleashed Sentinels which killed every mutant and non-mutant. Psylocke tried to warn Magneto about one Sentinel that carried a nuclear warhead, but it was too late. When Magneto destroyed the Sentinel, the nuclear warhead exploded killing him, Storm, Psylocke and every other mutant that was in the White House at the time. This was the Master of Magnetism's first starring role in the series, spinning out of [[Uncanny X-Men|Uncanny X-Men #269]].<ref>''What if?'' vol. 2 #47</ref>
* What if? ... "What if Legion killed Magneto?"  - Magneto is the focus of this issue, through his mere absence is a departure from the Legion Quest and Age of Apocalypse storylines.<ref>''What if?'' vol. 2 #77</ref>
*What if? ... "What if the Age of Apocalypse had not ended?" - Prominently features Magneto continuing his role as leader of the X-Men, continuing after the events shown in Age of Apocalypse.<ref>''What if?'' vol. 2 #81</ref>
*What if? ... "What if Magneto ruled all mutants?" - Magneto leads the remains of mutantkind, as they float through space on Asteroid M.  He manipulates his followers into believing a baby born among them is the next stage in human evolution beyond mutants, leading to the death of the baby.  Realizing that the baby was actually just normal and Magneto did this to keep his followers together, [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] leaves in disgust.<ref>''What if?'' vol. 2 #85</ref>
*What if? ... "What if Professor X and Magneto formed the X-Men together?" - In an alternative reality, Magneto and Xavier's confrontation with Baron Von Strucker did not end with Magneto leaving with Von Strucker's gold. Instead, he was convinced by Gabrielle Haller to let go of his hatred. Together, Magnus and Xavier formed the X-Men and were responsible for advancing the mutant cause and aiding world peace.<ref>''What if?'' vol. 3 #1</ref>

===X-Men: Fairy Tales===
In the second issue of the ''[[Marvel Fairy Tales#X-Men Fairy Tales|X-Men: Fairy Tales]]'' limited series, based on the African story '''The Friendship of the Tortoise and the Eagle''', Magneto appears as the eagle, alongside [[Professor X]] as the tortoise. Magneto/eagle has witnessed his family's slaughter when he was young, and had to teach himself to fly and survive. He has many 'demons' of his past that continue to haunt him, although while he is with his friend, [[Professor X]]/tortoise, they fade. When they come back to haunt him, he no longer believes in the friendship, thinking himself a danger to those around him.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

He also appears in the Japanese story of '''[[Momotaro|The little peach boy]]''' in which he and his children are demons who have taken over a town. They are defeated by the peach boy (Cyclops) and animals that resemble other X-Men: Beast, Angel, and Iceman.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

===X-Men: Noir===
'''Eric Magnus''' is a Chief of Detectives in the New York City Homicide Department, a firm believer in eugenics, and leader of the secret society that rules over most organized crime in the city, the Brotherhood. His son, [[Quicksilver (comics)|Peter]], a former track star, has just joined Homicide, and his daughter, [[Scarlet Witch|Wanda]], is a local socialite who started a relationship with reporter [[Angel (Timely Comics)|Tom Calloway]]. Magnus appears to owe most of his success to [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]], the latter stating that the months of practice it took Magnus to lose his eastern European accent is the only thing that Magnus didn't get from him.  Magnus's last name is revealed to be Magnisky, which the Ellis Island agent misheard as Magnus. He is currently seeking out [[Rogue (comics)|Anna-Marie Rankin]] on behalf of Shaw so that they may use her against "[[Unus the Untouchable]]", a crime boss and enemy of Shaw and Magnus.{{issue|date=February 2013}}
