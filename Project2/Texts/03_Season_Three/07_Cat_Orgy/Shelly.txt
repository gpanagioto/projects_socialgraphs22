Okay. I charge $5 for the first hour, 5% bumps every hour after that up to six hours, which enters into golden time. Bears? Alright, turd, listen up! Now that your mom is gone, I'm in charge. I don't know how you treat your other babysitters, but when ''I'm'' babysitting, you're nothing but a little turd. You're a stinky dried-up stupid turd! Got it?! My boyfriend is coming over, so you go to the kitchen, and you make us that pizza before I snap you in half like the little turd-stick you are!   Figure it out, turd! ...So I said, "you're a little turd!" and he w- ...But when you've seen one turd, you've seen them all.  ...stupid turd! The one night- Oh. Hold on a second, Carrie.  I placed his underwear over his head. Well, ''I'm'' watching ''Friends'', turd!   Hey, Skyler. He's my boyfriend!  He's 22!  You're a turd! You're the Turdman of Alcatraz! Turd wedgie. Come in the kitchen, Skyler. There's refreshments  No, Skyler. Quit it. Eight days tomorrow. I don't know, Skyler. It's just kind of strange to me that you're 22 and all. Well, maybe just one kiss. Go on, Astroturd! Turd Rock From the Sun! We left you some crusts!  Guess again, Richard the Turd! You're such an amazing poet, Skyler.  Skyler, not here.  Really? Wow! O Skyler, I love you.  What the-?  Give me that picture! Open this door, Turdledove! Your mom doesn't get home for three more hours! That's plenty of time for me to make a turd sandwich out of you.   Give me that picture, turd!  Who is that?! Skyler, your band can't practice here. Just keep the volume down! I have to go deal with Turdboy.   Hey Eric! Your mom's been in an accident! We need to run over to the hospital and identify her body! We'll be right back. Not really. She's dead.  Haha! That was a turd trick. Your mom isn't really dead! HAha! I knew you sent the cat, and that's why I went outside and got him!  Honestly? I think you guys need some work. I just think your sound is kind of... last week. Well, I ''do'' have a song I wrote. Nnno, Skyler, I'm embarrassed! ''In a world that's full of turds. TURDS!'' We're going outside to watch a meteor shower! I'm locking you in your room 'til we get back in, turd! Wha-? What the hell is wrong with you?! How come you're not yelling and whining?! What?! No you don't! ...Oh, all right, get your turd coat. You can come see the meteor shower with us. But don't bug me and Skyler! Come on! Shut up, turd! What are you doing? Go away, turd! No. NO!  No, Skyler, I'm not putting out for you! 'Cause I'm twelve!  No! What?? But I thought you liked me.  I can't believe I trusted him. I'm so ''stupid.'' Nobody my age would go out with me 'cause I'm too ugly. You don't think so? You're right! He ''is'' a scumbag! I wish I could get him back! I just don't know how. Huh? Really? You would do that? This won't take me long! I'm almost done.  They're having a cat orgy! Your mom's gonna get home soon. We're gonna get busted! Come on! We've got to get the house clean before your mom gets home.  You know, Eric. It's kind of cool that two people who hated each other can be friends. No! It's Eric's fault. He let those cats in here. Wow, she passed out. Well, let's clean up the house. Looks like everything turned out o-kay.
