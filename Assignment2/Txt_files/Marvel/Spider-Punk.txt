==Fictional character biography ==
===Spider-Verse===
During the "[[Spider-Verse]]" storyline, the Earth-138 version of Spider-Man is revealed to be Hobart Brown, originally operating as Spider-Punk. He is a homeless teenager who was transformed by a spider that was irradiated as part of President [[Norman Osborn]]'s toxic waste dumping. He becomes the punk-rock inspired Spider-Man, leading the downtrodden people of New York against Osborn's [[Alternative versions of Venom#Spider-Verse|V.E.N.O.M.]] troops. Spider-Punk managed to kill Osborn during a riot by bashing the President with his guitar. After President Osborn's death, Spider-Punk unmasked himself to the viewing crowd as their savior.<ref>''Spider-Verse'' #2.

During the "[[Spider-Geddon]]" storyline, Spider-Punk is shown to be fighting [[Thunderstrike (Eric Masterson)|Thunderstrike]] while the other Web Warriors are dismantling Loomworld.<ref>''Superior Octopus'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Spider-Punk (who is starting to call himself Spider-Man) takes down Thunderstrike. When Spider-Punk states to Eric Masters to carry a message to the [[Red Skull]] about taking the Bowery, Eric is then reduced to a skeleton by [[Kang the Conqueror|Kang the Conglomerator]] who claims that he has the rights to his name in the future for his company KangCo. When Spider-Punk goes on the attack, Kang summons some Spider-Punk dolls to assist him. After fighting them, Spider-Punk gets away from them and asks for a tape from [[Flag-Smasher|Captain Anarchy]] who is busy fighting the Annihilation Wave when they emerged in Harlem from the Negative Zone. When the Spider-Punk dolls catch up, they get into a fight with the Annihilation Wave where one of them eats the tape that Captain Anarchy was going to give to Spider-Punk. After getting the tape out of the insectoid's mouth, Spider-Punk is surprised when Kang catches up to him. As Captain Anarchy holds Kang off, Spider-Punk swings away. Meeting up with [[Alternative versions of the Hulk#Spider-Geddon|Robbie Banner]], Hobie tries to convince him to help while reminding him of how he helped in battles against the [[U-Foes]], the [[Universal Church of Truth]], and Hydra. When Kang catches up again, Robbie plays the tape and becomes the Hulk to attack Kang. When Kang is defeated, he states that Captain Anarchy is not marketable and died old while Hobie died young. After Kang disappears with Hulk confused on what Kang meant, [[Spider-Girl (Mayday Parker)|Spider-Girl]] shows up and states that something big is coming, and Spider-Punk agrees to go with her.<ref>''Edge of Spider-Geddon'' #1.
