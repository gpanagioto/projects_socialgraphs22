Uh uh, have a seat, Mr. Morris. Uh... S-Sexual Harassment Panda. Uhâ€”M-m-m-Mr. Morris, we at the school board have been thinking, and, we've decided that perhaps a "panda" isn't the best way to explain sexual harassment to children.  ...I'm afraid we're just going to have to let you go. That's thirty-two more lawsuits in the past twenty-four hours. Looks like we'll have to cut all counseling and nutrition programs. Holy smokes, you're right! Ugh!  P-please! Don't sue us. Oh! Well, uh... We had to let him go.  D'uh. I mean, he left. 
Enough, enough!  Just think about somethin' else. Think about clouds and beaches. Don't think about his supple, soft little body. Fight your urges, Mr. Broflovski! I can't help you if you won't admit you need help!! Now sit down!  Look at this young man. Just look. Don't rape. Fight it. Fight it! Okay, so what are some other things that we can do ''besides'' molest our children? Sure, "see a movie"'s good.  We could see a movie instead of molesting our children. What else? Uh huh. I'll put ah, "knitting, sewing."  Who's got another one? Nonono, we're looking for things to do ''besides'' molesting our children. Fishing's good. Uh huh.
