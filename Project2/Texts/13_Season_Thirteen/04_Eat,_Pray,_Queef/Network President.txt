That's right. It's a hot new Canadian show we're trying out. You think farts are funny; why not queefs? Eh, look guys, women are starting to be the driving force behind the television audience! You know, women empowerment and the get-go. So we want to try to appeal to the female sensibility. Sorry guys, but if you ask me, your farts have gotten stale! Terrance and Phillip, you've put on a terrific show for many many years. You've made Canada Channel what it is today. You're fired. Sorry guys, but this queefing thing is really catching on.
