 So just like that? Your parents sold your house and everything? Why would your sister wanna get addicted to those things? What are you talking about? Ike! Ike, do you have a vaping pen?! Dude! Gimme that!  What is this?  Are you joking?! Why do you want nicotine?! These things are bad for you! Do you understand?! Bad kindergartners! That's gotta be him. I'm gonna tell him if he sells a vape pen to my brother again, I'm gonna kick his ass!  Butters, are you selling vapes? WHAT?! I need to speak with the principal. I'd rather just talk to him. You know what I'm up to!  Don't touch me! Don't- touch me! You're selling it to kindergartners! You're such penises! You're so full of shit. Ronan Farrow? No he wasn't. Fine. But no more pushing it on little kids! You got that?! Just stop. It's so obvious what you guys are doing.  Can I talk to you for a second? Can I talk to you over here?  What did I say about pushing it on little kids?! Fun, fruity Vaping Man?! All right, how much do you owe the dealer? How much?! Look, my friend is very stupid and should have never gone into business with you.  I'm just seeing if I can help settle things. You probably don't realize it, but vaping is a really big problem at our school. Okay, look, this is the money I've saved up from my past three birthdays. Can we call this even and end it? What? Cartman, what are you doing?? Oh shit! Wha-what? What are you doing?? WHAT?! Mr. Mackey, I need to talk to you about some things going on at school. You know what I'm doing here! NO. Mr. Mackey, there's a big operation going on at the school Things are getting out of control- -and you need to know what's going on! What?! Let go of me!  What's bad?! You guys decided to beat up the dealer! How?! We are all in this together, Kyle! We gotta rob the vape shop, and then we can put this all behind us. Aah! Just shut up and keep pumping! Awww, shit! Mr. Marsh! All right, listen. I should have talked to an adult from the beginning. There are these three vaping syndicates at our school- -and these guys are one of them. They had someone buying stuff from here for them, and then they sold it to kids. The sixth graders, these guys, and Becky Thompson are all at each other for control of the playground. I was going to tell an adult, but these guys said they'd stop.
