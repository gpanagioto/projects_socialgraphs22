It's no trick, dude. My friend and I went to the Super Best Friends and brought him here! Okay, so um, see? This is Muhammad. When you all said you were gonna hand Muhammad over to Tom Cruise. We promised Jesus that Muhammad would stay safely in the U-Haul! If we were gonna have someone in a bear costume, why would we actually have it be Muhammad, you fucking idiot?! Kenny! Kenny! Dude, what the hell?! You're supposed to be watching Muhammad! Oh thank God. Hey Muhammad. The gingers and celebrities all want a piece of him. I don't know where we can go.  ...Yeah. Dr. Mephesto, we need your help! Dude, that doesn't matter to people right now! Alright alright, just tell Cartman who his dad is real quick so we can clone Muhammad. Come on, guys, we're running out of time!  That's not cool! We don't live in the '60s anymore, you know! We have a black president! Oh crap, the gingers! What head ginger?! And where's Cartman?! Hey look! Tom Cruise has Seaman on his back.   Yeah. Oh, dude, look.  Hey, Cartman... Yeah, dude, we, we know what it means. Look, Mr. Cruise, I'm sorry I said you were a fudge packer and that you had Seaman on your back. We do? Oh, oh, yeah, we do! We'll do better than that. We'll help you get there.
