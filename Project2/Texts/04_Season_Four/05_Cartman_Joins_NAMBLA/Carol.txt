Kenny, your dad and I are thinking about having another baby. Wouldn't you like to have another brother or sister?  Stop it! Oh, alright.  Oh, go ahead. We can make love afterwards.  What happened?! Well, Kenny, the doctor confirmed it. I'm pregnant! You're gonna have a little brother or sister. Yup, it's for sure! Don't be out too late, Kenny. We need to start movin' stuff out of your room.  Oh, well that's very sweet of you, Kenny. You made my favorite drink for me. But unfortunately, now that I'm pregnant, I can't drink. What's the matter?  Oh, it's all right.  Come on, Stuart, let's just get you to a bathroom. You can? What is it??  Bad baby, bad!  Kenny, what are you going to plunge? Aaaaaaah!   Kenny, GIVE IT UP!  Are you alright, Stuart? Our little angel, yes. What should we name him? Yes. Kenny's such a great name. My little Kenny, a brand-new Kenny. (''The new Kenny then mumbles'') Fifty-second.
