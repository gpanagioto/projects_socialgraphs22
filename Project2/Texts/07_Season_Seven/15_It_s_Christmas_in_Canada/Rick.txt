 Yes. Yes, we are. But our funding has been cut and now we're forced to ride... You're going to see the new Prime Minister. Oh, I would so like to meet him myself. It's his strange new laws that took our horses away. Perhaps I will go with you. Follow me this way! ''We're going to see the Prime Minister, the Prime Minister of Canada!'' All right boys, prepare yourselves. We're about to enter... French Canada. Just stay calm, boys. French Canadians are a little... odd.  Oh my! This certainly is a desolate place! We must be very close now. Waaaah! You're a dick, Scott! Woo, that was a close call. Thank you, kind Newfie! Ohh, that's right. Ottawa is ''that'' way.  It's okay, boys. The power is inside us to get to Ottawa! We can wish ourselves there!  Is it working? Oh yes! On the river we could travel to Ottawa in no time! Then, I suppose us mounties will never get our horses. Hey, that looks like Saddam Hussein! Wait a minute. This means all the Prime Minister's new laws are null and void. We can have our horses back! Hey, come on, boys! You can spend Christmas with us, Canada style!
