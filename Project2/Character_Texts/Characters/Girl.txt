You lied to me, Mother. You said it was the ''real'' Mr. Hankey. I will not forget this, Mother. I will not forget this, ever.  
 Give it to me! 
 Ah! 
I want Ike to be president!  
Who are you?!  Is that so, you smelly little bastard?!  In here. I'm not going in there, you stupid puddle of a homeless man urine! 
Me neither. 
Eeww. Doggie? 
Can we have horses? 
Is this the South Park Crime Unit? I lost my dolly. If I knew where it was, it wouldn't be lost. 
Hi Jimmy. 
 Ron Howard? What is it? Shut the door! 
 
I have an ear infection. What are you seeing the doctor for? 
Oh, not much, just hanging around- 
 We sometimes sneak out during recess and a friend named _________ goes and gets her cats, and we'll just cheese all day long. 
I would like to- 
Stop touching me, Elmo!  
 Mommy! 
Grandpa! 
Get him!  
Because charity-shaming hurts everyone.  
Well yes I am. How about a Snickerdoodle? 
Mommy, something stinks.  
Wow. 
Papa! Papa, no! Papa! Yeah, me too.
