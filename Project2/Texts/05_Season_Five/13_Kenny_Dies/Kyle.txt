Yeah, that was pretty good.   You've had that cough a while, Kenny. You okay? What, did he lose a hundred pounds?  Alright, Cartman! What's so important you had to pull us away from lighting cow crap on fire?! A trampoline? ...What?  I'm leaving right now!   And what the hell does that have to do with anything?! Oh, and what do you know about stem cells?! They're cells that come from fetuses, and some research show that they could be used to treat diseases. ...I hate you so much.   Yeah, they're gonna get busted again. We don't know where Cartman is, Ms. Choksondik! Aw man, here we go again! Use the Jew as a scapegoat. Alright, we don't know for sure why Cartman is ditching school, but it has something to do with abortion. That's all we know. Kenny's sick? Wait. Kenny's going to die? Cartman.  Kenny's in the hospital. They told us he has a m-muscular disease. An and, that ...and that he, he might die.   Hey dude, how's it going? Heh, don't, don't tell him what it is, dude. Hey, uh- we were all just talkin' about how when you get better, we're all gonna go down to Stark's Pond again and go camping. Huh, Stan?  Stan, where are you going? Dude, he needs us right now. I, I know it's tough but-  I know it's tough, okay?! I know! But we have to be tough right now! Look, however hard you think it for you, it's a lot harder for him! Stan, you can't leave!  Cartman? Cartman, were you... crying? Hey Cartman.   Sure you will, Cartman. Sure you will. ...And see? Here's one from Butters. It says, "We can't wait to see you back in school, Kenny." And it has a picture of him and you in a little airplane!  Stan? Oh. Well, no, there's nothing here from Stan, but, well, Stan's gonna come and see you real soon, I bet, Kenny. Neat, huh Kenny? He said his wish is not to die.  He said Madonna is an old anorexic whore who wore out her welcome years ago, and that now she suddenly speaks with a British accent and she thinks she can play guitar and she should go fuck herself.  He just... He just... stopped breathing. And it was over. He just said... "Where's Stan?" What, Cartman? I actually hugged you. I held you in my arms and, and, cried with you. AAARGH!
