 Wendy Testaburger to the principal's office please? Wendy Testaburger to the principal's office. Wendy, I've been hearing rumors about a fight between you and Eric Cartman. Oh no? Are you sure? I see.  I've noticed all the things you've done for Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Did you know I'm a breast cancer survivor? I was diagnosed seven years ago. Cancer is... pure evil. It is a fat little lump that needs to be... destroyed.  When there is a cancer, you have to "fight" it. You can't reason with cancer, you can't wish it away. Cancer doesn't play by the rules, so neither can you. And you can't listen to what anybody else tells you.  take everything. Do you understand? When you have cancer you fight, because it doesn't matter if you beat it or not. You refuse to let that fat little lump make you feel powerless!
