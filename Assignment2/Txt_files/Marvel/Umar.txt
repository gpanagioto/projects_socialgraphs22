'''Umar''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|uː|m|ər}}) is a [[fictional character|fictional]] character appearing in publications by the [[American comic book|American publisher]] [[Marvel Comics]], usually in stories featuring [[Doctor Strange]], for whom she serves as an adversary. Created by writer [[Roy Thomas]] and artist [[Bill Everett]], the character first appeared in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #150 (November 1966).

A resident of the "Dark Dimension" of the Marvel Comics [[multiverse (Marvel Comics)|multiverse]], Umar is a Faltine, a higher-dimensional energy being trapped in human form. She is the sister of [[Dormammu]], a major adversary to Earth's Sorcerer Supreme, Doctor Strange, and the mother to Strange's love interest, [[Clea]], through which she has served as recurring enemy of Strange herself. Her powers have been depicted as exceeding those of Earth's sorcerers, including Strange, making defeating her very difficult.<ref name=ScreenRant>{{cite web|author=Gerber, Jamie|url=https://screenrant.com/most-important-doctor-strange-villains-loki-mordo/|publisher=[[Screen Rant]]|title=15 Doctor Strange Villains That You Need To Know About|date=November 5, 2016|access-date=November 8, 2019|archive-date=November 8, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191108010955/https://screenrant.com/most-important-doctor-strange-villains-loki-mordo/|url-status=live}}</ref> Umar and Dormammu have been historically depicted in a constant battle over the throne of the Dark Dimension, a mystical realm to which they had initially been banished by their people, over which Dormammu typically rules,<ref>Conroy, Mike.

==Publication history==
{{expand section|date=November 2019}}
Umar first appeared in [[Marvel Comics]]' ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #150, in a [[Doctor Strange]] story written by [[Roy Thomas]], and illustrated by [[Bill Everett]] under the editorial eye of [[Stan Lee]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=388}}</ref> In the final panel of the previous month's ''Strange Tales'' #149 (written by [[Denny O'Neil]]), however, her debut appearance was foreshadowed under a different name.

<blockquote>NEXT MONTH... The dramatic defeat of ''[[Kaluu]]'' -- and the introduction of the intriguing and totally unforgettable villainess of all time -- KARA Can you ''afford'' to miss it!<ref>O'Neill, Denny & Lee, Stan, ''Strange Tales'' #149 (Marvel, Oct 1966). Marvel Comics (New York).</ref></blockquote>

The cover of #150, however, ran the teaser "Exit Kaluu... enter Umar!" with her initial rendering. Appearing within on the final (tenth) page, Umar then spends most of issue #151 as a narrative tool, recapping the events which occurred during her banishment, for the benefit of the returning and new readers alike.

She has served as a major adversary Earth's Sorcerer Supreme, Doctor Strange. Her family ties would lead her to cross paths with Doctor Strange many times during the course of her publication history, during which she would work with her brother against Strange, and was not above exploiting Strange's romantic relationship with Clea to manipulate the sorcerer.<ref name=CBR7.25.19/>

In 2005 Marvel published the miniseries ''Defenders: Indefensible'', by [[Keith Giffen]], [[J.M.

In ''Defenders'' (Vol 2) #3 (November 2005), Umar uses her magic to enchant the Hulk in order to seduce him and [[rape|take advantage of him sexually]], but is frustrated that the act of copulation with him lasts only six minutes, and angered when he reverts to his human form of Bruce Banner. The scene that drew criticism for its treatment of what was an act of [[rape|non-consensual sex]].<ref name=Gizmodo>{{cite web|author=Bricken, Rob|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-8-least-incredible-adventures-the-incredible-hulk-e-1458197622|publisher=[[Gizmodo]]|title=The 9 Least Incredible Adventures the Incredible Hulk Ever Had|date=November 4, 2013|access-date=November 9, 2019|archive-date=November 3, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181103132431/https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-8-least-incredible-adventures-the-incredible-hulk-e-1458197622|language=en|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=ScreenRant6.6.16>{{cite web|author=Zambrano, Mark|url=https://screenrant.com/biggest-wtf-things-hulk-has-done/|publisher=Screen Rant|title=11 Biggest WTF Things The Hulk Has Ever Done|date=June 6, 2016|access-date=November 9, 2019|archive-date=January 14, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180114184937/https://screenrant.com/biggest-wtf-things-hulk-has-done/|language=en|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Origins===
Umar was born a Faltine, a race of immortal beings made of pure magical energy that reside in their own universe.<ref name=DenOfGeek/><ref name=CBR7.25.19>{{cite web|author=Wyatt, Cat|url=https://www.cbr.com/doctor-strange-greatest-most-powerful-enemies-ever-marvel/|publisher=[[CBR.com]]|title=Doctor Strange: The 10 Worst Enemies Stephen Strange Has Ever Faced, Ranked|date=July 25, 2019|access-date=November 8, 2019|archive-date=July 26, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190726135834/https://www.cbr.com/doctor-strange-greatest-most-powerful-enemies-ever-marvel/|url-status=live}}</ref> Umar is the daughter of Sinifer and the sister of [[Dormammu]],<ref name=CBR7.25.19/> who is usually depicted in a demonic form.<ref name=CinemaBlend1/> When Faltine spawn, they usually take the duplicate form of their parents, but she and her brother Dormammu expressed individual distinctiveness from their parents.<ref name=DenOfGeek/> After they murder one of their fellow Faltines, they are banished from that universe.<ref name=CBR7.25.19/><ref name=SyFy>{{cite web |last1=Century |first1=Sara |title=Clea, the underrated Sorcerer Supreme |url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/clea-the-underrated-sorcerer-supreme |website=[[SyFy Wire]]|access-date=November 8, 2019|language=en |date=December 5, 2018|archive-date=December 6, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181206053435/https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/clea-the-underrated-sorcerer-supreme|url-status=live}}</ref>

They escaped this banishment, and later conquered the Faltine and the Dark Dimension, which they subsequently ruled with iron fists, expanding their power bases while keeping the [[Mindless Ones]] out of that dimension.<ref name=DenOfGeek/> Although the siblings conquer the Dark Dimension together, battling that realm's defenders weakens Umar, who is relegated to the status of Dormammu's subordinate,<ref name=CinemaBlend3/> and is forced to take the form of a mortal body.<ref name=CBR7.25.19/> Umar meets the disciple of Dormammu named Orini, with whom she bears a daughter named [[Clea]],<ref name=CBR7.25.19/><ref name=SyFy/> but Umar immediately becomes disgusted and disdainful of Orini.<ref name=SyFy/> Clea apparently spends most of her childhood essentially parentless, and would not discover that Umar was her mother until she is an adult.<ref name=SyFy/>

Umar grows frustrated with her status in exile,<ref name=SyFy/> and after discovering she can return to her original form, she attacks her brother in rage, but he easily defeats and banishes her<ref name=CinemaBlend3/> to a pocket world within the Dark Dimension.<ref name=SyFy/> When Doctor Strange later defeats Dormammu during a subsequent encounter, Umar is freed from her exile and takes control of the Dark Dimension, but her rule is temporary. She later comes into conflict with Strange and his allies on her own in many storylines.<ref name=CinemaBlend3/>

===The Dark Dimension===
Besides being an unpredictable threat to Doctor Strange, Umar also paves the way for her daughter Clea who becomes a love interest for Strange. Umar has used her daughter as a hostage before to lure Strange into her traps, and conversely, Clea has teamed up with Strange to defeat her mother and knock her off the throne.

In ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #156, Strange is narrowly able to defeat Umar only by summoning Zom, the one entity whose strength rivals her own, though doing this presents a different set of hazards,<ref name=ScreenRant/> that Strange survives only with the intervention of the [[Living Tribunal]].<ref>''[[Strange Tales]]'' #157 (June 1967). Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

===Clea===
One of the Mhuruuks who was not slain was Orini, son of Olnar, being just an untrained boy. In time he aged, while the Faltinians remained the same. Eventually Orini became the chief disciple of Dormammu. In time Umar noticed the adult Orini, and had a tryst with him. Both evidently were virgins, and Umar was initially disgusted with the experience and with Orini himself (she later became a skilled seductor, but her disdain for Orini remained unchanged). In six cycles of the Dark Dimension, Umar gave birth to [[Clea]]. This experience changed Umar, and she now was no longer able to return to her Faltinian form.{{Issue|date=February 2010}}

Her inability to transform angered Umar, and in her frustration she lashed out at Dormammu. Now far stronger than Umar, Dormammu banished her to one of the subjugated pocket dimensions of the Dark Dimension.{{Issue|date=February 2010}}

===Versus Dr. Strange===
In time, Dormammu tried to invade Earth's dimension and came into conflict with first the [[Ancient One]], and then [[Doctor Strange]]. Eventually Dormammu was defeated, and the spell banishing Umar was broken. Umar was able to stop the invasion of the Dark Dimension by the [[Mindless Ones]], and became ruler of the Dark Dimension.<ref>''Strange Tales'' vol. 1 #150. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> Despite having been banished by him, Umar sought to avenge her brother on Strange. She held Clea hostage in the Dark Dimension, to lure Strange back in. When she first fought Strange, she was the more powerful, but then the entity called [[Veritas (comics)|Sayge]] showed Umar an image of Umar's original Faltinian visage.<ref>''Strange Tales'' vol. 1 #151-155. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> This sight drove Umar almost to madness, and she traveled to Earth to destroy it in revenge. There, she battled the Ancient One. Strange defeated her by summoning another monster; Zom, forcing her to flee.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #156. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> Umar later freed Doctor Strange, enabling him to defeat Dormammu.<ref>''[[Dr. Strange]]'' #173. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

Umar attacked Doctor Strange and Clea on Earth, and transported the essence of Dormammu to Earth's core, where he reformed.<ref>''Dr. Strange'' vol. 2 #6. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> With Orini, Umar defeated Doctor Strange on Dormammu's behalf.<ref>''Dr. Strange'' vol. 2 #7.

Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> Umar's seduction of Orini resulting in the birth of Clea was then recounted. Umar stole Dormammu's power, using it to battle Doctor Strange and Clea. Umar was defeated when Gaea caused Dormammu's power to return to him.<ref>''Dr. Strange'' vol. 2 #9. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> Umar later battled [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] in an attempt to disrupt a chess match between [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]] and Dormammu.<ref>''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor Annual]]'' #9. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

Umar later intervened in Doctor Strange's battle with a deranged [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]].<ref>''Dr. Strange'' vol. 2 #68. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> She conjured a sea serpent and water elementals to attack Doctor Strange and the Black Knight on Earth.<ref>''Dr. Strange'' vol. 2 #69. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> Umar's origin was finally recounted,<ref>''Dr. Strange'' vol. 2 #71. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> and the secret of Clea's parentage was finally revealed to Clea and Doctor Strange.<ref>''Dr. Strange'' vol. 2 #72. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> Umar was then deposed as ruler of the Dark Dimension by Clea,<ref>''Dr. Strange'' vol. 2 #73. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> and with Orini, Umar was banished to an alien dimension by Doctor Strange and Clea.<ref>''Dr. Strange'' vol. 2 #74. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

Dormammu returned to overthrow Clea, and freed Umar from banishment. Clea and Doctor Strange escaped Dormammu, but met with Umar, who wanted to kill Doctor Strange. Umar noticed that her spell was also affecting Clea. Clea revealed that they had been married and that there now was a mystical link between them. Umar stopped her attack and admitted to Clea that she was unable to kill her own daughter. She assisted Strange and Clea in overthrowing Dormammu. Umar tricked her brother by suggesting that they divide the rulership over the Dark Dimension into two parts. Dormammu agreed and Umar banished him to his part: the domain of the Mindless Ones. Umar made peace with Strange and Clea and would now rule the Dark Dimension with [[Baron Mordo]] at her side. Clea returned to Earth with Strange.<ref>''Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme'' #22-24. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

Many months later, Clea was approached by another Faltine, who claimed to be her cousin. He informed her that she needed to defeat Umar, who had turn into a dictator. Clea returned, but found out that it was a trick: the other Faltine was Dormammu in disguise and he absorbed Umar and Mordo into his own body, growing gigantic in size and power. Clea remained in the Dark Dimension to battle Dormammu.<ref>''Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme'' #48-50. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

Umar was separated from Dormammu again, although the siblings retained a mystic link, and the two collaborated in defeating an [[Incarnation|avatar]] of [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]], and using the acquired power to remake the universe in their hellish image, but she eventually betrayed her brother, stole his power, and trapped him in the form of a powerless crippled mutate.<ref>''[[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]'' vol.3, #1-5 (2005). Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

When Dormammu's minion, the criminal gang leader known as [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] questions [[Satana (Marvel Comics)|Satana]] to learn about his master, the demoness refers to Umar as having been killed by her brother.<ref>''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign: The Hood]]'' #3 (2009). Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

Umar is later resurrected along with other villains by the magic of the Wishing Well.<ref>''[[Hulk]]s'' #631. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

During the "[[Death of Doctor Strange]]" storyline, Umar manifested part of her kingdom in Antarctica. Clea later mentioned to Classic Doctor Strange and those present that Umar and the other inter-dimensional warlords are fleeing from the Three Mothers.<ref>''Death of Doctor Strange'' #2. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Umar is immortal and possesses superhuman strength. Like Dormammu, Umar's magical powers greatly exceed those of all of Earth's sorcerers, including Dr. Strange, especially when her power is combined with Dormammu. However, the fact that he is threatened by his sister's power precludes frequent alliances between the two.<ref name=ScreenRant/>

==In other media==
Umar in her human form is a featured [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] in the 2012 video game ''[[Marvel: Avengers Alliance]]''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Morse, Ben|url=http://marvel.com/news/video_games/25306/go_inside_avengers_alliance_spec_op_30|title=News: Go Inside Avengers Alliance Spec Op 30|date=October 19, 2015|publisher = [[Marvel Entertainment]]|access-date=November 8, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151021144906/http://marvel.com/news/video_games/25306/go_inside_avengers_alliance_spec_op_30 |archive-date=October 21, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In July 2016, Cat Wyatt ranked Umar #10 on [[CBR.com]]'s list of "The 10 Worst Enemies Stephen Strange Has Ever Faced".<ref name=CBR7.25.19/>

The scene in which Umar uses her magic to seduce the Hulk in ''Defenders'' (Vol 2) #3 (November 2005), only to be dissatisfied with his [[premature ejaculation|inability to copulate]] with her for more six minutes, has been mentioned as among critics as a notable encounter between the two adversaries,<ref name=CBR7.18.17/> with Anthony Avina, citing it for his inclusion of the pair's relationship in [[CBR.com]]'s 2019 list of the 10 Best Romances Between Heroes And Villains among Marvel characters.<ref>{{cite web|author=Avina, Anthony|url=https://www.cbr.com/marvel-romances-heroes-villains/|publisher=CBR.com|title=Marvel: 10 Best Romances Between Heroes And Villains|date=September 11, 2019|access-date=November 9, 2019|archive-date=September 14, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190914021345/https://www.cbr.com/marvel-romances-heroes-villains/|language=en|url-status=live}}</ref> Others, however, criticized the scene.

In August 2016, a reader poll conducted by [[Comics Alliance]] on the most memorable stories featuring the archenemeses of Dr. Strange included the reunion of the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] to confront Umar and Dormammu in the 2005 miniseries ''Defenders: Indefensible''.<ref name=ComicsAlliance8.10.19/>

Umar had been advocated as an addition to the films of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) from before the release of the 2016 ''[[Doctor Strange (2016 film)|Doctor Strange]]'' feature film.<ref name=CinemaBlend3/> The success of that film prompted speculation and suggestions on which villains should have been selected for that film's sequel. That November, [[Den of Geek!]] published a list of characters desired for the [[Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness|second ''Doctor Strange'' film]]. Contributor Marc Buxton included Umar, whom he named as the "nastiest" of Strange's enemies, comparing her to [[Cersei Lannister]] of the ''[[Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novel series. Buxton observed that while Dormammu represents raw power, Umar exhibits "guile and malevolent intelligence" and suggested that making her a film's antagonist would provide for an "epic" story.<ref name=DenOfGeek/> In March 2019, Ben Sherlock, writing for [[CBR.com]], included Umar in that website's list of "9 Powerful Doctor Strange Villains We Hope To See In The MCU". Sherlock argued that the use of Dormammu in the 2016 ''[[Doctor Strange (2016 film)|Dr. Strange]]'' film would make appearances by his sister easy. Sherlock suggested that Strange's defeat of Dormammu at the end of that film would provide a revenge motive for Umar, and might lend itself to a personal and more intimate conflict than the one in the 2016 film.
