  I'm sorry. It's just this new job. It can be such a grind.  Kids these days just don't understand how much their parents break their back to provide.  Goodbye, Linda. So this is where all the main boxing and transferring happens. I'm excited to have you guys working here at the fulfillment center, Mr. and Mrs. Tweek. Yeah, people are ordering everything online these days. That's why you'll find a lot of familiar faces working here.  Everything's automated and timed to precision to get people's orders out to them as soon as possible. This is Josh, he'll be your section manager. In these warehouses, there are over one million items, from toothpaste to Go Karts, and it's the work of both humans and machines that make the work possible.  Josh!  Whenever there's a workplace accident, you need to fill out a 1081 form.   Can I have a beer, please? Whatcha got on tap? Gimme Amazon Light. I'm a Prime member.  Yeah, well, we should be thankful we even have jobs, huh? Before the fulfillment center opened, we really didn't have anything.  Okay, hold on, everyone. I'm sure there's an explanation. Hold on, guys.  M-My son has a big bike parade coming up. I... I can't just not show up to work now. A bike parade.  There's no easy way to say this, so I'll... just come out with is then. We're... not Amazon Prime members anymore.  Everyone involved in the strike has been dropped down one level from Prime. We're... we're now Amazon USDA Choice.  Please... I don't know what else to do. My family is all that matters to me.  What if they just get others to do all the boxing for us?  My family has to come first.  Don't you understand? It's not about me! It's my son! He's just a kid! He wants to be in the bike parade!
