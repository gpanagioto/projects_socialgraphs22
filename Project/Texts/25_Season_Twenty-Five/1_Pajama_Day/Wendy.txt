Mr. Principal sir, can we please wear our pajamas on pajama day? Mr. Principal, we really didn't do anything wrong.  Oh, fuck! Yes? Sir? Well, Mr. principal, if you justâ€“ We all have to be on the same page here. We apologize.  You guys want a chance to save pajama day? Then join us in telling Mr. Garrison we're all sorry. At school tomorrow, we all tell Mr. Garrison he was right and that we've been terrible students. That we weren't listening and that he deserves to be angry with us. We tell him how much we care and that we want to see him more as a human being than just a teacher. We just have to be brave. Remember... no matter how angry he is, tell him he's right.  "This is..."  You wanted to see me, sir? Sir, maybe people won't lose respect for you if you change your mind. Saying you were wrong is sometimes the strongest thing you can do. Then we can't put on our pajamas. Out of principle. The kids will be okay. At least we still have opposite day to look forward to. I said we'll be okay. It's always the second Friday in March.
