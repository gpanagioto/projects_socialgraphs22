Yeah, what we need is something to raise awareness. Something like... a documentary. You know, follow Cartman around, with a video camera, and then get all his bullshit on television.  At least then we'd be voicing our concern. I mean, if you think about it, we should feel some shame for... complaining about it and not doing anything. Hey, tell you what: if you wanna follow Cartman around, and get a video of him, I'll pay to make it into a documentary, and get it on the air. He doesn't need to know the truth. Kyle will get what he wants, and so will I.   Come in. I helped you make a documentary, Kyle. Kyle, Kyle, I'm trying to make compelling television.  If they can feel okay about that, why can't I? But she's not black, Kyle. She's white.  Not by us, or anyone else.  It actually aired last night. Yeah, but don't worry. It didn't do so good. We got killed in the ratings by Honey Boo Boo. Well it was only our first show of the season, so you really can't- That's good, Fatty, get pissed! Yeah, Fatty! What the hell is going on?
