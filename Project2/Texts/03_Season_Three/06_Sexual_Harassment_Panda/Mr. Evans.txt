Uh uh, have a seat, Mr. Morris. Uh... S-Sexual Harassment Panda. Uhâ€”M-m-m-Mr. Morris, we at the school board have been thinking, and, we've decided that perhaps a "panda" isn't the best way to explain sexual harassment to children.  ...I'm afraid we're just going to have to let you go. That's thirty-two more lawsuits in the past twenty-four hours. Looks like we'll have to cut all counseling and nutrition programs. Holy smokes, you're right! Ugh!  P-please! Don't sue us. Oh! Well, uh... We had to let him go.  D'uh. I mean, he left.
