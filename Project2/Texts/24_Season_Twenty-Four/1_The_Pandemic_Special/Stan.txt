I'm, I'm here. It's not school! It's a freakin' joke. We're not even learning anything. No, I'm fine, Mom! You know, I'm strong. I'm just worried about how this is all affecting weaker kids like, you know, like Butters. Yeah, Uncle Jimbo. Wow, that's great! If they're letting us go back to school, then soon we can get back to everything! I mean, doesn't this mean things are finally going back to normal? Dad? Oh cool! Turn it up! They think they're about to find the vaccine. What's a pangolin, Mom? Do you know what a pangolin is, Dad? Uh, we were there, and Token was actually taken to the hospital because you guys shot him. That doesn't make any sense!  Butters, Butters, you gotta calm down. Kyle, I need to talk to you. I'm really worried. About Butters. I think he's sick. No! It's all the other stuff. The isolation and the uncertainty.  I'm just really worried what all the stuff around COVID is doing to some kids. You know, not every kid is like us. There's some kids who really can't take it anymore.  And what if he's not? What if Butters is actually starting to lose his mind? What if he feels his body shutting down right now? It's time for us to ask for help. From someone who has more authority at this school than these cops. Uh, hi, it's Stan Marsh. I'm sorry. We had to get your attention. Listen, we're being kept at the school, and one of the students here is really sick. Nono, Mr. President, please! You gotta come back to South Park. Our teachers are shooting people. Everyone's arguing and, and there's a facility outside of town that found the pangolin and are working on a vaccine! You might be able to stop the pandemic. ...Huh? But the pandemic isn't just killing Mexicans. You're just gonna sit there and not do anything?! God dammit! Butters. Butters! Don't worry. I'm going to save you! Guys, guys!  Shhh. You guys, we have to get Butters out of here. No! We have to get him out of here! Now! We need to take him... to Build-A-Bear. He has to go out and do something normal! We can't wait around and wait for people to figure things out, okay?! It's not gonna happen! They just keep taking everything from him and saying it's for his own good! But who's to say he can't go out and have a little goddamn fun?! If we want things to go back to normal, then we just gotta go do it! They're just gonna be making more restrictions, and more rules, and who's gonna fight to go back to the way things were? We can make things normal for Butters again, and make school the way it was! Wait, what? No, in a class, with real teachers! I'm talking about normal, like back in March. What normal are you talking about? Look it doesn't matter. We just gotta break the fuck out of here. Okay, all clear! Come on! Go go go!  All right, you ready to have some fun, Butters? Shit shit, get back, back, back, back, back!  Butters, Butters.  Yeah, it's real. Come on! We got an appointment!  Oh, uh hey, excuse me. We had an appointment. But I called. Y-you said you were open today for appointments. Ple-hease, my friend has to build a bear. Ohoh, just give us one minute! We can't go. We don't have a choice. We're gonna have to break in. And then build him a bear. If we have to, yes! I don't care! I'm not following the rules anymore! Here we are, Butters! Look! You made it! No, it's not a dream! We are really here, and we are going to build you a bear! Which one you want? You want the panda? You want the Bronco koala? Caballero Grizzly.  Okay, we just find the sh-shell and the uh, the outfit. It's gonna fucking work! Just fucking shut up!  We're gonna put the stuffing in! Okay, uh, um...  It's okay! We can start over! We can start over! There'a do-over machine right over there! Look!  God dammit!  No, Kyle, we can't let Butters down! No! I'm not giving up! Cartman, no!  Don't do it, Cartman! That thing is our only chance! You guys were right, okay? This hasn't been about Butters. I've been acting like this because I can't take these shutdowns anymore, and I'm scared what it's doing to me! I'm looking for whom to blame. Saying I'm trying to help people to make myself feel better because the truth is... I just wanna have fun again.
