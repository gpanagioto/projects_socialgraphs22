 What? That's not for boys to look at! It's a secret girl list and YOU can't see it! I'm not...  Today's list meeting is called to order. Rebecca, you have the floor. Rebecca moves we work on List 47D. Does that sparkle with all the girls? The committee has already decided that nothing with stripes can be in the Top 5 cutest purses. All right, all right, come before the Rainbow Railing.  Let me assure you that no list is made hastily by this committee! I cannot by Sparkle Law move to have an old list investigated. However, if you can find recourse for such an inquiry, Wendy, I would review it. Does that sparkle with all the girls? Kyle was simple a casualty! To move Clyde meant that Craig has to be moved to number twelve, which moved Jimmy down and moved Jason up! Did you see these shoes, Wendy?!  They're incredible! Right? No, it's a little strap. If you hadn't gone all Nancy Drew on us, this would have just gone away!  Oh please, you're lying.  Wait, I, I didn't do anything wrong.
