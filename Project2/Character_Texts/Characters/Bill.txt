I was held back ten human grades.  I mean, grades. Do you companion-friends know Eric Cartman? Eric Cartman? And you have a ''Dawson's Creek'' Trapper Keeper Futura S 2000? Yes. Yes, I do.  May I hold your Trapper Keeper? Ahhh, hello Eric. Can I be your human friend?  I mean, friend? Please. We can have ''fun'' and play games, like human four square--  I mean, four square.   Wagh! '''''Gaagghhh!'''''  Please. You do not understand.  That Trapper Keeper has to be destroyed! Nooo! Listen to me! I am not really Bill Cosby.  My name is BSM-471. I am a cyborg engineered by humans from the year 2034.

He goes against the Church. He must die! You are soft! Weak! You leave me no choice: take them!  You are no longer able to fulfill your duties to the Lord!  Every Hare Club member, young and old, will watch as their precious savior dies! Lock up those two Jews!  We'll deal with them later. My people! This Easter I'm gonna start by making our rabbit stew ten times meatier!  Behold, no longer will Easter be about bunnies and colored eggs! Kill the rabbit!  Why won't you go away?! Enough of this blasphemy! I'm the Pope now! That means I am the voice of God!
