Scuzzlebutt is a creature that lives up on this very mountain, and kills anybody who dares climb to the top. Because, it loves the taste of blood, and likes to add pieces to its deformed body. Well, on his left arm, instead of a hand, he has... No! A piece of celery. Yeah, and he walks with a limp. Because one of his legs is missing. And where his leg should be, there's nothing but...Patrick Duffy. What do you mean? Have you ever seen Step By Step?  So he lives alone on this mountain, and weaves baskets, and other assorted crafts. They say that on quiet nights you can hear him weaving his baskets. Tashink ...tashink ...tashink. Hey, it might be! Screw you guys! ...Go to Hell! They don't think Scuzzlebutt is scary huh? Let's see how they like it when they actually ''see'' Scuzzlebutt! I'll scare the hell out of 'em tomorrow!
