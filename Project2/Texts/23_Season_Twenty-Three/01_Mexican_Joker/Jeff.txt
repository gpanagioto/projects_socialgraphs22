Good day, children. My name is Jeff. We know you've been separated from your families. But we want you to get a little excited about the fun we have in store for you. Everyone, please take your own piece of aluminum foil. What?! How did a Jew get in here? Oh boy, we've gotta get this kid out of here.  People might think we're racist. Sorry for our little mistake. We're goin' to get you on your way home as soon as we can. Hey. When it's raining, you gotta roll up the windows. We understand these things are hard for your people. What do you mean? Yes. Correct. Which one of them do you think is Mexican Joker? Hey David, can I talk to you alone, please. Excuse us, kid.  Now then, the most important thing is that we've got to keep this quiet! We can't let Mexican Joker know that we're onto him. Now, listen: that's just what he wants us to do. Im saying, what if he's on Mexican Joker's side?  Kids, let's all say hi to Princess Star! Oh no! Everyone boo Mexican Joker, kids! Boooo! Boo! That's enough, Mexican Joker! Your rage and your anger have made you a bad person in the eyes of Christ. I know your life was hard as a kid, but everyone has hard times.   Another busload? Oh, criminy! Welcome, children. My name is Jeff. Hey. Hey! What the hell are you guys doin'?! Are you guys completely stupid?! We can't perform shock therapy on every child that comes in here! Think of the budgetary restraints! What if this IS the flashback?! We might be IN the flashback, Dave! Maybe you're shocking the child that grows up to be Mexican Joker!  We can't fight this guy alone, Dave. It's time to alert the military. Oh shit, it's the flashback! It's the flashback! Come on! Something must be happening with the kids!  Oh Christ, look! He's converting them all to Judaism! Oh Jesus, they're all Jews with their little aluminum foil yarmulkes! Hey, that's right. It is.   Nobody here is Mexican Joker? Oh, then I'm in the wrong flashback.
