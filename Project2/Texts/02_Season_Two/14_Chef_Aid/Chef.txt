Hello there, children. What did you say? Eric, where did you hear that song?  Well, I'll be sodomized on Christmas. Children, I wrote that song 20 years ago. Yeah. Back when I used to be in the rock business. And now it looks like some big record company has published one of my songs. Aww, I don't want any money. I just like to see my name on the credits, that's all. Well, all right. Maybe I will go. I’ll play them my version of the song. So you see, Mr. Big record producer, "Stinky Britches" was something I wrote several years ago. Huh? Now, look, I’m trying to be cool about this, but you just can't rip people's music off! It's against the law! Sue ''me''?! You stole one of my songs, and you’re gonna sue me? Right. Why "uh-oh"? Uh-oh. What? Whoops?! Do I look like I have two million? This can't be happening..! Hey, that's my favorite chair! Hey, children. Children, that record company guy is takin' all my belongings. And if I don't come up with two million, I'm going to jail. Okay, okay, children, thank you very much. I feel much better. Sure. Just please stop. This? This is my photo album of all my times in the rock business. Did I? Janis Joplin, The Beatles, Elton John... I got to travel all around the world, hanging out with bands, going to lavish parties, lovin' many, many women. Nothing. Anyway-- Hey! That has no monetary value! What the hell are you taking that for?! But I have 24 hours to come up with your money! That's the law! That does it. You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna raise that two million, but I'm not going to use it to pay you back. I'm going to use it to hire Johnnie Cochran myself and sue you! Watch me. Now get the <b>fudge</b> out of my house! Okay. Thank you, Mr. Cochran.  Well, Johnnie Cochran will take my case if I can pay his legal fee, $2 million. Oh, they wouldn't remember me. All I did was cook for them. I appreciate that, children, but raising $2 million is not an easy thing to do. My only hope is to whore myself to every woman in town. Wish me luck, children. No problem, Ms. Broflovski. Uhh, now, about that hundred bucks? I have a loooooong way to go to raise the kind of money I need. Uh-uh, hold on a second, Veronica Crabtree. How would you like to use some... sex toys? Like this very special device. I call it "Chef’s pleasure bag". Now, all you do is put this paper bag over your head, and it increases your sexual pleasure. Ahh, yeah. That's much better.  I can't keep doing this. It's killing me. I'm serious! I'm not gonna make it. It's over, children. I couldn't raise the $2 million to hire Johnnie Cochran. Now I have to go to jail. Huh? Did what?! Wow! How much did you make?  Oh. I made about $410,300, but-- Goodbye, children. Thanks for all your help. Ow! What the hell did you do that for?! Ow! Ow! You finally snapped, huh, Garrison? Don't you get it, Garrison? It's all you! You're Mr. Hat and Mr. Twig! You've got split personality schizophrenic jeebies. What?! No, Garrison! Shut the hell up! What the? How the hell did he reach the gas pedal? What the hell is this? Mr. Hat busted me out. Children, did you do this? I don’t believe it! You will? It feels great! I just can't find the words to thank all the artists who put on Chef Aid. And most of all, I want to thank the children. Get back to what's important. It's Tuesday. And means tomorrow is tuna casserole day.
