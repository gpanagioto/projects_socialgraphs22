Shoot me. I wish I were dead I'm ''not'' being silly! Kill me. I'd do it myself, but I'm too damn old. Uhhhhh Ah, dammit! Dammit Billy, do you want a dollar or don't ya? Ok. You just have to do one thing for me. Why not? I killed my grandpa when I was your age. What has America's youth come to? Kids won't even kill their own grandparents. Ingrate! You pompous son of a whore! Uhhhh. Billy, help grandpa stick this fork in the outlet. Kill me, God dammit! Well then, have one of your little friends do it. You can kill me can't ya? Ohh, is that a fact? Well, let me tell you something, Porky. Your mom was over here earlier, and I humped her like a little bitch. That's right. And then, I dug up your great-grandma's skeleton, and had my way with her too. Choice piece of ass, your great-grandma. That's the spirit, Tubby. I ever tell you about the time I boofed your dad, Fatso? Billy, would you mind holding this for grandpa, please? Tug - a - little harder, Billy. Uh, ow. Dammit! I was so close. Come here Billy, I want to show you something. Yes you do, you little pecker! I realized that the reason you won't kill me... ...is because you don't understand how I feel, Billy, but now I found a way to show you what it feels like to be a grandpa. Now, you're about to see what it's like to be as old as me. Are you ready, Billy? Not just yet. That's it, now you know what it feels like to be grandpa. So now will you kill me, Billy? That's good Billy, a little higher now. Does the pope crap in the woods? Uhh, cut the damn rope already! It's about time you lazy-ass son of a whore. Come on, let's go. What the...? Come back here, you pompousy son of a pansy! Come over here, you son of a whore! Hey, you were supposed to kill me! That's not fair, Goddammit! My grandpa asked me to kill him and I did it. Grandpa? My name's not Billy, grandpa. And what's wrong with you? Why do you look all haggard? Limbo? But I've been waiting for 25 years. I'm planning a trip to Africa. Did you know that over 400 people are eaten naturally by lions in Africa every year? 
No, Billy. We're gonna watch the Bob Saget show. Ten thousand dollars? Holy smokes. I won! I won! 
Look at how big you've gotten! Well, this is what the holidays are about. Family. Well, what does your family do for the holidays, Stan?  No, Jimmy, this is my pot pie!  No, Jimmy! That's a bad Jimmy! Yes. Now, watch that ass in prison, son. 
Okay, you all know the rules. You must fire your blanks into the air, and if someone says they killed ya, you gotta play dead.  What the hell? The Confederacy doesn't take the bell! God dammit! Now we have to start over! Alright, folks. Sorry for the false start. We're ready to go again. It was a cold morning in 1862. The Union Army had to-  God dammit, what the hell are they doing?! God dammit! Well, come on Billy, we've gotta make these little peckers stop before they get themselves killed. They're not terrorists, they're just a bunch of drunk wankers from Colorado. You bastards! Nice thinkin', Billy. Dammit, Billy, this isn't about you havin' to be slaves! This is about history! We can't let them change it! Wait a minute! They're all still doing a reenactment. What we have to do is play into that. Come on, Billy. You boys need a quick history lesson!  
 Why the hell do you wanna take these boys to see that fufu French theater crap? You're gonna turn them into poofders! Well, he doesn't need to see a bunch of frogs prance around in tights and make-up wrappin' their peckers around each other's faces!  Close your eyes and cover your ears, Billy! Remember, you're a man. Aha, I knew it. They turned you into poofders. No, Billy! You're gonna stay here and watch more MacGyver. We've gotta get all the Frenchy-poo fag-nasties out of ya.  Who the hell would be ringin' the doorbell at this time of night? That Grandma is not a bad piece of ass. Well, it's good for 'im.  Got everything you need there, do ya? They're quite agile little things, aren't they? Y'don't say.  Youâ€¦ ...remember any of that stuff, do ya?  Ah.  Oh-oooh-oooh!  You're damn right she's tired. Oh, nothin'. She's just gonna have a little trouble walkin' today is all. .  Well, all tuckered, is she? Ha ha ha ha. A little cottony in the crotch? Hr hr hr hr. What?!  Oh, dear Jesus! No wonder she didn't say good-night.  Aw, go ahead and shoot me! I dare ya! Pull the trigger, you little pussy! 
I wanna die.
