Don't be sad, Ike. Just be happy that you live in a country where people get to elect a president at all.  Hello? Nothing, watching the election results. What?! Alright, what is this all about, fatass?! It doesn't matter if I am or not. People voted and I stand behind the president. Sure you do! Chr, what could you possibly have in your room that could change the outcome of the election?  What the hell is this? I don't believe it. Why do you have these? Dude! Knock it off, Cartman! You're not getting away with this, you fat turd!  This isn't a joke, Cartman! You have to believe me, officer. The outcome of the election depends on it. Upstairs! First door to the left! But... they were here. Ah I swear it. Stacks and stacks of ballots from states all over the country! Please you've, you've got to believe me! They've still gotta be here somewhere! Uh we've got to find them! Guys! You guys!  Listen: Cartman has tens of thousands of voter ballots hidden somewhere. He's changed the outcome of the election! Come on guys! He's hidden them somewhere and we have to find them! Dude, because of the electoral college these votes in swing states can really matter. God damn it this is serious, you guys! Cartman has stolen the election!  Butters, you know something, don't you?!  What did Cartman tell you?! Tell us what you know right now! Then you have to tell us! Oh shit! Don't let him swallow it!  Butters, where are the ballots going?! Where are they going?! Can we please just try and talk to him? Butters, you have to tell us what Cartman is up to! I didn't wanna have to do this.  but if you don't tell us, I'm gonna tell your dad you helped get the wrong person elected President! Then just tell me what Cartman is up to! What?  Butters, where's Cartman supposed to hand over the ballots?!  Where? What? All right, where are the missing ballots?!  President Obama? Wait a minute, the rights to ''Star Wars'', the movies? What the hell is going on here?! Anything in the basement, Jimmy? Well keep looking. Sorry Ms. Cartman, but your son took some things that didn't belong to him.  We need everyone's help here. What you're looking for are big boxes of ballots. Hundreds of them. Please check your basement, your attic, and- Yeah, probably 'cause General Tso's chicken.  What?  It just seems so unfair. People won't ever even know that the wrong man is in the White House. It matters, Stan. It it matters.  Oh my God. Look! There they are! We found it, you guys!  No! These don't belong to you! They belong to the people! Protect it? Well... if you put it that way...
