Nothing, I mu-I mean, nowhere. No! She's just pissed off 'cause she got headgear at the dentist. She's taking it out on me. My parents don't even believe that she beats me up. They think she's all innocent and sweet, but I know that she's an evil bitch! Hey Kyle, what's that elephant doing? Yeah. Whoa dude! Where'd you get a pet elephant? Wow, that's cool! Well yeah, but pigs aren't smart, like elephants. That'd be cool! Wait, wait. We still need a pig. Okay.  Yes... Oh, neither. It's my sister. Hi Shelly. Headgear? What headgear? Oh, uh gosh uh, I didn't really notice. No, I think it looks terrific. It matches your AAAAAH! Go where? Yeah, quit being such a baby. At least I'm not a little pig-fucker! Do you have anything besides just animals with four asses? Ow! Yeah, what kind of name is Pip anyway?! Yeah! Go away, Pip! I don't think an elephant would make love to a pig. So how do we do that? Hey uh, you guys want to come over to my house? Really, you, you guys don't want to come over for just a little bit? Shut up Cartman! Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?! Sick dude, she's my sister. Crap. No, I mean, yes, I mean, what neck-brace? Shelly, before you beat my face into a bloody pulp again, I just want you to know that... that you're my sister, and I love you. No. Ahh! Someday, Shelly, I'm gonna be bigger than you, and you're gonna wish you'd never done any of this to me. Damn, I wonder how drunk he needs to be to make sweet love to the pig. Sick! Yeah, when does Mother Nature go from beautiful to ugly? Uh, we saw an elephant have sex with a pig. A big mutant version of me? I bet he weighs four hundred pounds. Oh my God! Officer Barbrady, my evil genetic clone is destroying the town. We have to find him. It wasn't me Uncle Jimbo, it was my evil genetic clone. Stop! That's good, that's good dude. Just calm down. Stan, how would you like to go home and meet your sister? ...So remember, Shelly's the one with the big wire coming out of her mouth and a metal plate on her back. When you see Shelly, kick her ass. Shelly bad, Shelly very bad. No! Shelly bad, you good. He's tearing up the house, stop him! Come on Kyle, Cartman. Mom and dad are home. My house is a disaster, you guy- you guys have got to help me. You can't just leave me here alone. ''Thanks a lot.'' It isn't fair! Everybody hates me! The whole town wants me killed! Mom and dad are gonna send me away! I don't want to be sent away! I want to stay here! Eehhhehehe! Shelly, you, you saved my life. And yet, you've done so much more than that. Today you've taught me the meaning of family. Sure, families don't always get along, but when the forces of evil descend upon us, we conquer them, by sticking together. Uh, ahh, oooh. Wait, wait, the pig just gave birth. It, it had a baby!
