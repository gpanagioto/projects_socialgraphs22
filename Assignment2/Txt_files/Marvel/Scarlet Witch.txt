'''Scarlet Witch''' ('''Wanda Maximoff''') is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character was created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Jack Kirby]]. Her first appearance was in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|The X-Men]]'' #4 (March 1964) in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]]. Originally said to have the ability to alter probability, the Scarlet Witch has been depicted as a powerful sorceress since the 1980s and on occasion has become powerful enough to alter reality by tapping into greater energy sources. Since her debut, the Scarlet Witch has been labelled as one of Marvel's most notable female heroes and one of the most powerful characters from the [[Marvel Universe]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Olivieri |first=Joshua |date=2018-04-22 |title=A Witch Called Wanda: The 15 Most Reckless Things Scarlet Witch Has Ever Done |url=https://www.cbr.com/scarlet-witch-powerful-things/ |access-date=2022-08-08 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |author1=George Marston |date=2021-09-24 |title=The Scarlet Witch is one of the most influential characters in Marvel Comics history |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/scarlet-witch-marvel-universe-wanda/ |access-date=2022-08-08 |website=gamesradar |language=en}}</ref>

The Scarlet Witch is first depicted as a reluctant [[supervillain]] along with her twin brother, [[Quicksilver (Marvel Comics)|Pietro Maximoff/Quicksilver]], both founding members of the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]]. A year after her debut, she joined the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] superhero team and ever since has often been depicted as a regular member of that or related teams (such as the [[West Coast Avengers]] and [[Force Works]]). In 1975, she married her android teammate [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]], later using borrowed magical forces to make herself pregnant, resulting in twin sons William ("Billy") and Thomas (“Tommy”). Stories in 1989 wiped Tommy and Billy from existence (they would later reappear as the heroes called [[Wiccan (character)|Wiccan]] and [[Speed (Marvel Comics)|Speed]]) and removed Vision's emotions, leading to the annulment of his and Wanda's marriage.

For most of her comic book history, the Scarlet Witch is portrayed as a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], a member of a fictional subspecies of humans born with an "X-gene" that grants [[Superpower (ability)|superhuman abilities]] and traits, although multiple stories also said the nature of her mutant powers were influenced by the [[High Evolutionary]] experimenting on her when she was a child. A 2015 storyline revised Wanda's origin, establishing that her superhuman traits are entirely a result of experimentation done by the [[High Evolutionary]] and on inherited magic abilities. Like [[Franklin Richards (character)|Franklin Richards]] and other characters, her genetics were such that standard X-gene tests gave a false positive, meaning she was never actually born a mutant.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Parrish |first=Robin |date=May 7, 2015 |title=Marvel Comics Retcon Alert: Scarlet Witch And Quicksilver Aren't Mutants Anymore |url=https://www.techtimes.com/articles/51467/20150507/marvel-comics-retcon-scarlet-witch-quicksilver-arent-mutants-anymore.htm |access-date=March 29, 2015 |website=Tech Times |language=en}}</ref>

The character's in-universe backstory and parentage have changed more than once. During the 1960s, she and Quicksilver are said to be the mutant twin offspring of two unnamed parents. Later, it is said the children were given to the geneticist called the [[High Evolutionary]], leaving their true parentage a mystery. In 1974, it is said their parents are Golden Age heroes [[Whizzer (Robert Frank)|Bob Frank / Whizzer]] and [[Miss America (Madeline Joyce)|Madeline Joyce Frank / Miss America]]. Wanda then refers to herself as '''Wanda Frank''' for a time. In 1979, they are revealed to have been raised by human [[Romani people|Romani]] parents, Django and Marya Maximoff. In 1982, [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] concludes he is Wanda and Pietro's father. In 2014, the [[AXIS (comics)|''AXIS'']] crossover revealed Pietro and Wanda are not related to Magneto. In 2015, the twins discover they are not mutants and their superhuman traits are the result of the High Evolutionary's experiments. The 2015–2017 ''Scarlet Witch'' series reveals Wanda and Pietro's adopted parents Django and Marya Maximoff are biologically their aunt and uncle. Their real mother is confirmed to be Natalya Maximoff, the previous Scarlet Witch, a sorceress whose father was the Scarlet Warlock.

Since 2014, [[Elizabeth Olsen]] has portrayed [[Wanda Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wanda Maximoff]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]].

==Publication history==

The Scarlet Witch and her twin brother Quicksilver debuted as a part of the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] in ''X-Men'' #4 (March 1964). They were depicted as reluctant villains, only wanting safety from persecution and uninterested in team leader Magneto's plans for global domination. The Scarlet Witch is depicted as calm and submissive, like many female comic book characters of the time.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.vox.com/2015/4/28/8498521/avengers-age-of-ultron-scarlet-witch-explained|title= The tragic history of Scarlet Witch, who will make her film debut in ''Avengers: Age of Ultron''|last= Abad-Santos|first= Alex|date= April 28, 2015|website= [[Vox (website)|Vox]]|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160701020725/http://www.vox.com/2015/4/28/8498521/avengers-age-of-ultron-scarlet-witch-explained|archive-date= July 1, 2016|url-status=live|access-date=April 27, 2016}}</ref> Her costume was composed of a bathing suit with straps, [[opera glove]]s, short boots, a leotard covering her body, a superhero cape, and a [[wimple]], all of which were colored in shades of red. She was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].<ref name=":0" />

Lee and Kirby also produced the ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' comic book, composed of Marvel's most prominent solo heroes at the time. Save for [[Captain America]], Lee and Kirby eventually had all the Avengers leave to focus on their individual careers, replacing them with former villains from other comics who did not have a series of their own: the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver from ''X-Men'', and [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]] from [[Iron Man]]'s adventures in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]''. The team was known as "Cap's Kooky Quartet."<ref>DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 108: "[Stan Lee] replaced Thor, Iron Man, Giant-Man, and Wasp with Hawkeye, Quicksilver, and Scarlet Witch."</ref> Although common in later years, such a wide-scale change in the roster of a superhero group was completely unprecedented (usually, superhero teams only exchanged one or two members at a time rather than almost the entire roster at once).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://comicbook.com/2015/03/29/all-different-avengers-10-most-questionable-roster-moves/|title= All-Different Avengers: 10 Most Questionable Roster Moves|author= Mark Ginocchio|date= March 31, 2015|publisher= Comic Book|access-date=May 18, 2017}}</ref> Lee and the following ''Avengers'' writer, [[Roy Thomas]], hinted that other Avengers were romantically interested in the Scarlet Witch. The twins later leave the team after a crossover with the X-Men.

Some years later, Thomas brought Wanda and Pietro back into the team and started a long-running romantic relationship between the Scarlet Witch and the android hero [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]], thinking it would help with the series' character development. He elected those characters because they were only published in the ''Avengers'' comic book and did not star in solo adventures, so relationship drama in the series would not interfere with stories in other publications.<ref name="back45">{{cite journal|last= Walker|first= Karen|date= December 2010|title= Shattered Dreams: Vision and the Scarlet Witch|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= #45|pages= 59–65|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|location= Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref> Their first kiss took place during the ''[[Kree–Skrull War]]'' arc.

In ''Giant-Size Avengers'' #1 (August 1974), Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch are revealed to be the children of [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] superheroes [[Whizzer (Robert Frank)]] and [[Miss America (Madeline Joyce)]].

[[Steve Englehart]] succeeded Thomas as the writer of ''Avengers''. He gave Wanda a more assertive personality and removed the highly-protective Quicksilver from the team. In 1974, Englehart expanded Wanda's powers by having her learn witchcraft from [[Agatha Harkness]].<ref name=":1">''The Avengers'' #128 (published by Marvel Comics, 1974).</ref> The Vision and the Scarlet Witch married in ''Giant-Size Avengers'' #4 (June 1975), the end of the Celestial Madonna story arc.

[[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] later replaced Englehart on the series (which was renamed ''Avengers West Coast''). He wrote and illustrated the controversial "Vision Quest" storyline, where the Vision is dismantled and turned into an emotionless being who later even refuses the chance to regain his emotions (leading to the annulment of his marriage to the Scarlet Witch). After this, Byrne retconned William and Thomas to be magical constructs created by Wanda experiencing a "hysterical" pregnancy and then subconsciously using her magic to create the children. At most, Wanda's magic should have only created illusions, but the twins were seemingly given life because Wanda unknowingly empowered them with pieces of the essence of the demon lord [[Mephisto (Marvel Comics)|Mephisto]]. Mephisto later absorbs the children into himself, creating a bond to Wanda's magic and soul. To sever the connection, Agatha Harkness removes Wanda's memory of the children.<ref name=":3">''Avengers West Coast'' #51-52 (Marvel Comics, 1989).</ref> Around this same time, Wanda is brainwashed twice by different villains, first to become a servant for the parasitic life form That Which Endures<ref name=":4">''Avengers West Coast'' #49 (Marvel Comics, 1989).</ref> and then to be a "Bride of Set" during the crossover ''[[Atlantis Attacks]]''. Although her mind is restored both times, the repeated trauma renders her catatonic. At this time, the Vision decides he can't help Wanda or the Avengers West Coast and returns to the NYC team.

Byrne's next storyline involved Wanda becoming a villain yet again, now displaying greater and more focused power than before, and rejoining Magneto.<ref name=":5">''Avengers West Coast'' #56-57 (Marvel Comics, 1990).</ref> Writers Roy and Dann Thomas took over ''Avengers West Coast'', and reveal Wanda's new personality, attacks on the Avengers, and increase in power were all due to manipulations by the time villain [[Immortus]], who had been seen watching the Avengers during some of Byrne's issues. The storyline revealed Wanda is a "nexus being", a person who greatly affects timelines. By influencing Wanda to tap into her nexus energies, Immortus caused her increase in power and the creation of the children. Immortus wishes to use her to warp reality, but Wanda comes to her senses and gives up her nexus energies. Roy and Dann Thomas then revealed that a side effect of this caused Wanda to remember her children and temporarily lose her powers. The website ''[[Women in Refrigerators]]'' interviewed Englehart about these changes, who said he did not like them.<ref name="Steve Englehart">{{cite web |url= http://lby3.com/wir/c-sengl.html|title= STEVE ENGLEHART responds|author= Steve Englehart|publisher= Women in refrigerators|access-date=May 18, 2017}}</ref>

Multiple stories after the Immortus storyline featured Wanda remembering and mourning her children, and even judging teammate [[Julia Carpenter|Spider-Woman]] for bringing her child along on an Avengers assignment.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #60-62 (Marvel Comics, 1990).</ref><ref name=":6">Wanda confirms she remembers and mourns her children in ''Avengers West Coast'' #72 (1991), ''Avengers West Coast'' #84 (1992), ''Avengers West Coast'' Annual #7 (1992), and ''Avengers'' (vol. 3) #2 (1998). In ''Avengers West Coast'' Annual #7, she explains Agatha's spell only blocked her memories of the children for a short time and that since then she has learned to cope with the loss.</ref> Roy Thomas later wrote the short story "A Study in Scarlet", with art by Al Bigley and Mike DeCarlo, published in ''Avengers West Coast'' Annual #7 (1992). The short story featured Wanda reflecting on how she was glad Agatha's memory-blocking spell only lasted a short time, as she appreciates having had the chance to mourn her children properly. She then accidentally creates a window into another timeline where she sees a version of events where she, Vision, and the children remained together. This brings her comfort and helps her feel she can cope with the loss better.<ref name=":12">"A Study in Scarlet" - ''Avengers West Coast'' Annual #7 (Marvel Comics, 1992).</ref>

Following the Immortus storyline, Wanda is a more serious-minded character, wishing to atone for turning against the Avengers twice in a short amount of time and endangering reality. When she regains her powers, her hexes are initially more difficult to control and only on the power level she had when she first joined the Avengers. To compensate, she practices the magic Harkness taught her.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #67 (Marvel Comics, 1991).</ref> In 1994, ''Avengers West Coast'' ended, and several of its team members reformed as an independent group led by Wanda in the series ''[[Force Works]]''. The new title ran for only a couple of years. In 1994, a ''Scarlet Witch'' four-issue limited series was written by [[Andy Lanning]] and [[Dan Abnett]], and pencilled by [[John Higgins (comics)|John Higgins]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://marvel.com/comics/issue/54974/scarlet_witch_1994_1|title= Scarlet Witch (1994) #1|publisher= Marvel Comics|access-date=May 31, 2017}}</ref>

Marvel Comics was nearing bankruptcy in 1996. ''The Avengers'' and other titles were relaunched in a new continuity and line of books called ''[[Heroes Reborn (1996 comic)|Heroes Reborn]]'', outsourced to the studios of [[Image Comics]] artists. [[Rob Liefeld]] worked with the relaunched ''Avengers'' title and included the Scarlet Witch in the team, making her a sorceress with no mutant abilities (the ''Heroes Reborn'' reality did not make any reference to any people born with mutant powers). After Marvel renegotiated the terms of the deal, Liefeld was replaced with writer [[Walter Simonson]] and penciler [[Michael Ryan (artist)|Michael Ryan]]. The project was a success, boosting the sales of the titles and bringing Marvel Comics out of bankruptcy.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.whiterocketbooks.com/avengers/heroesreborn/heroesreborn.html|title= Avengers: Heroes Reborn|author= Adrian Watts|publisher= White Rocket Entertainment|access-date= June 16, 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170626093707/http://www.whiterocketbooks.com/avengers/heroesreborn/heroesreborn.html|archive-date= June 26, 2017}}</ref> The project ended after a year, and the Avengers were returned to the mainstream Marvel reality. The ''Avengers'' series relaunched again, now under [[Kurt Busiek]] and [[George Pérez]]. Pérez designed a new, complicated design for Wanda, increasing the volume of curls in her hair and giving her a costume with Romani influences. Pérez commented he preferred this more challenging design but accepted other artists would find it irksome.<ref name="Nolen-Weathington2003">{{cite book|author=Eric Nolen-Weathington|title=Modern Masters Volume 2: George Perez|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bhOPZ2u7C_YC&q=%22more+fun+to+draw%22+%22a+pain+in+the+butt+for+other+people%22&pg=PA95|year=2003|publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing|isbn=978-1-893905-25-2|page=95|quote="Wonder Woman's hair is made into waves more fun to draw. A lot more fun for me, a pain in the butt for other people."}}</ref> Later when he became the artist on ''Avengers'', [[Alan Davis]] asked to change the design because it didn't work well with his simpler, less detailed style.<ref>{{cite book |last1= Nolen-Weathington|first1= Eric|title= Modern Masters Volume 1: Alan Davis|date= 2003|location= Raleigh, North Carolina|publisher= TwoMorrows Publishing|isbn= 1-893905-19-5 |page= 92}}</ref> During Busiek's stories, Wanda once again becomes a powerful sorceress by tapping into the energy of "chaos magic." Busiek clarifies her true mutant power is to tap into magical energy fields and manipulate them, just as Magneto taps into and manipulates electromagnetic fields.

Marvel decided to relaunch the ''Avengers'' series again, with a new roster, headquarters, atmosphere, and creative direction. To promote the change and gain reader interest, the inciting event was depicted in the 2004 story ''[[Avengers Disassembled]]'' written by [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and with art by [[David Finch (comics)|David Finch]]. In the story, a remark by the [[Wasp (character)|Wasp]] causes Wanda to remember her children (how and when Wanda once again lost the memories of her children is not explained). She suddenly relives the trauma of their loss and feels betrayed by the Avengers, both for allowing Harkness to cloud her memories and for being unable to save her children from Mephisto. Emotionally overwhelmed and simultaneously experiencing a drastic increase in power, Wanda kills Agatha Harkness and causes the Avengers to suffer their "worst day" by altering the minds of [[She-Hulk]] and [[Iron Man]], and causing simulations of the villain [[Ultron]] and the alien [[Kree]] to attack. This leads to the apparent deaths of different characters and the destruction of [[Avengers Mansion]]. Wanda is discovered to be the culprit and stopped, after which she falls into a coma. The Avengers disband, then reform in ''[[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]''. To explain her sudden increase in power, the sorcerer [[Doctor Strange|Dr. Strange]] says Wanda's actual mutant power is to reshape reality, adding that her talk of tapping into "chaos magic" is a lie because such a force does not exist. This contradicted earlier comics where Dr. Strange himself uses chaos magic and "catastrophe magic", and later Marvel stories confirm chaos magic is a real force that sorcerers can access.

Wanda was seen again in the limited series ''[[House of M]]'', creating an alternate version of Earth. When Earth's heroes defeat her, she causes "M-Day," removing the powers of most mutants on Earth. She then appeared in the ''[[Young Avengers]]'' follow-up series, ''[[Avengers: The Children's Crusade]]'' (2010-2012), which retconned ''Avengers Disassembled'' by revealing Wanda's extreme actions and enhanced power levels during recent stories were the result of tapping into an enormous source of energy that then corrupted her, similar to when she was possessed by Chthon, brainwashed by That Which Endures, and corrupted by Immortus. This was now the explanation as to how she was able to warp reality and why she would no longer be that powerful, and partially exonerated her from her actions against the Avengers and during M-Day. Wanda was again portrayed as someone who wanted to atone for her past, accepting partial responsibility rather than completely blaming outside influences, allying herself with [[Doctor Doom]]. ''Avengers: The Children's Crusade'' also now referred to the children of William and Thomas not as "pieces" of Mephisto's essence but as "lost souls" who had been taken away by Mephisto, indicating they actually had been alive and explaining how they could be reincarnated as the teenage heroes [[Speed (Marvel Comics)|Speed]] and [[Wiccan (character)|Wiccan]].

The Scarlet Witch is a regular character in ''[[Uncanny Avengers]]'' (2012), beginning with issue #1. The 2014 [[AXIS (comics)|''AXIS'']] crossover retconned the character's parentage again, revealing Magneto is not biologically her father, contrary to that relationship's place in the canon for 32 years. In 2015, it was revealed in ''Uncanny Avengers'' (Vol. 2) #4 that she and Pietro are not mutants but humans who received superhuman genetics due to the experiments of the High Evolutionary. In Wanda's case, the High Evolutionary's genetic tampering made her more powerful in magic than she would have been otherwise. This plot twist was published while [[Marvel Studios]] and [[20th Century Fox]] had a legal dispute over the film rights to the character. Fox had a film license for the X-Men, related characters, and most Marvel characters designated as mutants, while Marvel Studios was about to introduce Wanda and Pietro in the 2015 film ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.newsarama.com/22948-did-marvel-comics-just-solve-the-mcu-s-scarlet-witch-quicksilver-father-problem-spoilers.html|title= Did Marvel Comics Just 'Solve' the MCU's Scarlet Witch, Quicksilver Father Problem?|first= Chris|last= Arrant|date= December 10, 2014|work= Newsarama|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20161019174634/http://www.newsarama.com/22948-did-marvel-comics-just-solve-the-mcu-s-scarlet-witch-quicksilver-father-problem-spoilers.html|archive-date= October 19, 2016|url-status=live|access-date=April 18, 2016}}</ref>

Under the [[All-New, All-Different Marvel]] branding, the character received her own ongoing solo series from late 2015 to 2017, written by [[James Robinson (writer)|James Robinson]] and illustrated by a rotating team of artists. Robinson explained he was influenced by the work of [[Matt Fraction]] and [[David Aja]] on the ''[[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]]'' title: "... they managed to stay true to the character in the Avengers while also taking it in a fresh direction, so it wasn't just that same Avengers character doing solo things, which I don't think ever really works for any sustained period of time for any of those second-tier characters."<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/james-robinson-promises-unique-adventures-for-wanda-in-new-scarlet-witch-series|title= James Robinson Promises Unique Adventures for Wanda in New ''Scarlet Witch'' Series|first= Meagan|last= Damore|date= August 25, 2015|website= Comic Book Resources|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150905061112/http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/james-robinson-promises-unique-adventures-for-wanda-in-new-scarlet-witch-series|archive-date= September 5, 2015|url-status=live}} Archive requires scrolldown</ref> The 2015 ''Scarlet Witch'' series has Wanda investigating supernatural threats with Agatha Harkness at her side. During the series, she encounters the evil Declan Dane, the Emerald Warlock, who declares himself Wanda's arch-enemy. In issues #3 and #4, a journey through the mystical dimension known as the Witch's Road allows Wanda to meet the spirit of her true mother, a sorceress named Natalya Maximoff who also uses the title "Scarlet Witch." Wanda discovers her adopted parents are actually her biological aunt and uncle, and that her bloodline includes many magic-users who chose to identify with the color scarlet. Wanda realizes powerful sorcerers often identify with complex rather than basic or primary colors. Now feeling more secure in her identity, Wanda confidently returns to the role of superhero and resumes her association with the Avengers.

==Fictional character biography==
Throughout the generations, different members of the Maximoff family, a [[Romani people|Romani]] bloodline, are born with a strong talent for magic. Several members of the family associate their magic with scarlet, calling themselves Scarlet Witch or Scarlet Warlock, just as certain other sorcerers choose to identify with complex rather than basic colors. One Scarlet Warlock has two children, his daughter Natalya Maximoff, a powerful magic-user, and his son Django Maximoff, a medicine man and storyteller whose latent magic abilities bring a strange life to his puppets. Among Natalya's people, red is considered a color of bad luck. Natalya enjoys this and happily adopts the title Scarlet Witch, believing it implies misfortune for her enemies. As the Scarlet Witch, she spends years fighting a variety of mystical enemies that threaten humanity, sometimes aided by allies such as the centuries-old sorceress [[Agatha Harkness]] of New Salem.<ref>''Scarlet Witch'' #11 (Marvel Comics, 2017).</ref> Her brother Django remains with their tribe, making a home in Serbia with his wife Marya. Django and Marya have twins, Ana and Mateo, but the children tragically die while still young.<ref>''The Avengers'' #182 (Marvel Comics, 1979).</ref>

While still living in [[Serbia]], Natalya has twin children, Pietro Maximoff and Wanda Marya Maximoff. According to the demonic Elder God called [[Chthon (Marvel Comics)|Chthon]], he witnesses Wanda's birth and infuses her with some of his own magical energy in hopes to one day use her as a host vessel. ''The Avengers'' #187 (Marvel Comics, 1979). While she battles more villains and menaces, Natalya leaves her children in the care of her brother and sister in law who now live with other [[Romani in Serbia|Romany]] in [[Novi Pazar]], Serbia. The area is soon attacked by the [[New Men (Marvel Comics)|Knights of Wundagore]]. Their leader and creator, the geneticist Herbert Wyndham, known to many as the [[High Evolutionary]], wants to experiment on children who have the genetics to possibly achieve great superhuman power. Knowing Wanda and Pietro are children of a powerful witch, a local priest gives the twins to the High Evolutionary to stop the attacks. The twins are taken to the High Evolutionary's base at [[Mount Wundagore]] in the neighboring country of [[Transia]]. According to the High Evolutionary, his experiments allows the twins the potential for power later (and, by chance, also wrongly makes them appear to be mutants to most tests), but the results are not as impressive as he desires.<ref name=":7">''Uncanny Avengers'' (vol. 2) #4 (Marvel Comics, 2015).</ref>

While the children are still at Mount Wundagore, they are attended by [[Bova (comics)|Bova]], a cow engineered by the High Evolutionary who acts as a nurse. Later on, the retired superhero the [[Whizzer (Robert Frank)|Whizzer]] (Robert Frank) and his pregnant wife [[Miss America (Madeline Joyce)|Miss America]] (Madeline Joyce Frank) arrive at Mount Wundagore. Madeline goes into labor, and both baby and mother die. Hoping to ease the suffering of her husband, and believing the children would be better raised away from Mount Wundagore, Bova tells Frank the twins are his children.

Tracking down her children, Natalya Maximoff attacks Wundagore and fights the High Evolutionary's forces to a stand-still. During the attack, she is killed by the father of Wanda and Pietro. Either because he has no more use for the children or is impressed by the heroism of their mother, the High Evolutionary tracks down Django and Marya Maximoff and gives them the twins. Django and Marya decide not to explain the twins' true heritage to them until they are old enough to accept their real mother was a sorceress who died in battle (the Maximoffs mistakenly believe the High Evolutionary's forces killed her).<ref name=":2" /> Before the twins reach their tenth birthday, they start to show signs of superhuman abilities, with Pietro using superhuman speed and Wanda casting minor hexes that cause a variety of effects, such as momentarily moving or levitating objects.

Locals who hold prejudice against the Roma people hear rumors of the twins' powers. After Django steals bread to feed his family, the locals attack the Roma tribe, burning down their homes. The Maximoff wagon is set on fire with Marya still inside and Django is beaten by multiple attackers. Wanda and Pietro flee, believing Django and Marya are dead. Unknown to them, Marya survives the fire, though her body and face suffer serious burns and scarring. Django, mourning the loss of yet more children and overwhelmed by guilt that he couldn't protect Marya, suffers a break from reality. He convinces himself Wanda and Pietro were his biological children Ana and Mateo, and that Marya is dead. He starts a new, solitary life, while Marya returns to Serbia and stays with friends.<ref name=":2" />

Repressing much of the memory of their trauma, Wanda and Pietro travel through Transia as homeless orphans for years. During this time, the aggressive Pietro becomes almost obsessively protective of his sister, even referring to her as his "little sister" because she is 13 minutes younger. Wanda's "hex power" becomes focused enough that she can instantly cause bad luck for enemies. When the twins are in their late teens, Wanda uses her power to save a child. This leads to locals accusing her of witchcraft and attempting to burn her alive at a stake. Having heard reports of the twins, the mutant terrorist Magneto arrives and saves her.<ref name=":0" /> Learning from the two Maximoffs that their powers emerged naturally and weren't the result of an outside force (as far as they knew), Magneto concludes Wanda and Pietro are mutants. Later scans seems to confirm they each possess the X-gene, which marks a mutant human from an average human.<ref name=":7" />

Telling them they now owe him a debt for his rescue, Magneto makes them his first recruits for the original [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] (later simply called the Brotherhood of Mutants).<ref name=":0">''Uncanny X-Men'' #4 (Marvel Comics, 1964).</ref> Pietro adopts the codename Quicksilver, while Wanda assumes the name Scarlet Witch. Initially, it is indicated she gets the name from an accusation shouted by a person hoping to burn her at the stake. Later, Wanda reveals the name came into her mind when she first realized she had powers, a sign she was inheriting her mother's magical abilities. During their missions alongside Magneto against the heroic X-Men, the twins only help reluctantly. At times, they work to prevent the X-Men and Magneto's human targets from being seriously harmed or killed. Wanda also deals with the unwanted advances of teammates [[Toad (Marvel Comics)|Toad]] and [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]].<ref name=":0" />

===The Avengers===
When Magneto is abducted by the cosmic entity known as the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]], the original Brotherhood team dissolves and the twins declare their debt now paid.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=Lee, Stan|penciller=Kirby, Jack|inker=Stone, Chic|story=The Triumph of Magneto!|title=X-Men|issue=#11|date=May 1965}}</ref> Wishing to atone for their crimes and help stop threats like Magneto, Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch contact the Avengers. At the time, the group's founding roster is ready to go their separate ways. Accepting the twins, as well as the archer Hawkeye who had been manipulated into committing crimes and fighting Iron Man in the past, Captain America becomes leader of this new Avengers team. The group is jokingly called by some "Cap's Kooky Quartet."<ref>''The Avengers'' #16 (Marvel Comics, 1965).</ref>

Wanda is accidentally shot on a mission against Magneto. Enraged, Quicksilver leaves the Avengers with his wounded sister and rejoins Magneto.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Roy Thomas|Thomas, Roy]]| penciller= [[John Buscema|Buscema, John]]| inker= Buscema, John| story= Mine is the Power| title= The Avengers|issue= #49 | date= February 1968}}</ref> After a pair of encounters with the X-Men, the twins reaffirm that they don't believe in Magneto's cause or methods and leave him. Some time later, Wanda and Pietro are kidnapped along with several other mutants by the robot [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]], but are subsequently freed by the X-Men.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Thomas, Roy | penciller= [[Neal Adams|Adams, Neal]]| inker= [[Tom Palmer (comics)|Palmer, Tom]]| story= Do Or Die, Baby!| title= X-Men| issue= #59 | date= August 1969}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Thomas, Roy | penciller= Adams, Neal| inker= Palmer, Tom| story= In the Shadow of...Sauron!| title= X-Men| issue= #60 | date= September 1969}}</ref>

Scarlet Witch then falls in love with recent Avenger recruit the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]]. While he is an android or "synthezoid" (built from a copy of the original [[Human Torch (android)|Human Torch]], a synthetically created man), Vision's personality programming is partly based on the brainwaves of [[Wonder Man]], allowing him to develop his own mind and emotions. Initially guarded because he fears he is a soulless machine and cannot have a relationship with a human, Vision later reveals his feelings for Wanda. Quicksilver objects due to his belief that a "robot" is not capable of genuine love, while Hawkeye resents the romance because he has feelings for Wanda himself.<ref name="Avengers #109 March 1973">{{cite comic|writer=Englehart, Steve|penciller=Heck, Don|inker=[[Frank McLaughlin (artist)|McLaughlin, Frank]]|story=The Measure of a Man!|title=The Avengers|issue=#109|date=March 1973}}</ref> Despite this, the entire team (except for Quicksilver) comes to approve of the pairing.

Wanda and Pietro meet Robert Frank, who reveals he believes them to be his children. Hearing Frank describe how his wife died in childbirth at Mount Wundagore, Wanda believes his story and for some time afterward refers to herself as Wanda Frank.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Thomas, Roy| penciller= [[Rich Buckler|Buckler, Rich]]| inker= [[Dan Adkins|Adkins, Dan]]| story= Nuklo--the Invader That Time Forgot!| title= Giant-Size Avengers|issue= #1| date= August 1974}}</ref> Later on, Django Maximoff comes to America and tells Wanda and Pietro they are his children Ana and Mateo. The twins journey with Django to Wundagore. There, Wanda is temporarily possessed by the demon [[Chthon (Marvel Comics)|Chthon]], who claims he witnessed her birth and imbued some of his own magical energy into her so she could be a host later on. Meanwhile, Quicksilver meets Bova who confirms that neither the Maximoffs nor the Franks are the twins' parents. Bova claims she delivered Wanda and Pietro herself when a pregnant woman named Magda came to Wundagore after fleeing her dangerous husband, a vengeful man with superhuman abilities. At the end of the adventure, Wanda is freed from her possession and Django dies. Mourning him and wishing to honor that he and his wife raised them for a time, Wanda and Pietro drop the Frank surname and use Maximoff as their last name again.<ref name="Avengers' 1979" /> Realizing she has a talent for magic, Wanda becomes an apprentice to the sorceress [[Agatha Harkness]], gaining greater control over her hexes and learning true magic. Agatha does not reveal she knew Wanda's mother Natalya or that Wanda and Pietro are mistaken in thinking they're mutants.<ref name=":1" />

The Scarlet Witch and the Vision get married. While the team approves, Quicksilver still objects and some members of the public are angered by the event, believing neither a mutant nor an android can legally be married.<ref name=":2" /> Some time later, the two take a leave of absence from the Avengers in order to establish a life for themselves outside of the team and spend some time focusing on their relationship.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Shooter, Jim| penciller= [[Gene Colan|Colan, Gene]]| inker= Green, Dan| story= ...By Force of Mind!| title= The Avengers|issue= #211| date= September 1981}}</ref> The two move to a house in the suburbs of [[Leonia, New Jersey]].<ref>''The Vision and the Scarlet Witch'' #1 (Marvel Comics, 1982).</ref> The couple meet Robert Frank again, who learns Wanda and Pietro are not his children. He then dies trying to protect Wanda, Vision, and his true son [[Nuklo]] from his old enemy [[Isbisa]].

Around this time, Magneto attempts once again to track down what happened to Magda, his wife who fled from him years before. Magneto finds Bova, who tells him a woman named Magda arrived years ago, pregnant with twins. After the children Wanda and Pietro were born, Magda then fled. Concluding Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch are his own children, that Magda must have been pregnant when she fled him, Magneto leaves. Shortly after the birth of Pietro's daughter Luna, Magneto visits the child and tells Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch that he is their father, asking to start a new relationship with them. Wanda and Pietro are uneasy about the revelation that Magneto is their father, but accept his claim.<ref>''The Vision and the Scarlet Witch'' #4 (Marvel Comics, published in 1982, cover-dated February, 1983).</ref> Later, prejudiced neighbors burn down Vision and Wanda's house, and they take up residence in Avengers Mansion again, rejoining the team.<ref>''The Avengers'' #252 (Marvel Comics).</ref>

When the alien computer ISAAC takes over Vision's personality, he becomes corrupt and takes over international computer and security systems as part of a plan for global domination. He is restored to his proper mind, now having a stronger sense of identity, deciding he is not a copy of Wonder Man but more like a twin. The US government insists on confining Vision and studying him so he can't be taken over by another computer again, claiming that as an Avenger he must comply with orders from the US government. To ensure his freedom, Wanda and Vision quit the Avengers again, returning to a life as private citizens and purchasing a new home in Leonia, New Jersey.<ref>''The Vision and the Scarlet Witch'' (vol. 2) #1 (Marvel Comics, 1985).</ref> Vision then reveals his stronger sense of identity has also led to a desire to have a family with Wanda. While he hopes her magic can make this possible, Wanda is doubtful.

The Vision and Wanda are kidnapped by the residents of New Salem, who reveal they recently killed Agatha Harkness. During a magical ceremony, the corrupt leader of New Salem is defeated, causing excess magical energy to go wild. Using Agatha's lessons of tapping into different magical sources, Wanda taps into the excess energy and channels it safely away. Before she finishes, she hears Agatha's spirit tell her to use the incredible magical power while she's still connected to it. Instinctively, Wanda uses it to make herself pregnant.<ref>''The Vision and the Scarlet Witch'' (vol. 2) #3 (Marvel Comics, 1985).</ref> Months later, Wanda's old Brotherhood of Mutants teammate Toad attacks Leonia in order to take her as his bride. Seeing she is now eight months pregnant, he is repulsed and Wanda defeats him. Wanda later goes into labor and is attended by the physician and sorcerer Dr. Strange, who is surprised when she gives birth to twins. The boys are named Thomas (for Phineas Thomas Horton, the scientist who created the android Human Torch) and William (in reference to Wonder Man's real name, Simon Williams).<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Englehart, Steve| penciller= Howell, Richard| inker= [[Frank Springer|Springer, Frank]]| story= Double Sized Climax!| title= The Vision and the Scarlet Witch | volume= 2| issue= #12| date= September 1986}}</ref> Eventually, the Vision and Scarlet Witch relocate their family to Los Angeles, joining the new [[West Coast Avengers]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Englehart, Steve| penciller= [[Al Milgrom|Milgrom, Al]]| inker= Machlan, Mike| story= Tales to Astonish Part Two: Prisoners of the Slave World| title= West Coast Avengers| volume= 2| issue= #35| date= July 1988}}</ref>

=== Loss of marriage and children ===
Believing the Vision may have downloaded state secrets when he temporarily had international power and could do so again, various governments agree to a joint operation. Operatives kidnap and dismantle Vision, wiping out his personality.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' (vol. 2) #42-45 - "Vision Quest" (Marvel Comics, 1989)."</ref> Vision is then rebuilt, his red-colored skin now chalk-white. While his memories are mostly restored, he is now without emotions. Scarlet Witch hopes to restore his personality with Wonder Man's help, but he refuses due to his own secret feelings for Wanda and his uneasiness of choosing to create a copy of his emotions in someone else. Wanda seeks out help in restoring Vision's emotions but becomes corrupted by a parasitic life form called That Which Endures. Under its influence, Wanda turns against the Avengers. That Which Endures is then defeated and Wanda's mind restored.<ref name=":4" />

Agatha Harkness arrives (explaining that true witches have learned to protect themselves from burning and other methods non-witches have used to kill them) and reveals Thomas and William are not real but the result of Wanda suffering a "hysterical pregnancy" that influenced her magic and created constructs. Wanda's powers cannot create life, so the "souls" of the twins were drawn from scattered pieces of the demon lord Mephisto, whose power had been split into several pieces after a battle with the powerful [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]], son of Reed and Sue Richards of the [[Fantastic Four]].<ref>{{cite comic|writer=Byrne, John|penciller=Byrne, John|inker=[[Jerry Ordway|Ordway, Jerry]]|story=Back from Beyond|title=[[Fantastic Four]]|issue=277|date=April 1985}}</ref> Mephisto arrives and re-absorbs the life energies of the children into himself, restoring his power and seemingly wiping them from existence. Realizing this has created a connection between the demon lord and the Scarlet Witch, Agatha temporarily removes Wanda's memories of her children, causing a mental shock to Mephisto that allows his defeat.<ref name=":3" /> It is later revealed Vision suspected the children were only magical projections and had attempted to discuss it with Wanda, but she refused to listen.<ref name=":11">''The Vision'' (vol. 2) #7 (Marvel Comics, 2016).</ref>

Years later, the Young Avengers team is created, including Billy Kaplan in its ranks, a teenager first called "Asgardian" and then later "Wiccan." After the team meets teenage hero Tommy Shepherd, who calls himself Speed, Billy correctly concludes he and Tommy are the reincarnated twins of Wanda and Vision. The story ''[[Avengers: The Children's Crusade]]'' indicates Mephisto lied to Wanda about the nature of her children, reavling William and Thomas were "lost souls" who were raised by Wanda and Vision after her magic allowed them to be physically born, only to then have their lives "taken" by Mephisto. How Mephisto lost the two souls while absorbing the energy of their physical forms, and how the children were then reincarnated as babies born years before Wanda and Vision's marriage, babies who belonged to two different families, is not explained.<ref name=":16">''Avengers: The Children's Crusade'' #1-9 (Marvel Comics, 2010-2012).</ref>

=== Nexus being ===
Immediately after losing her children, Wanda is brainwashed again, this time to become a "[[Atlantis Attacks|Bride of Set]]." She is freed from control but becomes catatonic, apparently as a result of recent traumas. Believing he can't help Wanda and isn't needed with the west coast team, Vision returns to the NYC-based Avengers team. Wonder Man offers the use of his brainwaves to restore Vision's emotions, but the android refuses, believing he is now a separate person from whom he was before and not wishing to accept a copy of someone else's identity. Days after Vision leaves, Wanda becomes responsive again, now with incredibly enhanced power and a personality that hates humans and delights in suffering. She attacks the Avengers, sexually assaults Wonder Man, and rejoins with Magneto (who himself recently has returned to his terrorist ways after spending some time working with the X-Men).<ref name=":5" /> Investigating Wanda's change in personality and power level, Agatha Harkness discovers both changes are caused by the time villain Immortus.<ref name=":6" /> Realizing Wanda is a nexus being, a person whose very existence affects probability and timelines, Immortus hopes to use this great power for himself. For years, he has manipulated Wanda's life, hoping (like Chthon in the past) to use her as his pawn so he can increase his power.

As the Avengers battle Immortus, Agatha reminds Wanda of her love for her friends and family. Realizing she has been manipulated, Wanda gives up the nexus energies inside her. No longer a nexus being, her mind and full memories of Thomas and William are restored.<ref name=":6" /> Defeated and no longer having use for the Scarlet Witch without her nexus energy, Immortus leaves. Wanda returns to the Avengers but is now seemingly powerless.<ref name=":6" /> With Vision still unable to feel or reciprocate love, he and Wanda have their marriage annulled. Soon afterward, Wonder Man makes his romantic feelings for Wanda clear, but she tells him she only sees him as a friend. This leads to resentment and tension for some time.

Weeks after releasing her reality-warping Nexus energy and being freed from Immortus's control, Wanda's original hex power returns when Pietro needs her help. She finds her power is now unreliable, operating on the same level as when she first joined the Brotherhood of Mutants.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #65–68 (Marvel Comics, 1990).</ref> To compensate for her lower power level, she studies magic again, seeking help from Agatha and Dr. Strange when faced with magical threats. While practicing honing her talents, Wanda accidentally creates a window that seems to show an alternate timeline where she, Vision, and their children remain together. Happy to see that somewhere in the multiverse her children are real and happy, and glad her memories of them returned after only a short time, Wanda believes she can cope with the loss of family she's suffered.<ref name=":12" /> When Vision returns to Avengers West to help against the villain Ultron, Wanda hopes they might resume their romance but is disheartened to see Vision still lacks emotion and regards himself as a different person than the one who married her.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #89–91 (Marvel Comics, 1992).</ref> Later, Wanda is nominated as leader of the Avengers West team.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Thomas, Roy|penciller= Ross, David|inker= Dzon, Tim|story= Dying To Get Out|title= Avengers West Coast|issue= #98|date= September 1993}}</ref>

=== Force Works ===

The members of Avengers West are called to Avengers Mansion in NYC to discuss whether or not the team California-based team is a failed experiment, considering some of their defeats, the destruction of their headquarters, and the loss of different members. A vote results in Avengers West officially dissolving, its members now designated as reservists of the main Avengers team. Rather than accept this status, Iron Man quits, prompting the other former members of Avengers West to follow suit.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Dan Abnett|Abnett, Dan]]; [[Andy Lanning|Lanning, Andy]]|penciller= Ross, David|inker= Dzon, Tim|story= The Avengers West Coast Are Finished! |title= Avengers West Coast|issue= #102|date= January 1994}}</ref> In Ventura, California, Iron Man forms a new, more proactive team called [[Force Works]] and asks Wanda to be leader.

Wanda is with the Avengers and the [[Fantastic Four]] when the two teams fight the powerful villain [[Onslaught (Marvel Comics)|Onslaught]]. During their final battle, Vision is seriously injured and asks for Wanda, asking her to hold him.

===Chaos magic===
Now back home, the Avengers discuss reforming but are attacked by [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan le Fay]], who kidnaps Wanda. She uses the Scarlet Witch as a conduit for magical forces, enhancing her probability powers to such a degree that she is able to warp reality according to Morgan's wishes.<ref name=":19">''The Avengers'' (vol. 3) #1-3 (Marvel Comics, 1998).</ref><ref>Manning "1990s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 289</ref> During this adventure, Wanda resurrects Wonder Man as an energy being by summoning his ionic energies back into a humanoid form. After the encounter with Morgan, the Scarlet Witch has an increase in power and realizes she can access magic used by others. Following the battle with Morgan, Wanda repeatedly checks on Vision, who takes weeks to recuperate from injuries he suffered. Vision, afraid to hurt Wanda again if they attempted to have a relationship again, insists that while he may have a personality again, he is still a different person than the one she married. Conflicted about her feelings for Vision and his seemingly cold and harsh attitude toward her, Wanda inadvertently summons Wonder Man again, who comforts her. Later on, she restores Wonder Man to physical form.

Wanda seeks help from Agatha Harkness about her increased power. Agatha explains Wanda's mutant genes allow her to directly access magical energies, explaining her ability to learn powerful sorcery so quickly.<ref name=":13">''The Avengers'' (vol. 3) #10 (Marvel Comics, 1998).</ref> By now channeling [[chaos magic]], the same magic Chthon imbued her with soon after her birth, the Scarlet Witch becomes a powerful sorceress despite her lack of years of training. Agatha also points out that Wanda's own self-doubt and worry about living up to what she perceives as the expectations of others has held her back from realizing the full potential of this power and accessing real chaos magic before.<ref name=":14">''The Avengers'' (vol. 3) #11 (Marvel Comics, 1998).</ref> After these talks and a battle against the Grim Reaper, Wanda becomes a more formidable superhero, now considered one of the most powerful Avengers alongside heroes such as Thor and Carol Danvers. While she can't bend reality to her will and isn't a sorcerer supreme, it is later said that even those who have the Phoenix Force now have cause to fear her.<ref name=":8">''Avengers vs. X-Men'' #6 (Marvel Comics).</ref> Following another battle, the temporary absence of Iron Man and Captain America leads the team to decide Wanda is the natural choice to assume the duties of Avengers deputy leader and she accepts.<ref name=":15">''The Avengers'' (vol. 3) #13 (Marvel Comics, 1999).</ref>

Wanda realizes she has been in denial of growing feelings for Wonder Man for some time and the two begin a relationship.<ref name=":14" /> Later on, Wanda realizes Vision lied about still thinking of himself as a new person and has regained the full emotional connections to his memories before he was dismantled, including their relationship.<ref>''The Avengers'' (vol. 3) #12 (Marvel Comics, 1999).</ref> Sympathetic that Vision misses her, Wanda remains firm about leaving their relationship in the past and continuing her romance with Simon, adding that a reunion may have been possible earlier if her former husband hadn't chosen to lie and close himself off.<ref name=":15" /> Later, she has a copy of her own brain patterns made and gifts it to Vision, suggesting that one day if he wishes he can create a friend or love interest who is similar to her and understands him but is not an exact copy of her, just as he and Wonder Man are similar but not exact copies of each other.<ref name=":11" /> Months later, Wonder Man breaks up with Wanda.<ref>''The Avengers'' (vol. 3) #51 (Marvel Comics, 2002).</ref> Weeks afterward, Wanda and Vision discuss possibly resuming their relationship.<ref>''The Avengers'' (vol. 3) #57 (Marvel Comics, 2002).</ref>

===Reality-warping era===
{{Main|Avengers Disassembled|House of M|Decimation (comics)}}

Through circumstances not explained, Wanda once again loses the memories of her children's existence, as well as the memories of the years spent learning to coping with the loss afterward.<ref name=":12" /> When she hears the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] reference the twins, Wanda's memories come flooding back, causing her to relive the trauma. It is later revealed in ''[[Avengers: The Children's Crusade]]'' that at this point, feeling betrayed that her teammates allowed her mind to be tampered with, the Scarlet Witch seeks out help from the sorcerer and scientist [[Doctor Doom]], hoping he can restore her children to life. To do so, they summon a mysterious and powerful cosmic force that merges with her and increases her power a hundredfold, leaving her emotionally broken, similar to what happened with Chthon, That Which Endures, and Immortus before.<ref name=":9" /> Wanda becomes enraged at the Avengers for allowing her children to die and letting Agatha Harkness tamper with her memories, leading to the events of ''[[Avengers Disassembled]]''.

After killing Agatha, Scarlet Witch secretly launches a campaign of terror against the Avengers, influencing minds and creating simulated enemies to attack them. As a result, the Vision is destroyed by a maddened She-Hulk, Hawkeye is killed while fighting a simulated Kree soldier, and [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Scott Lang]] is apparently killed in an explosion (it was later revealed that he survived, saved by Wanda's future self who teleported him to the future). With help from Earth's heroes, Doctor Strange defeats Wanda and she falls into a coma. Magneto arrives and then leaves with her. At this time, the general public learns of Wanda's actions.

Realizing the Avengers and the X-Men are seriously contemplating killing his sister due to her increased power and mental instability, Quicksilver convinces Scarlet Witch to use her powers to create a world where everyone has their heart's desire fulfilled, and where the two of them and Magneto rule over a world where mutants are not persecuted.<ref>''House of M'' #1-7 (Marvel Comics, 2005).</ref> Although this ''House of M'' reality warp initially succeeds, several heroes (Hawkeye, [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], and [[Layla Miller]]) regain their memories and join forces with others to restore reality. When Magneto discovers he is in a false reality and that Quicksilver is responsible, he murders the speedster. Wanda immediately resurrects her brother. Enraged she was not allowed to create a world where mutants were not persecuted by normal humans, she declares "No more mutants." Her power then causes "M-Day," with most of Earth's mutant population losing their X-gene and powers, including Magneto and Quicksilver (though each later has their powers restored). The event becomes known as "M-Day." Wanda then takes refuge in Transia, blocking her memory of her true identity.<ref>''House of M'' #8 (Marvel Comics, 2005).</ref> Both Beast and a resurrected Hawkeye find her at different times in Transia, but depart after confirming she has no memory of her past.<ref>''New Avengers'' #26 (Marvel Comics, 2007), ''X-Men: Endangered Species'' (Marvel Comics, 2007).</ref> Later, Doom finds her and takes her to Latveria, leaving behind a duplicate robot in Transia in case anyone else comes looking for Wanda.<ref name=":17" />

===Return to the Avengers===
====''The Children's Crusade''====
The teenage mystical hero [[Wiccan (comics)|Wiccan]] (Billy Kaplan) and his team, the [[Young Avengers]], meet a teenage superhuman [[Speed (comics)|Speed]]. Speed, whose name is Tommy, looks like he could be Wiccan's twin, except that his hair is silver. Although he and Speed were born to different families years before the Scarlet Witch's marriage to Vision, Wiccan concludes the two of them might somehow be reincarnations of Wanda's lost children Thomas and William. The Young Avengers, Magneto, Quicksilver, and the Avengers all try to locate Wanda, eventually finding her amnesiac in Latveria and engaged to [[Doctor Doom]].<ref name=":17">''Avengers: The Children's Crusade'' #2-3 (Marvel Comics, 2011).</ref> The gathered heroes learn the truth: after being accidentally reminded of her children's existence by [[Janet van Dyne]], Wanda had initially only wanted to find a way to resurrect Tommy and William and sought out Doom's help. Seeking to use Wanda as a weapon, Doom led her to the Life Force, a powerful mystical energy source.  According to Doom, Wanda cannot affect time and space on her own but is still inherently a nexus of magic, able to act as a conduit for different mystical forces and use their power to increase her own. Wanda's attempts to tap into the Life Force increased her power a hundredfold, once again allowing her to alter reality as she had as a nexus being, but also causing her to enter a maddened state and then cause the events of ''Avengers Disassembled''. Following the events of ''House of M'', Doom found Wanda and manipulated her again, convincing her to be his bride.<ref name=":16" />

Wanda regains her memories of her life and of her recent experiences during ''Avengers Assembled'' and ''House of M''. Overwhelmed by the guilt of having attacked her own friends and family,  Wanda attempts suicide but is interrupted and consoled by Wiccan. Wanda then seeks Doom's help in undoing the spell that erased many mutant powers after ''House of M''. Instead, Doom steals the reality-warping Life Force power for himself.<ref name=":9">''Avengers: The Children's Crusade'' #4-7 (Marvel Comics, 2012).</ref> Wanda and Wiccan steal back the power, defeating him. Before leaving, Doom, having truly grown to love Wanda and not wanting to see her punished, tells the gathered heroes Wanda would not have attacked the Avengers during ''[[Avengers Disassembled]]'' if he had not manipulated her into doing so (though it is unclear if he is lying).<ref name=":18" />

Her power now restored to the level she had before ''Avengers Disassembled'', Wanda exiles herself to solitude for a while, knowing many still hate her, particularly mutants, and believing she cannot blame it entirely on outside forces.<ref name=":18">''Avengers: The Children's Crusade'' #8-9 (Marvel Comics, 2012).</ref>

====''Avengers vs. X-Men''====
During the events of ''[[Avengers vs. X-Men]],'' [[Ms. Marvel]] and [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]] offer Wanda an official return to the Avengers team. Although she is initially reluctant, she follows them to Avengers Mansion. The Vision, now rebuilt and online again, angrily blames Wanda [[Avengers Disassembled|for manipulating and killing him]] during ''Avengers Disassembled''. Despite some protest, most of the Avengers defer to the Vision as a tearful Wanda leaves. Though Vision feels sympathy, he stands firm that Wanda has not regained trust yet.''<ref>''Avengers vs. X-Men'' #0 (Marvel Comics).</ref>''

When the Avengers go to retrieve the young mutant [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope Summers]] and are nearly defeated by a corrupt, [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Force]]-empowered Cyclops, Scarlet Witch arrives and saves them. Hope then leaves with Scarlet Witch.<ref name=":8" /> After further battles involving the Avengers and X-Men, Hope inherits the Phoenix Force. She and Wanda then combine their powers to apparently drive away the Phoenix from Earth by saying "No more Phoenix." This results in mutants across Earth regaining their powers, undoing some of the damage Wanda caused on M-Day.<ref>''Avengers vs. X-Men'' #7 (Marvel Comics).</ref> Despite this, many mutants maintain a hatred and fear of Wanda for causing the event in the first place.<ref name=":10">''House of X'' #4 (Marvel Comics).</ref>

With the Avengers Unity Squad, the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver later take a trip to [[Counter-Earth (comics)|Counter-Earth]].<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' (vol. 2) #1-2 (Marvel Comics, 2015).</ref> After being tracked down and defeated by Luminous (a superhuman woman created from the genetic material of Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver), Wanda and Pietro are brought to the High Evolutionary. He claims Django and Marya Maximoff were their true parents, implying the twins actually are the lost Ana and Mateo. He also reveals that not only are Magneto and Magda not their parents, but they are not mutants and have no X-gene. He explains their superhuman traits are the result of him experimenting on them as children, then abandoning them to the Maximoffs when he was unsatisfied with the results.<ref name=":7" /> After the High Evolutionary is defeated, Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver return to Earth with the Avengers Unity Division.

===All-New, All-Different Marvel: ''Scarlet Witch'' (2016–2017)===
Leaving the Avengers so she can reassert her sense of self, Wanda becomes a troubleshooter specializing in magical threats, aided by the ghost of [[Agatha Harkness]]. Agatha confirms she has known all along Wanda wasn't a mutant or the child of Magneto, but chose not to say anything lest she influence the Scarlet Witch down the wrong path and disrupt her fate. During her adventures, Wanda quickly concludes some force or hidden enemy is disrupting magic all over Earth. During her initial adventures, she fights Declan Dane, the Emerald Warlock, who decides he will now be Wanda's arch-enemy.<ref>''Scarlet Witch'' (vol. 2) #1-2 (Marvel Comics, 2016).</ref>

While exploring the Witch's Road, a dimensional path existing outside normal space and time, Wanda meets Natalya Maximoff, another woman who calls herself the Scarlet Witch and a friend of Agatha.

After helping each other, Natalya realizes who Wanda must be just as she returns to her time period.<ref>''Scarlet Witch'' (vol. 2) #3 (Marvel Comics, 2016).</ref>

When the [[Civil War II|second superhero Civil War]] begins, Pietro asks Wanda for help but she refuses. She also says she resents Pietro still trying to tell her what to do as though she were a lost child, bluntly telling him that she has grown whereas his refusal to learn from his past mistakes marks him as a sociopath in her eyes. She invites Pietro to join her quest to learn more about Natalya Maximoff but he refuses.<ref>''Scarlet Witch'' (vol. 2) #9 (Marvel Comics, 2017).</ref>

Wanda joins forces with the spirits of Natalya and Agatha, and together the three witches weaken the chaos entity long enough for Quicksilver (whom Natalya summons) to destroy it. Wanda and Pietro reconcile. To save magic, Natalya sacrifices her spirit, knowing this means she will no longer be able to communicate with Wanda or even maintain her own identity as a ghost. Before she vanishes, Natalya reveals it was not the High Evolutionary who killed her when she attempted to rescue her children. She was killed by Wanda and Pietro's father. But she vanishes before she can reveal the identity of this man.<ref>''Scarlet Witch'' (vol. 2) #14 (Marvel Comics, 2017).</ref> After seeing her mother's sacrifice, and now having a stronger sense of her past and identity, Wanda re-dedicates herself to being a superhero and an Avenger.

===''Secret Empire''===
An alternate version of Captain America is created, one loyal to the terrorist organization Hydra. Taking the place of the real Steve Rogers, this "Hydra Cap" eventually attempts to take control over the United States in the ''[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]'' crossover. Wanda initially joins the fight to stop Hydra, but the gathered heroes fail. Afterward, Wanda is brainwashed into serving Hydra's version of the Avengers.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #1.

The true Captain America later returns and the events of the ''Secret Empire'' crossover are undone.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #9 (Marvel Comics).</ref>

===Dawn of X===
Magneto, Charles Xavier, and many of their mutant allies and enemies decide to create a [[House of X and Powers of X|sovereign nation]] state for mutants on the living island [[Krakoa]]. In this new mutant nation, Wanda is considered an [[enemy of the state]] of Krakoa for the events of M-Day, ranked as second on the list of most dangerous enemies to mutantkind, since the removal of the X-gene resulted in 986,420 deaths (the top enemy [[Bolivar Trask]] created the mutant-hunting [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] robots responsible for 16,521,618 deaths and counting). Magneto's former follower Exodus has called Wanda "the Great Pretender" in connection to the revelation that she is neither Magneto's daughter or a mutant at all and encouraged mutant children to hate her by imparting around campfires stories of her and how she took away mutant powers on M-Day.<ref name=":10" />

===''Empyre''===
During the "[[Empyre]]" storyline, flashbacks reveal that against the advice of Doctor Strange, Wanda tried to atone for her past sins and mistakes by addressing the genocide of 16 million mutants on the island [[Genosha]] committed years earlier at the hands of [[Cassandra Nova]]. She spends a year gathering arcane artifacts to redeem herself unaware the nation of Krakoa had already established resurrection protocols to bring back dead mutants and prevent further deaths. Her attempt to resurrect the millions of Genoshan mutants goes awry causing the mutants to return as [[zombie]]s.<ref>''Empyre: X-Men'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Wanda sought help from Doctor Strange, who gave her aid while also holding her accountable. Doctor Strange is able to counter Wanda's spell, but informs her that it will take roughly 30 days for her spell to wear off. So he creates a barrier around Genosha to prevent any undead from leaving. However, the barrier did not stop the living from entering the island though. Around this time, a group of [[Cotati (comics)|Cotati]] had set up base on Genosha as part of an attempted invasion of Wakanda, leading them to being attacked by the undead. A team of X-Men is sent to investigate as the Gateways on Krakoa were being affected and are soon overwhelmed by both aliens and Cotati until the spell wears off. After the Genoshan undead turn to dust, the X-Men leave unaware that these events had been caused by the Scarlet Witch.<ref>''Empyre: X-Men'' #3 (Marvel Comics).</ref> Since then, Wanda has continued to work with the Avengers and recently worked with a team of heroes that fought Cotati agents in the [[Savage Land]].<ref>''Empyre: Avengers'' #1 (Marvel Comics).</ref>

===''Hellfire Gala''===
Even though they are not related by blood, Magneto still believes there is a bond between himself and Wanda Maximoff and invites her to the first annual Hellfire Gala. Still ashamed of her actions against the mutant population via M-Day, Wanda declines and only agrees to see Magneto in private. After he promises to help alleviate the tension between herself and the mutant nation of Krakoa, they share a dance.<ref>''S.W.O.R.D.'' #6</ref> Soon afterwards, Wanda is seemingly found dead by her son Speed.<ref>''X-Factor'' (vol. 4) #10</ref>

===''The Trial of Magneto''===
Due to evidence Wanda's attacker possessed magnetic abilities, Magneto is deemed a prime suspect. Following the attack, the Avengers invade the mutant nation of Krakoa and a complicated confrontation ensues. Wanda is resurrected by the power of Krakoa's "resurrection protocols", used to restore mutants by recreating their bodies and then implanting a "back-up" copy of their mind previously recorded to the super-computer Cerebro. As her mind's last back-up to Cerebro was recorder before the events of ''Avengers Disassembled'', the resurrected Wanda clone has no memories of recent years. As others attempt to restore Wanda's mind, she is overwhelmed by the guilt of suddenly remembering the last few years and her actions, causing her to create physical constructs of monsters. Meanwhile, on the astral plane, the spirit of the murderer Wanda finds herself facing a vision of an older self who confronts her with uncomfortable truths she has denied. Realizing the need to heal by accepting her actions and forgiving herself, the three Wandas stop the monster attack and then merge together, resulting in a fully restored Wanda who now knows there is at least one possible future where she will grow old and wise.<ref name=":20">''X-Men: Trial of Magneto'' #1-5 (Marvel Comics).</ref>

Unwilling to explain their resurrection program to outsiders, the mutants of Krakoa tell the Avengers that someone attempted to murder Wanda but she did not die from the attack. Evidence is found against the mutant Toad, who is found guilty and punished, and the Avengers leave. It is revealed Wanda was secretly worked with the mutants Polaris, Legion, and Proteus to increase the capabilities the resurrection protocols but that doing so required her physical death. She recruited Magneto's help in arranging her own death, a suicide disguised by magic to look like a murder. Thanks to Wanda's plan, a pocket dimension "Waiting Room" is created which now allows all mutants to be resurrected, including those who never had a chance to manifest their X-gene and those whose minds were not able to be copied to the computer Cerebro. Learning this, many of the mutants of Krakoa refer to Wanda as a "Pretender" who has now become a "Redeemer." Wanda is now a welcome guest of the mutant nation, telling her story to children so they may learn from her mistakes.<ref name=":20" />

==Powers and abilities==
[[File:SteveEnglehart.jpg|thumb|Writer [[Steve Englehart]] first associated the Scarlet Witch's powers with [[witchcraft]].]]
When the Scarlet Witch was first created by Lee and Kirby, her main ability was a vaguely defined "hex power" that could cause random and unlikely things to affect her enemies or other targets, often in the form of "bad luck." These effects could be unpredictable, however, and thus not always helpful to Wanda. The vague and unpredictable nature of her power meant Wanda could use her ability in a variety of ways that helped the plot but also meant she couldn't easily solve all her problems.

Despite the character's name, the Scarlet Witch's powers stemmed not from witchcraft or magic but from being a mutant who could affect probability. Later stories gave her increased control, allowing her to release targeted "hex-bolts" that could cause enemy weapons to backfire, their abilities to fail, or the area around them to suffer sudden damage and instability. Eventually, she also became adept at casting energy blasts that could directly stun opponents. She later realizes her hex-bolts are the most basic use of chaos magic.<ref name=":15" />

Writer Steve Englehart decided the character could become more powerful and formidable by living up to her name. His stories revealed Wanda had a strong talent for magic, possibly caused by the demon Chthon giving her latent magical talent as a child. Under Englehart, Wanda studies spell casting and the manipulation of magical forces under the tutelage of [[Agatha Harkness]]. Along with increasing her control over the effects of her hexes, this allows her to counter, deflect, and block a variety of magical attacks.

Writer [[Kurt Busiek]] redefined Scarlet Witch's powers, explaining that like Magneto, her mutant ability allowed her to tap into and manipulate a specific form of energy. Busiek suggested Wanda may have originally developed the power to access energy related to the electromagnetic spectrum if she'd been left alone, but Chthon's interference soon after her birth influenced her genetics to tap into magical energy. Busiek depicted the sorceress Morgan le Fey remarking that while Wanda cannot fully warp time and space on her own (not since giving up her nexus being status), her ability to alter probability coupled with her magical talent meant others could use her as a conduit for multiple, powerful energies at once, and thus she could become a tool used to warp reality. Following her encounter with Morgan, Wanda learns that her hex abilities are an expression of [[chaos magic]], the same magic Chthon used.<ref name=":13" /> By trusting in herself more, Wanda learns how to directly tap into chaos magic to increase her power and achieve a variety of effects, making her one of Earth's most powerful magic users.<ref name=":14" /> She also realized she could manipulate other forms of energy (though this required greater focus and strength).<ref name="AvengersVol3#10">{{cite comic| writer= Busiek, Kurt| penciller= Pérez, George| inker= Vey, Al| story= Pomp & Pageantry| title= The Avengers| volume= 3| issue= 10 | date= November 1998}}</ref> During Busiek's run, as well as the subsequent run by [[Geoff Johns]], she was shown to be capable of large-scale spells given enough concentration and time to shape them to a specific goal, including the creation of a hurricane. Wanda's new chaos magic allows her to collect Wonder Man's near-immortal ionic energies and reconstitute them, allowing him temporary existence as an energy being and then eventually bringing him back to life as a physical being (although Wanda has been unable to resurrect normal human beings who are not energy-based life forms).<ref name="AvengersVol3#10" />  The series ''[[Avengers vs. X-Men|Avengers vs X-Men]]'' confirmed that Wanda now largely relies on chaos magic.

A 2015 ''Uncanny Avengers'' story revealed Wanda was never a mutant, despite the assumption of others and what certain scientific tests indicated. Her and Quicksilver's superhuman traits, the genes that allowed her to directly access magical energy sources, were the result of the High Evolutionary experimenting on them as infants. This is in line with Busiek's explanation for her powers, with only the classification of "mutant" being changed.

In the 2016–2017 ''Scarlet Witch'' comic series, it is confirmed Wanda was always born with the ability to utilize witchcraft, a trait she inherited from other members of her family. The High Evolutionary's genetic tampering gave greater and direct access to magical energies, making her more powerful than she may have been otherwise, but was not solely responsible for her magical abilities.

=== Reality warping ===

Due to her unique genetics, Wanda is a nexus of magical energy, able to instinctively tap into different mystical power sources more easily than even highly trained sorcerers. Because of this, Wanda has temporarily grained the power to alter reality on multiple occasions by taking energy from another person or outside force.

When she was temporarily linked to magical energies around the town of New Salem, a magic-user community, Wanda seemingly used that energy to make herself pregnant. Later on, during John Byrne's Avengers West Coast stories, Wanda was said to be able to create lifelike illusions if her desire to do so was great enough. She later becomes powerful enough to hold multiple Avengers paralyzed through force of will. Writers Roy and Dann Thomas revealed this power increase and the ability to cast illusions were all due to Wanda's status as a '''nexus being''', someone who has great influence over the reality around her and acts as an anchor point between timelines.<ref name=":5" /> The villain Immortus manipulated Wanda, causing a change of personality and drawing out her nexus energies in order to increase her overall power. Rather than be used as a tool by Immortus, Wanda completely released her nexus energies, giving up her ability to influence reality more than others.<ref name=":5" /> This restored her mind and the memories of her lost children, but also resulted in a temporary loss of her hex power. They returned weeks later, though weaker and unreliable. Wanda needed time and training to regain her previous power levels.

When the sorceress Morgan le Fey used Wanda as a conduit for different magical energy sources, this amplified Wanda's abilities.<ref name=":19" /> Morgan le Fey then used her to warp time and space, altering Earth to a more medieval setting and convincing the Avengers to act as her loyal servants and soldiers.<ref name=":19" /> When the adventure was over, Wanda's ability to warp time and minds vanished, but she now had a stronger ability to access magical energies on her own.<ref name=":13" />

Writer Brian Michael Bendis retconned Wanda's abilities in ''[[Avengers Disassembled]]''. The story stated that chaos magic did not exist (in contradiction to previous Marvel stories with Dr. Strange) and was not an energy source used to achieve greater power. Bendis wrote that Wanda's true mutant power was to warp reality itself, as well as influence minds. In ''[[House of M]]'', this new power was enough to change history through force of will, creating a new timeline. The later miniseries ''[[Avengers: The Children's Crusade]]'' restored Wanda's power to what it was before ''Avengers Disassembled'', again defining her as someone whose genes allow her to directly tap into magical fields, including chaos magic. Her actions during ''Avengers Disassembled'' and ''House of M'' were explained as a temporary power increase due to a magical entity that bonded with her, similar to her earlier possessions by Chthon and Immortus and her time as a tool of Morgan le Fey.<ref name="Avengers: The Children's Crusade">{{cite comic| writer= Heinberg, Allan| penciller= Cheung, Jim| inker= Morales, Mark; Livesay, John; Cheung, Jim| story= Doctor Doom is dead.| title= Avengers: The Children's Crusade| issue= 8| date= January 2012}}</ref>

==Reception==

=== Critical reception ===
George Marston of ''[[Newsarama|Newasrama]]'' called the Scarlet Witch "one of the most important characters in [[Marvel Comics]] history," writing, "Before Wanda was the growing center of the MCU, she was the heart-and-soul of the Avengers in comic books for years, with her long narrative sowing the seeds of some of the greatest - and most tragic - Marvel Comics stories ever. In comics, Wanda is considered a Nexus Being, an entity of unique Multiversal power. But in a more metatextual sense, she's something of a nexus being for the Marvel Universe's larger narrative thanks to the vast, wide-reaching array of characters to whom she is directly related - and whose lives she's had influence over. [...] Whether it's on the page or on-screen, any time Wanda Maximoff shows up, she has a way of magnetically drawing in all the subplots around her directly into her own complex story and bringing the characters involved into her ever-growing family. Whether Marvel is ready to admit it or not, we'll say it: Wanda Maximoff, the Scarlet Witch, is one of the most important characters in Marvel Comics history."<ref>{{Cite web |author1=George Marston |date=2021-09-24 |title=The Scarlet Witch is one of the most influential characters in Marvel Comics history |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/scarlet-witch-marvel-universe-wanda/ |access-date=2022-08-09 |website=gamesradar |language=en}}</ref> Dalton Norman of ''[[Screen Rant]]'' stated, "As Scarlet Witch recently proved in ''Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness'', characters from Marvel Comics can sometimes walk a fine line between heroism and villainy. The Avengers are known as the greatest collection of heroes in Marvel Comics, but occasionally a former villain can switch sides and join the squad. From Avengers mainstays such as Hawkeye to short-lived members such as fan-favorite Spider-Man foe Venom, even the most dastardly villains can have a change of heart. Though many former villains have joined the team, only a few left an impression on readers to be counted among the best the Avengers have to offer.Like her brother Pietro, Wanda Maximoff was created by the High Evolutionary, even though fans were led to believe she was a mutant for most of her existence in the comics. The powerful sorceress debuted as part of Magneto's Brotherhood of Evil Mutants but very quickly turned good after fighting the X-Men. Though she wasn't an original member of the team, Wanda's tenure as an Avenger has been one of the longest and most impactful. Her brushes with antiheroism have made her a fascinating character to follow, and her Avengers status carried over when she joined Hawkeye as a leader of the West Coast Avengers."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Norman |first=Dalton |date=2022-07-30 |title=Marvel Comics: 10 Villains Who Became Avengers |url=https://screenrant.com/marvel-comics-villains-became-avengers/ |access-date=2022-09-03 |website=ScreenRant |language=en-US}}</ref> Mason Downey of ''[[GameSpot]]'' asserted, "Much like her on-again-off-again romantic interest, Vision, Wanda Maximoff AKA Scarlet Witch has been rocketed into the pop culture mainstream by her prominent role in the Marvel Cinematic Universe--and that spotlight is only going to get brighter now that she's making her way to her very own show. [...] Wanda's publication history has stretched on for almost six decades, and in that time, the character has defied strict definition. Even her powers, which started as "hexes" and then gradually became cosmic-level reality warping, have never been easy to pin down or explain. But for as esoteric as Wanda is, and probably always will be, she does have some pretty easy to spot throughlines. Thematically, Wanda's existence in the Marvel Universe hinges on both change and evolution--she's used to explore the fear of things far outside our control and the complex balance of power and responsibility. If you think Peter Parker has it bad as a guy who can sling webs and do cool acrobatics, imagine being a person who can speak any idea she has into existence--even at the cost of hundreds of thousands of lives."<ref>{{Cite web |title=WandaVision: Wanda Maximoff's Insane Comic History Explained |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wandavision-wanda-maximoffs-insane-comic-history-explained/1100-6484674/ |access-date=2022-09-03 |website=GameSpot |language=en-US}}</ref> David Harth of ''[[CBR.com]]'' wrote, "Powers like Scarlett Witch's have led her to achieve things that other heroes and villains can only dream of, be they for good or ill.

Over the years, she's gone through a lot, as the trials and tribulations of her life proved to be too much for her more than once. Over the years, Scarlet Witch has done some amazing things.

Donald D. Markstein of ''[[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]]'' asserted, "The Scarlet Witch is unique among superheroes, and not just because she's the only one who wears a wimple. Her super power is unlike any other — she can alter probability so as to cause mishaps for her foes. In other words, she "hexes" them. At first her hexes were rather haphazard, but with years of practice, they've become both stronger and better controlled."<ref>{{Cite web |title=Don Markstein's Toonopedia: The Scarlet Witch |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/scwitch.htm |access-date=2022-09-03 |website=www.toonopedia.com}}</ref> Eric Diaz of ''[[Nerdist]]'' referred to the Scarlet Witch as one of the "comic book medium’s most witchiest witches of all time," saying, "She’s maybe the most famous superhero with the word “Witch” as part of her name. But did you know she wasn’t originally a real witch at all? When she was introduced in 1964’s X-Men #4, as a character who had the mutant power to project “hexes.” Basically, she could make bad stuff happen at random moments. But in the ’70s, Wanda discovered that she could use her powers to tap into Chaos magic, and became a true sorceress. She became powerful enough that she once altered all of reality itself in ''House of M''."<ref>{{Cite web |title=The 9 Witchiest Witches in Comics |url=https://nerdist.com/article/the-9-witchiest-witches-in-comics/ |access-date=2022-09-03 |website=Nerdist |language=en-US}}</ref> Darren Franich of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' stated, "The weird beating heart of the Avengers, the Scarlet Witch has been a hero and a villain, a strongwilled leader and an eternally tormented subject of untold psychological trauma. She can be cosmically powerful, or she can just cast lots of red energy at a problem; she’s a mutant, but she also has magical powers. In stark contrast to her petulant drip of a brother (see No. 63), Wanda’s main problem is that she cares too much. This simple character trait makes her important no matter what the context—she can be a trusty teammate or a half-crazy reality-warping godling. Her powers are ridiculously goofy in theory—”chaos magic”—and it makes sense that ''Age of Ultron'' tries to normalize her special abilities into a recognizable assortment of brain powers. But normalizing Scarlet Witch just makes her a duller Jean Grey. The character is ''supposed'' to be a bit hard to pin down. The Avengers with their own solo titles are constants; they need wild variables like Scarlet Witch."<ref>{{Cite web |last1=April 29 |first1=Darren Franich Updated |last2=EDT |first2=2015 at 12:00 PM |title=Let's rank every Avenger ever |url=https://ew.com/article/2015/04/29/lets-rank-every-avenger-ever/ |access-date=2022-09-03 |website=EW.com |language=en}}</ref> Sara Century of ''[[Syfy]]'' said, "In the years since ''Avengers Disassembled'' and ''House of M'', Wanda Maximoff has been in a state of constant flux. This is a character who was always at a loss to understands her own power, and she’s been working to stabilize since her very first appearance in ''X-Men'' #4 all the way back in 1964. Though Wanda is good-intentioned, more often than not, she ends up a pawn in other people’s schemes. Despite her extraordinary, reality-shifting power, Wanda Maximoff spends most of her time trying to balance the complexities of her own personality. Ever since she whispered “No more mutants” at the end of ''House of M'' and very nearly wiped out the mutant race, she has worked towards a redemptive arc that never quite seems to come. On Krakoa, among the X-Men, she is now known as The Great Pretender, considered to be a traitor, a murderer, and a liar. Yet, as always, Wanda’s story is a lot more complicated than that."<ref>{{Cite web |date=2020-07-29 |title=Wanda Maximoff and the cycle of unrealized redemption |url=https://www.syfy.com/syfy-wire/wanda-maximoff-x-men-scarlet-witch-redemption |access-date=2022-09-03 |website=SYFY Official Site |language=en-US}}</ref>

The sorceress specialises in altering reality and is one of the coolest mutants. In one of the comic book arcs, she rebuilds reality and subverts the status of mutants, creating a world in which mutants are higher in heirarchy than humans.

And this individual has, in the comic books, the power to cause utter devastation. We're not talking about Ultron. Her name is the Scarlet Witch, a.k.a. Wanda Maximoff (played by Elizabeth Olsen). She'll be making her big cinematic debut in AOU, some 51 years after her first appearance in Marvel comic books. That long delay between print and film isn't because Wanda is boring. Indeed, it's the opposite. Her origin is as complex and bizarre as any you'll find at Marvel. She was abandoned at birth and raised, at various points, by a sentient humanoid cow, gypsies, and Magneto, the villainous master of magnetism. Her powers — being able to alter probability and tap into chaos magic — are strange, too, and seemingly difficult to depict in a movie. In fact, there's enough to the Scarlet Witch's story that it could easily fill three Avengers movies."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Abad-Santos |first=Alex |date=2015-04-28 |title=The tragic history of Scarlet Witch, who will make her debut in Avengers: Age of Ultron |url=https://www.vox.com/2015/4/28/8498521/avengers-age-of-ultron-scarlet-witch-explained |access-date=2022-09-03 |website=Vox |language=en}}</ref> 

Jamie Gerber of ''[[The Mary Sue]]'' wrote, "There has long been a great duality within the character—hero and villain, mutant and witch, creator and destroyer—due in no small part to the litany of writers who’ve struggled with which direction to take her in. However, throughout her long journey in comics, she hasn’t had much agency, often being defined by her romantic relationships and manipulated, sidelined, or both. Many comic fans will point to House of M as an important arc for Scarlet Witch, and yet, even there, she was little more than a plot device in the major Marvel event. Calling that series to mind is an understandable impulse, since the truth is that Wanda doesn’t have an overwhelming number of great stories to pull from. Writers have made an effort to rehab the character’s image in the past few years, but Scarlet Witch has long languished in comic book storylines that failed to allow her to live up to her full potential. Meanwhile, on the screen, ''WandaVision'' just wrapped its impressive nine-episode run and has already shown the Marvel Cinematic Universe version of Wanda Maximoff far more compassion than House of M ever did for her comic counterpart."<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-03-18 |title=With WandaVision, the MCU Has Already Been Kinder to Scarlet Witch Than Decades of Comics |url=https://www.themarysue.com/wandavision-scarlet-witch-vs-comics/ |access-date=2022-09-03 |website=The Mary Sue |language=en}}</ref> Andrew McGrotty of ''[[MovieWeb]]'' stated, "Throughout Marvel Comics, The Scarlet Witch has been a key character both as a villain and as an Avenger. Since her first comic book appearance, Wanda Maximoff has had solo adventures and worked with many other heroes to save the world, while also struggling to control the darker side of her abilities. Her unique journey walking the line between light and dark and good and bad has made for some of the most exciting and complex storylines Marvel Comics has had to offer, many of which would be prime stories for the Marvel Cinematic Universe."<ref>{{Cite web |last=McGrotty |first=Andrew |date=2022-05-17 |title=Scarlet Witch: 8 Comic Book Storylines That Need to Be Adapted in the MCU |url=https://movieweb.com/scarlet-witch-comic-book-storylines-adapted-mcu/ |access-date=2022-08-26 |website=MovieWeb |language=en-US}}</ref> Chris Vazquez of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' asserted, "The Scarlet Witch’s popularity skyrocketed after her 2021 solo television series “WandaVision” — especially among LGBTQ fans. In interviews with ''The Washington Post'', many say that Wanda’s experiences with loss, her nontraditional romance (with an android) and her search for family resonate with their journeys. As she returns in Marvel Studios’ “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness” this week, many have hopes and fears about what she’ll face next. [...] Across comics and films, Wanda receives little support from other characters. The MCU portrays her grieving alone, and in the “House of M” comic-book storyline, other characters consider killing Wanda as she experiences a mental health crisis. For Brandon Bush, a comic book journalist, this absence of support also mirrors systemic injustices. “When you see people like Wanda who aren’t getting the resources that they need, you relate to that because you see your own communities and them not getting the resources that they need,” Bush said."<ref>{{Cite news |title=Wanda Maximoff is back.

==== Feminist interpretation ====
Though later incarnations took on feminist overtones, the character of Scarlet Witch was not conceived with ideas of female empowerment in mind. At her debut in the 1960s, the readership for superhero comics was assumed to be mostly male, and the Scarlet Witch was originally seen by some fans and Marvel creators as a token female character with a passive power, used mainly for interpersonal relation plots, perhaps to draw female readers who were believed to prefer [[romance comics]].<ref>Zimmerman, pp. 69-71</ref> ''Avengers'' writer Roy Thomas even created a group of female superheroes, the [[Lady Liberators]], in order to mock [[Second-wave feminism]]. The team is formed by [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Amora the Enchantress]] who uses her magic to influence the women members of the Avengers into turning against their male teammates. Wanda realizes the truth and resists Amora's spell, then defeats her single-handedly. The story's last scene depicts Hank Pym warning that "women's lib" is a ridiculous cause, but Wanda answers back that if sexism continues then the Lady Liberators may rise again. Despite the story mocking feminism, this final scene is now considered an early example of Wanda being a positive feminist character.<ref>Wright, p. 250</ref> In the 1970s, writer [[Steve Englehart]] preferred to make Wanda a more assertive and proactive character who pursued her personal goals and desires. In the 1980s, the first and second ''The Vision and the Scarlet Witch'' limited series both underlined Wanda as a woman who appreciated her time with the Avengers but also wanted to have her own life and agenda independent of the team, purchasing a house with Vision so they could have a relationship and even a family that was entirely their own. Englehart, who enjoyed the marriage of Wanda and Vision and created their children Thomas and William, lamented that later stories annulled the marriage, ended the relationship, removed the children, and repeatedly put Wanda in positions where she became temporarily evil due to emotional trauma and the manipulations of others.<ref name="Steve Englehart" />

==== ''The Vision & The Scarlet Witch'' ====
Max Nason of ''[[CBR.com]]'' wrote, "Easily the most essential read for anyone getting ready for ''WandaVision'' is the two-volume limited series from writers Bill Mantlo (Volume 1) and Steve Englehart (Volume 2) simply titled ''The Vision and the Scarlet Witch''. After their wedding in ''Giant-Size Avengers #4'', these two series help expand and explore the relationship between the two heroes. Both volumes are equally as essential for understanding the characters as individuals as they are for understanding them as a married couple. The series both explore some of Wanda Maximoff's most notable storylines including her relationship with her father as well as her journey into motherhood.

==== ''Avengers Origins: Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver'' ====
According to [[Diamond Comic Distributors]], ''Avengers Origins: Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver'' #1 was the 148th best selling comic book in November 2011.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Comichron: November 2011 Comic Book Sales to Comics Shops |url=https://www.comichron.com/monthlycomicssales/2011/2011-11.html |access-date=2022-09-24 |website=www.comichron.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Top 300 Comics Actual--November 2011 |url=https://icv2.com/articles/comics/view/21712/top-300-comics-actual-november-2011 |access-date=2022-09-24 |website=icv2.com |language=en}}</ref>

Peyton Hinckle of ''[[ComicsVerse]]'' said, "Origin stories make superheroes. They tell us about a character’s motivations, dreams, and memories. They’re the perfect insight into why a character becomes a hero (or a villain). As readers, we need origin stories to understand the heroes we love. For a long time, Scarlet Witch and her brother Quicksilver had a half-formulated backstory. At first, they were just members of Magneto’s brotherhood. But, eventually, they realized that they were also Magneto’s children. The older comics don’t give us an up-close look at Wanda’s childhood, so in 2011 writer Sean McKeever tackled retelling Wanda and Pietro’s story in a modern climate. The result was ''Avengers Origins: Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver'', which finally gave readers the origin story they wanted. If you want to read about Scarlet Witch, but have no idea where to start, this is the issue for you."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Hinckle |first=Peyton |date=December 31, 2018 |title=Marvel's Slice of Chaos Magic: A Scarlet Witch Essential Reading Guide |url=https://comicsverse.com/scarlet-witch-reading-guide/ |website=[[ComicsVerse]]}}</ref> George Marston of ''[[Newsarama]]'' ranked ''Avengers Origins: Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver'' 6th in their "The best Wanda Maximoff / Scarlet Witch stories of all time" list, asserting, "In comic books, Wanda and Pietro's time as villains was short-lived, and their prior history wasn't largely explored until years later, through glimpses and scattered stories. But 2011's ''Avengers Origins: Scarlet Witch & Quicksilver'' takes a deeper dive into the histories of the titular heroes, showing their past and the lead-up to their time with the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants in a way that wasn't previously told on the page. Wanda and Pietro's history is one of the most unlikely backbones of the Marvel Universe, with their simple origins growing from a throughline between the X-Men and Avengers to the saga of a family tree that has branches throughout Marvel Comics, and ''Avengers Origins: Scarlet Witch & Quicksilver'' presents a concise and engaging take on their earliest days."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Marstonpublished |first=George |date=2021-12-22 |title=The best Wanda Maximoff / Scarlet Witch stories of all time |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/scarlet-witch-comics-wanda-maximoff-comic-books/ |access-date=2022-09-03 |website=gamesradar |language=en}}</ref>

Beat Staff of ''[[ComicsVerse]]'' called ''Scarlet Witch'' (vol. 2) #1 "bewitching," saying, "The real gems of the comic are the art of Vanesa Del Rey and the coloring of Jordie Bellaire. The way the lines blend with the color shows the painstaking care that the artist and colorist took. The art is so strong though that I feel much of the heavy, one-sided explanation made through the dialogue could have been done away with. The scenes and the comic as a whole look as if it were a painting, inspired by the colors and style of the early comics (in a good way), but yet with a dash of Dave McKean. Look at an issue of ''Sandman'' by Neil Gaiman and Dave McKean. The dialogue and art flow so well together, but if you took away the text you could still understand what was going on in the story. The art can carry the brunt of the weight if need be. The dialogue is a little heavy in anything Neil Gaiman writes, but heavy in a good way. [...] Overall, I did enjoy Scarlet Witch. The art was refreshing in a market that requires a comic to stand out from the rest. The dialogue was a little tedious, but again it’s a first issue. I would love to see the introduction of other characters to act as catalysts with the Scarlet Witch. If they build on the look of the comic and tune up the text a bit, James Robinson’s Scarlet Witch will do fine."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Staff |first=Beat |date=2015-12-10 |title=Syndicated Comics |url=https://www.comicsbeat.com/james-robinsons-scarlet-witch-1-is-bewitching/ |access-date=2022-09-03 |website=The Beat |language=en-US}}</ref> Chase Magnett of ''[[Comicbook.com]]'' gave ''Scarlet Witch'' (vol. 2) #1 a grade of B, writing, "The beautiful thing about Scarlet Witch (vol. 2) #1 is that it utilizes a long established character with nothing that even resembles an iconic interpretation. Much like the beginning of Matt Fraction and David Aja's run on Hawkeye (a character shown in the very first page of ''Scarlet Witch'' (vol. 2) #1) there's no sacred burial ground that writer James Robinson and artist Vanesa Del Rey must fear treading upon. Instead they are capable of crafting their own mythos and reshaping their main character into the best form for their story. It's something they do well in this first issue, providing an intriguing, if flawed, initial take on this classic Avenger. [...] Scarlet Witch (vol. 2) #1 is a comic with a lot of promise. It's premise and creative team deliver a solid first issue, albeit one that could have used a more challenging editorial hand. Wanda Maximoff's voice has never been stronger though, and as long as the depiction of her adventures remains this compelling, it will be worthwhile seeing where she goes next."<ref>{{Cite web |title=Fastball Feedback: Marvel Edition - Scarlet Witch (vol. 2) #1, Gwenpool #1 |url=https://comicbook.com/news/fastball-feedback-marvel-edition-featuring-scarlet-witch-1/ |access-date=2022-09-03 |website=Comicbook.com |language=en}}</ref> Abhirup Sengupta of ''[[Sportskeeda]]'' called the Scarlet Witch comic book series one of the "5 best comic storylines featuring Scarlet Witch’s true extent of powers," stating, "The comic run featuring one of Wanda Maximoff’s best solo series was written by James Robinson.

===''Age of Apocalypse''===
''[[Age of Apocalypse]]'' was a comic book event where reality was altered by time travel, causing the death of X-Men founder [[Charles Xavier]] ten years before the formation of the [[X-Men]]. This causes a domino effect that leads to the mutant [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] devastating much of the world and ruling the United States' remnants while [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] leads a rebel force that he named the X-Men in honor of his dead friend. In this reality, Magneto finds Wanda and Pietro years earlier and concludes they are his children, allowing him the chance to raise them for part of their lives. Years later, the two are among his first X-Men recruits. While the team is based on Wundagore Mountain in Transia, Wanda welcomes new recruit [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]]. However, the team is attacked by Apocalypse and his troops and Wanda dies fighting Apocalypse's son [[Holocaust (Marvel Comics)|Nemesis]]. As a last request, she asks Rogue to stay close to her father and protect him. Rogue takes the request seriously, eventually entering a romantic relationship with Magneto.<ref>''X-Men Chronicles'' #1 (March 1995)</ref>

===Film===
Marvel licensed the filming rights of the X-Men and related concepts, such as [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]], to [[20th Century Fox]], who created a [[X-Men (film series)|film series]] based on the franchise. Years later, Marvel started their own film franchise, known as the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), which focused on characters that they had not licensed to other studios. The main core of this franchise are the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], both in standalone films and the group's successful [[The Avengers (2012 film)|self-titled film]]. The rights to Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch were at the time disputed by both studios. As they both held the rights to the characters, with Fox citing the characters' mutant status and being children of [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] and Marvel citing the twins' editorial history being more closely tied to the Avengers rather than the X-Men, the studios made an agreement wherein both of them could use the characters on the condition that the plots did not make reference to the other studio's properties (i.e. the Fox films could not mention the twins as members of the Avengers while the MCU could not mention them as mutants or children of Magneto).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/why-quicksilver-is-in-x-men-and-avengers-2015-4|title=Why these two characters are allowed to appear in both the ''X-Men'' and ''Avengers'' movies|first= Kirsten|last= Acuna|website=[[Business Insider]]|date= April 30, 2015|access-date=April 27, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817134937/http://www.businessinsider.com/why-quicksilver-is-in-x-men-and-avengers-2015-4|archive-date= August 17, 2016}}</ref> The arrangement became moot following the [[acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney]] – the parent company of [[Marvel Studios]], and the confirmation that future X-Men films will take place within the MCU.<ref>{{cite web|first=Zack|last=Sharf|date=April 9, 2019 |title=Kevin Feige Says 'It Will Be a Very Long Time' Until the X-Men Join the Marvel Cinematic Universe |url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/04/kevin-feige-long-time-x-men-marvel-cinematic-universe-1202057131/|work=[[IndieWire]]|access-date=September 10, 2020 }}</ref>

The 2014 live-action Fox film ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'' briefly shows [[Peter Maximoff|Quicksilver]] sitting with a small girl who is years younger than him. A deleted scene implies that this girl is his sister and references another unseen sibling. Director [[Bryan Singer]] denied the girl seen in the film is Wanda, saying she is a nameless little sister character who was created to be a nod for comic book fans. Additionally, the film has Quicksilver remark that his father has magnetic abilities, but does not confirm that this is Magneto or clarify whether Quicksilver's other siblings share the same father.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/new/X-Men-Days-Future-Past-Cuts-All-Mentions-Scarlet-Witch-42762.html|title=''X-Men: Days Of Future Past'' Cuts All Mentions Of Scarlet Witch|first= Gabe|last= Toro|publisher= Cinema Blend|date=April 28, 2014|access-date= October 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222142319/http://www.cinemablend.com/new/X-Men-Days-Future-Past-Cuts-All-Mentions-Scarlet-Witch-42762.html|archive-date= December 22, 2015}}</ref> In the sequel film ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'', Quicksilver is confirmed to be Magneto's son and has a half-sister, Nina, who Magneto raised in Europe.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/x-men-apocalypse-magneto-daughter-2016-6?international=true&r=US&IR=T|title= The most tragic scene in 'X-Men: Apocalypse' has an even sadder comic history|last=Fussell|first=Sidney|website=[[Business Insider]]|date=June 1, 2016|access-date=June 16, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190618172401/https://www.businessinsider.com/x-men-apocalypse-magneto-daughter-2016-6?international=true&r=US&IR=T|archive-date=June 18, 2019}}</ref>
