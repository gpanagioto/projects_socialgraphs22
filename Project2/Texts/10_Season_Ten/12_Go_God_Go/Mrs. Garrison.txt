Principal Victoria, it is wrong!  Evolution is a theory! A hare-brained theory that says I'm a monkey! I am not a monkey!! I'm a woman! I warn you, Principal Victoria! Those students are not prepared to hear this stuff! All right kids, it is now my job to teach you the theory of evolution. Now I, for one, think evolution is a bunch of BULL CRAP.  So there you go! You're the retarded offspring of five monkeys having butt sex with a fish-squirrel! Congratulations! Yeah? You see? I ''knew'' that would happen. Whatever.  Retarded fish-frogs. Well, you're a faggot!  Continue. So you ''are'' saying that we're all related to monkeys. Do you see monkeys at the zoo?! They crap in their hands and throw it at people! What about the fact that if I believe in this crap, you're gonna go to hell?! Doesn't that bother you a little?  AHA! I've got you, you snake in the grass!! I found you out!! And if I'm a monkey, then I might as well ''act'' like a monkey, huh?!  Don't ask me, I'm a fuckin' monkey!!  Principal Victoria, I was simply trying to make a point to Mr. Dawkins about the incongruity of some scientific statements. What?? What?!  You d-you do? Well I...  No! N-no! My, my husband is g-gone, ''dead''. Well,  I've got a date! I've got a date! My first real date with a real man since my sex-change operation!  Hey everybody! So I told my gynecologist, "you put so many things in my vagina, maybe I should charge you!"  Hehyeah, almost. Well... Well, you know, I'm... I'm open to stuff. Oh I'm not... I'm not ''totally'' into the whole God thing. I just... I just think, you know, you can't disprove God.  Hey everyone, I'm an atheist! No, I totally get it now! Evolution explains everything! There is no great mystery to life, just evolution and God's a spaghetti monster! Thank you, Richard! Would you like tuh...  head over to my place for dessert? Oh yeah! Yeah, I'm a monkey! Give this monkey what she wants! Yeah, pound my monkey hole, Richard! Yeah, I'm a monkey all right! ''[thinking] That's my man.'' That's right, kids. And so you see, there is no God. What?!  Do you believe in a flying spaghetti monster too, bubblehead?! Come on, you. You're gonna have to sit in the dunce chair!  What?? But Dick, you told me the world would be a better place without religion.  You've just been too soft on religious people in the past. Think about it, Richard. With your intellect and my balls, we can change the future of the world. You're the smartest man on earth, Dick. With me by your side, there's no stopping you. Oh, all right.  OHOH YEAH!! AHHH!!
