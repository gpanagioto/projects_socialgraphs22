 Looks like we had some attempted escapees again tonight.  There ''is'' no escape.  All beddy-byes for the night, are they? We'll just have to give them more time. They'll do it! They'll do it!!  Please, Mr. Sanders.  Horace's parents want to take him home. Please, sir, if you give us one more week,... We're in trouble, Rick. Good-bye, Alice. Oh no, not you. You're not welcome here anymore.
