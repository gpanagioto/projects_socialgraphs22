'''Dracula''' is a [[fiction]]al [[Character (arts)|character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He is based on the [[vampire]] [[Count Dracula]] from the novel of the [[Dracula|same name]] by author [[Bram Stoker]]. After the initial run of the series ''[[The Tomb of Dracula]]'', the character has been depicted primarily as an antagonist to [[superhero]]es in the [[Marvel Universe]].

The character appeared in the film ''[[Blade: Trinity]]'' (2004), primarily portrayed by [[Dominic Purcell]] in his normal form and [[Brian Steele]] in his "Beast" form.

The Marvel Comics version of Dracula was created by [[Gerry Conway]] and [[Gene Colan]] in ''[[The Tomb of Dracula]]'' #1 (April 1972), co-written by [[Marv Wolfman]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=116}}</ref> A different version of Dracula had previously appeared in the [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]] publication, ''Suspense'' #7 (Mar. 1951). Traditionally, the [[Comics Code Authority]] prevented Marvel from publishing vampire comics. This was revised in early 1971, when comics were allowed to publish characters and beings from established literary works. Later that year, [[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Morbius the Living Vampire]] appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' for the first time, and Dracula followed in his own title some months later.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cbldf.org/comics-code-revision-of-1971/|title=Comics Code Revision of 1971 &#124; Comic Book Legal Defense Fund}}</ref> The character starred in the comic, which ended with issue #70 in 1979. This version of Dracula also starred in ''[[Dracula Lives!]]'', a black-and-white horror comic magazine series published by Marvel from 1973 to 1975. Running concurrently with ''[[The Tomb of Dracula]]'', the continuities of the two titles occasionally overlapped, with storylines weaving between the two.

''[[The Tomb of Dracula]]'' initially kept its distance from the rest of the company's properties. Marv Wolfman said, "To me, the horror books were outside the Marvel Universe. It was a hard enough problem creating mood, tension, and suspense in a comic book, which is all still pictures. But to then have to worry about superheroes or supervillains at the same time — I didn't feel that would work." But the potential for a sales-boosting crossover eventually became too tempting, and Dracula appeared in the first issue of ''Giant-Size Spider-Man'' (July 1974).<ref name=universe>{{cite journal |last1=Greenberg |first1=Glenn |title=Dracula vs. the Marvel Universe |journal=Back Issue |date=October 2019 |issue=116 |pages=43–44}}</ref>

Although Dracula (and all other [[Vampire (Marvel Comics)|vampires]]) were eventually destroyed by the mystical "Montesi Formula" in the pages of ''[[Doctor Strange]]'', the vampire lord was revived. Marvel published a four-issue ''Tomb of Dracula'' [[miniseries]], reuniting Wolfman and Colan, under its [[Epic Comics]] imprint in 1991, and revived Dracula and his foes in the short-lived ''[[Nightstalkers (comics)|Nightstalkers]]'' and ''[[Blade (comics)|Blade]]'' series in the 1990s. Most recently, Dracula took the title role in the miniseries ''Dracula: Lord of the Undead''.

''[[X-Men: Apocalypse vs. Dracula]]'' featured Dracula battling the [[X-Men]]'s greatest foe, [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]], in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] London.

The character returns in the ''[[Captain Britain and MI13]]'' storyline "Vampire State",<ref>Appearing first at the end of the previous arc ''Captain Britain and MI13'' #9{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}</ref> with [[Doctor Doom]].<ref name=cbr19645>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=19645 Bloody Hell: Cornell on Captain Britain], [[Comic Book Resources]], January 21, 2009</ref><ref name=newsarama020911>[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/020911-Nine-Cornella.html Newsarama 9: Paul Cornell], [[Newsarama]], February 11, 2009</ref>

He was the main subject of the 2010 X-Men storyline "[[Curse of the Mutants]]", written by [[Victor Gischler]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Nomad |url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/37386/the-x-men-get-all-fanged-up-the-curse-mutants |title=The X-Men Get All Fanged Up in Curse of the Mutants |publisher=[[DreadCentral]] |date=May 6, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicmonsters.com/features-1120-Victor_Gischler_talks_DEATH_OF_DRACULA_and_X-MEN.html |title=Victor Gischler talks DEATH OF DRACULA and X-MEN |publisher=Comic Monsters |date=May 12, 2010 |access-date=May 26, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Dave |last=Richards |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=26302 |title=Victor Gischler Plots "The Death of Dracula" |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=May 19, 2010 |access-date=May 26, 2010 }}</ref> By this time, Dracula no longer adopts the dress and mannerisms of a [[Victorian era]] [[nobleman]], rather his appearance is more reminiscent of a medieval warlord. He wears a form of body armor and a cape with ragged ends. He has long blonde hair maintained in a ponytail and inhuman features such as red eyes, elongated canines, and retractable claws at the tips of his fingers and pointed ears.

== Fictional character biography ==
{{In-universe|section|date=December 2010}}

=== Historical ===
Born '''Vlad Dracula''' in 1430 in [[Schassburg]], [[Transylvania]] (now [[Sighişoara]], Romania), he was the second son of a Transylvanian nobleman. He was named prince of Transylvania and voivode (prince) of [[Wallachia]] and became ruler while still a child. Over the next several years, he struggled against the [[Ottoman Turks]], losing and regaining his throne. Through an arranged marriage to a Hungarian noblewoman, Zofia, he sired his daughter, [[Lilith (Marvel Comics)#Dracula's daughter|Lilith]]. He sent his wife and daughter away and later married a woman named Maria, with whom he had a son named Vlad Tepelus. He had a son with his third wife Domini, who was named [[Janus (Marvel Comics)|Janus]].

In 1459, Dracula was mortally wounded by the Turkish warlord [[Turac]], who brought Dracula to a [[Romani people|gypsy]] named [[Lianda (comics)|Lianda]] to be healed. However, Lianda was a [[Vampire (Marvel Comics)|vampire]], and in revenge for his persecution of the gypsies, transformed Dracula into a vampire as well. Turac raped and killed Dracula's wife Maria, and in revenge Dracula slew Turac, making him a vampire as well. Dracula gave his son Vlad Tepelus to gypsies to raise.<ref name="DraculaLives1">''Dracula Lives!'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Dracula defeated the vampire [[Nimrod (vampire)|Nimrod the First]] in battle, and thus succeeded him as ruler of Earth's vampires.<ref name="DraculaLives1" /> Soon afterwards, he enhanced his own blood with that of [[Varnae]], giving him greater powers than any other vampire. In 1471, Dracula abdicated his princehood.

In the 19th century, he faced opposition from [[Abraham Van Helsing|Abraham van Helsing]] and [[Jonathan Harker]] in England, the exploits of which were recorded in the 1897 novel by [[Bram Stoker]], ''[[Dracula]]''. When the humans destroyed Dracula, his remains were placed in his coffin, concealed within a cave blocked by an enormous boulder. [[Frankenstein's Monster (Marvel Comics)|Frankenstein's Monster]] was later tricked into unsealing the cave and opening the coffin, thus freeing Dracula.<ref>''The Frankenstein Monster'' #7–8. Marvel Comics.</ref> In later years, he also came in conflict with Cagliostro and [[Solomon Kane (comics)|Solomon Kane]].<ref name="DraculaLives1" /> Just before World War I, he was responsible for transforming Lord John Falsworth into [[Baron Blood]].<ref>''The Invaders'' #7-9 (July-Oct. 1976) and ''Captain America'' #253-254 (Jan.-Feb. 1981). Marvel Comics.</ref>

=== ''The Tomb of Dracula'' ===
In the later half of the 20th century, Dracula was once more returned from death by Clifton Graves, and subsequently came into conflict with [[Quincy Harker]]<ref>''Tomb of Dracula'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref> and [[Rachel van Helsing]],<ref>''Tomb of Dracula'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''The Defenders'' #95. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After bringing the [[Darkhold|Cult of the Darkhold]] under his control, Dracula began to seek the power of the dark book to remove his vampiric weaknesses and make himself truly immortal. However, in his quest he was repeatedly foiled by the [[X-Men]], the now-vampiric Rachel van Helsing and Lilith,<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' Annual #6. Marvel Comics.</ref> [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]],<ref>''Thor'' #332–333. Marvel Comics.</ref> Doctor Strange, Hannibal King and the [[The Avengers (comic book)|Avengers]].<ref>''Doctor Strange'' #60. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Dracula had one apparent post-mortem appearance when the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]] summoned him and [[Legion of the Unliving|a number of other deceased heroes and villains]] to challenge the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #2 and ''The Avengers'' Annual #16. Marvel Comics.</ref>

=== Dracula's return (1994 – present) ===
Dracula eventually returned when the effect of the Montesi Formula was negated and [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]] created a clone from Dracula's DNA to serve as their vampiric superweapon, only for the vampire to escape their control.<ref>''Nightstalkers'' #16–18. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In the 21st century, Dracula assembled an army of vampires in a sanctuary on the [[Moon]] and planned to conquer the United Kingdom,<ref>''Captain Britain and MI-13'' #9. Marvel Comics.</ref> with other supernatural villains [[Lilith (Marvel Comics)#Mother of All Demons|Lilith]] (a different entity from his daughter), [[Captain Fate]], and [[Baron Blood]]. He first contacted [[Doctor Doom]] to agree to a [[non-aggression pact]] with him, and by association the [[Illuminati (comics)#The Cabal|Cabal]], in order to be unopposed in his conquest. Once he'd secured this, he launched a pre-emptive strike on [[MI-13 (comics)|MI-13]]'s superheroes, launching specially-bred vampires at the Earth like missiles.

It was also shown he still possessed contempt and bigotry towards Muslims, and intended to exterminate them once he had secured Great Britain; as part of his attack, he went to the parents of [[Faiza Hussain]],<ref>''Captain Britain and MI-13'' #10. Marvel Comics.</ref> attacking her mother and taking her father (along with [[Killpower]], an MI-13 agent sent to protect the family) hostage.<ref>''Captain Britain and MI-13'' #11. Marvel Comics.</ref> British vampire hero [[Spitfire (comics)|Spitfire]], meanwhile, was abducted and forcibly turned into a minion. MI-13 were manipulated into exposing the whereabouts of Quincy Harker's remains, magically treated to prevent vampires from entering the U.K. without invitation, so Dracula could destroy them. Once that was done, with the help of Fate, he launched a series of warships towards Earth.{{Issue|date=August 2009}}

However, unknown to Dracula, [[Pete Wisdom]] had tricked him into destroying fake remains and Spitfire had been faking her mind control while channeling information to MI-13. In order to stop Dracula from finding out the remains were fake, he was briefly trapped in a demonic "Dream Corridor" which saw him live out his fantasies of victory (ending with him standing in a conquered [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] while holding the Speaker's mace); as well as giving MI-13 some intelligence on his plans, it stopped him from sending in advance teams. Once he escaped, there were a series of attacks to keep him occupied until the warships entered British airspace without invitation, wiping out the bulk of his forces.{{Issue|date=August 2009}}

In the final battle, he was pursued to his fortress and prevented from escaping by the [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]] and Faiza Hussain, wielder of the sword [[Excalibur]]. While Dracula was able to seriously wound the Black Knight, he was slain with a single blow from Excalibur, leaving Britain victorious.<ref>''Captain Britain and MI 13'' #13–15. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In a 2010 ''[[X-Men (vol. 3)|X-Men]]'' storyline "[[Curse of the Mutants]]", Dracula has been killed by his son Xarus, but is resurrected by the X-Men in hopes that he would join them against Xarus. However, Dracula declines and leaves shortly after.<ref>Gischler, Victor. ''X-Men'' vol. 3 #3 (Nov. 2010). Marvel Comics.</ref> Dracula reasserts himself as Lord of the Vampires, granting amnesty to those who sided with Xarus. When Xarus tries to attack Dracula, he rips off Xarus' head. Although he contemplated attacking the X-Men, [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] reminded him that they had had custody of his body for 17 hours before the head was reattached, suggesting that they had included a 'contingency plan' in Dracula similar to the plan that they had used to infiltrate Xarus' forces by temporarily shutting down [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]'s healing factor so that he could be turned and then returned to normal. Although Dracula suspected that Cyclops was bluffing, he complimented Cyclops's style and allowed them to depart, even returning the now-vampire [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]] to the X-Men.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 3 #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]" storyline, Dracula is informed of the arrival of the [[Hulk]] (in the form of Nul: Breaker of Worlds) by one of his followers when Nul lands in the Carpathian foothills following his fight with Thor and ends up taking down some vampires. It is revealed that he has the mysterious Raizo Kodo and his legion of vampires called "the Forgiven" locked up in his dungeon.<ref>''Fear Itself: Hulk vs. Dracula'' #1</ref> Dracula frees the Forgiven, who worked to slow Nul's progress. Dracula then prepares the vampires for his last stand.<ref>''Fear Itself: Hulk vs. Dracula'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> As the Forgiven continue to stall Nul, Dracula prepares his vampire armies for battle when Nul gets closer. In the end, Nul is defeated when Inka uses a vampire-mesmerizing spell to take the form of Betty Ross, causing the Hulk to break free of the hammer's magic and revert to normal.<ref>''Fear Itself: Hulk vs. Dracula'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In "Dracula's Gauntlet", Dracula hired Deadpool to retrieve his fiancé, a succubus queen named [[Shiklah]]. On the way, she falls in love with him instead and, during the extended trip, her brothers are killed by Dracula to secure the kingdom of Monster Metropolis as his own. This causes Shiklah to deny him the throne by marrying Deadpool, driving Dracula into a rage not because of the power and kingdom he lost, but because he was cuckolded by "an escaped mental patient". After a fight in which he is stabbed with Deadpool's severed hand, poisoned by the mercenary's blood and his army mostly wiped out, Dracula flees into hiding, leaving Shiklah as Queen of the Monsters.{{issue|date=March 2017}}

Possibly a little over a year later, there is trouble in his ex-fiancé's marriage. Shiklah has had enough of the humans and started a war to annex New York. Deadpool comes to Dracula for help in stopping her, threatening him with a wooden stake. Dracula cannot remember Shiklah's name at first, until Deadpool angrily reminds him. He states that he hates Deadpool, who replies that Dracula hates himself more, which actually makes him Shiklah's type. Once they return to New York, Dracula is able to gain control of the vampires in Shiklah's army to fight against her monsters. However, the second he meets Shiklah, he proposes to her&nbsp;— wanting to merge their kingdoms and rule with the humans at their feet. Deadpool angrily curses Dracula. Dracula and Shiklah are married by Mephisto, while an angry Deadpool and a confused Spider-Man are tied up and made to watch. Dracula and Shiklah share a kiss, and she thanks him for giving her the wedding she always wanted&nbsp;— with chaos and fire burning.<ref>''Deadpool and the Mercs for Money'' #10. Marvel Comics.</ref>

They head off to tell their followers of their union. However, Shiklah's monsters tell her that they do not wish to be ruled by a monarch any longer. Shiklah is shocked that her subjects want her run off, and Deadpool shows up to tell her that she cannot marry Dracula. He argues that the entire reason they married was because he was saving her from Dracula, reminding her that Dracula killed her brothers. Shiklah shrugs it off, and tells Deadpool that he would have done the same if he knew them. She then attacks him, telling him that he cannot tell her who she can impetuously marry. After one last tryst and talk with Deadpool, Shiklah emerges and tells Dracula to let their subjects rule themselves, stating that she does not want to rule by force. Dracula eventually relents, stating that he was retired anyway before Deadpool dragged him into this fight. He leaves with Shiklah, who wants to see more of the world. Shiklah wrote Deadpool a note, stating she was off for some stake-play with Dracula.<ref>''Deadpool'' vol. 4 #29. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Dracula returns to his castle in Romania without Shiklah, and somehow begins summoning all vampires in the world to him, including [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]]. [[Old Man Logan]] tracks Jubilee to Dracula's castle, where it is revealed that she is under the vampire's control. Dracula bites Old Man Logan, but his healing factor is able to resist vampirism. Jubilee eventually breaks free from Dracula's influence, allowing Old Man Logan to decapitate Dracula. Dracula's head is given to a Sentinel that then throws it into the Sun.<ref>''Old Man Logan'' #14–15. Marvel Comics.</ref>

== Powers and abilities ==
[[File:Rachel van Helsing.jpg|thumb|250px|Dracula attempting to vampirize [[Rachel van Helsing]], from ''[[The Tomb of Dracula]]'' (vol. 1) #40 (Jan. 1986). Art by [[Gene Colan]] and [[Tom Palmer (comics)|Tom Palmer]].]]

Dracula gained the powers of a vampire from his transformation into a vampire by the bite of the vampiress [[Lianda (comics)|Lianda]], and gained additional power by [[Varnae]]. Dracula possesses far greater powers than most vampires. He is [[Superhuman strength|superhumanly strong]] (to the point of standing toe-to-toe and defeating [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] in single combat), and also possesses superhuman speed, stamina, reflexes, and [[Transvection (flying)|transvection]]. He is [[Immortality|immune to aging]], conventional disease, sickness and most forms of injury. He cannot be killed or permanently injured by conventional means.

He is unaffected by most assaults and, due to his healing factor, can rapidly [[Regeneration (biology)|regenerate damaged tissue]]. Dracula can [[Mind control|manipulate the minds of others]], and command animals, such as rats, bats, and wolves, to his will. With limited exceptions, he may control other vampires. He has the ability to mentally control victims he has bitten, and can temporarily [[Hypnosis|hypnotize]] anyone with his gaze.

He is capable of [[shapeshifting]] into a bat&nbsp;– either normal or human size&nbsp;– or a wolf while retaining his intelligence and into a [[fog]] or [[mist]]&nbsp;– partially or fully&nbsp;– and has the ability of [[weather control]], such as summoning [[Thunderstorm|electrical storms]]. Like some vampires in other works of fiction, Dracula does not cast a reflection in mirrors and his image cannot be captured on film. His powers have been greatly amplified and his weaknesses circumvented by magical sources, such as the spells of the Darkholders.

Dracula has a dependence on the ingestion of fresh blood to sustain his existence, and an inability to endure direct sunlight. He falls into a comatose state during daylight hours and must spend much time in contact with his native soil. He has vulnerabilities to garlic (which can both repel him and prevent him from changing form), silver and wood (both of which can cause severe pain, the latter to a lesser extent unless it penetrates his heart) and the presence of religious symbols (wielded by one who believes in their spiritual meaning), and can be killed either by beheading or by a wooden stake or blade made of silver driven through his heart. He can also be destroyed by the spell in the Darkhold known as the Montesi Formula (named after Brother Montesi, the late monk who both discovered it and first realized what it was).

Dracula is a skilled hand-to-hand combatant and swordsman with centuries of experience, specializing in 15th-century warfare and militaristic strategy. He has a gifted [[intellect]], and studied under tutors in his youth in Transylvania.

Though the character has little resemblance to the comic book version, this version is the original progenitor of "''Hominus Nocturna''" and has gone by many names, currently assuming the name '''[[Frank Drake (comics)|Drake]]'''{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}. Drake was "born" as the "perfect" vampire, though his true origins are unknown. He is also capable of limited shapeshifting due to a particularly malleable bone structure, which allows him to assume the appearance of others so long as they are of similar size and shape to him and transform into a demonic form called "the Beast", and possesses perfect immunity to sunlight. After spending three centuries in self-imposed exile, Drake is brought back by modern vampires led by Danica Talos in the hope that he will allow them to free them of their weakness to sunlight. However, [[Blade (New Line Blade franchise character)|Blade]] and Abigail Whistler kill Drake with a "plague arrow" that combines with the vampire's "pure" vampire blood to release an airborne contagion capable of destroying all vampires in the world. Out of respect for Blade's victory over him, Drake transforms himself into a duplicate of the former so Blade can escape police manhunt. In an extended ending, Drake awakes in Blade's form and attacks the police.
