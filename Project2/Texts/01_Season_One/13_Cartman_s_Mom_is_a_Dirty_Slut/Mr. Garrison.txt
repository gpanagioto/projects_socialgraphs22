Well, I guess we should go, Mr. Hat. Mr. Hat, you need to admit you have a drinking problem!  Another Cosmo, please. What the hell are you talking about, Eric?  Oh. I am not gay! No! Okay, Okay! I admit it! I might have made love to your mother at the Drunken Barn Dance! But who here didn't?! Now come on, honestly. Who here has never had sex with Mrs. Cartman? ...You don't count, Halfy-you don't have any legs! So you see, Eric, anyone here could be your father. I'm afraid you're never going to know.  Yes! For God's sake, get on with it! You go to hell! You go to hell and you die!
