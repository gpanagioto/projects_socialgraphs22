'''Omega the Unknown''' is  an [[American comic book]] published by [[Marvel Comics]] from 1976 to 1977, featuring  the eponymous fictional character.  The series, written by [[Steve Gerber]] and [[Mary Skrenes]] and illustrated by [[Jim Mooney]], ran for 10 issues before cancellation for low sales. Despite its short run, it has remained as a [[cult classic]] due to its intriguing characters and unusual storytelling. A 10-issue series revamping the character was published from 2007 to 2008, written by novelist [[Jonathan Lethem]] and illustrated by [[Farel Dalrymple]].

==Creation and concept==
Unlike many other [[superhero]] titles, the main focus of ''Omega the Unknown'' is not on the superpowered person in an iconic costume and cape. Instead the story largely deals with an unusually mature 12-year-old boy named James-Michael Starling.<ref>{{cite book|last = Sanderson|first = Peter|author-link = Peter Sanderson|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1970s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher= [[Dorling Kindersley]]|date = 2008|location= London, United Kingdom|page = 175|isbn =978-0756641238|quote= In March [1976], a new super hero series began called ''Omega the Unknown'', created by writers Steve Gerber and Mary Skrenes and artist Jim Mooney.

Interviewed in 2005 after the sequel was announced, co-creator [[Steve Gerber]] stated that he "wanted to do a series about a real kid who was nobody's sidekick, facing real problems in what today would be called a 'grim 'n gritty' setting."<ref name="omeg"/> The series was cancelled in 1977, but Steve Gerber promised to wrap up its unfinished plotlines in ''[[The Defenders (comic book)|The Defenders]]''.<ref name="Grant on Gerber">{{cite web|last=Grant|first=Steven|author-link= Steven Grant|title=Permanent Damage|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=15768|date= February 13, 2008|website= Comic Book Resources|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140117010446/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=15768|archive-date= January 17, 2014|url-status= live|df=mdy-all|access-date=May 2, 2013}}</ref> Gerber was fired by Marvel Comics in 1978<ref>{{cite journal|title = Marvel Fires Gerber|journal = [[The Comics Journal]]|issue = #41|page = 7|publisher = [[Fantagraphics Books]]|date = August 1978|location= Stamford, Connecticut<!--location in 1978-->}}</ref> and never completed the storyline.

In late 1978, [[Al Milgrom]], the editor of ''The Defenders'', assigned writer [[Steven Grant]] to complete the story, the conclusion of which was still being sought after in fan correspondence.<ref name="Grant on Gerber"/> Grant did this in two issues of ''The Defenders'' in 1979,<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Grant, Steven|penciller= [[Herb Trimpe|Trimpe, Herb]]|inker= Steve Mitchell|story= Little Triggers!|title= Defenders|issue= #76|date= October 1979}}</ref><ref name="Defenders77">{{cite comic| writer= Grant, Steven; [[Mark Gruenwald|Gruenwald, Mark]]|penciller= Trimpe, Herb|inker= [[Al Milgrom|Milgrom, Al]]; [[Chic Stone|Stone, Chic]]; Mitchell, Steve|story= Waiting for the End of the World!|title= Defenders|issue= #77|date= November 1979}}</ref> at the end of which most of the original series' characters were killed.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.toonopedia.com/omega.htm|title= Omega the Unknown|first= Don|last= Markstein|year= 2007|website= [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]]|archive-url= https://www.webcitation.org/6Twr2jcVu?url=http://www.toonopedia.com/omega.htm|archive-date= November 9, 2014|url-status= live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> While Gerber seemed unhappy with Grant's conclusion,<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.stevegerber.com/sgblog/?p=77|title= The ''Omega'' Flap|access-date= December 23, 2006|last= Gerber|first= Steve|author-link= Steve Gerber|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110716135611/http://www.stevegerber.com/sgblog/?p=77|archive-date= July 16, 2011|url-status= dead|df= mdy-all|date= June 14, 2005}}</ref> it nevertheless tied up the loose ends of the comic series, and is considered "canon" by Marvel.<ref name="Sanderson190">Sanderson "1970s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 190: "Writer Steven Grant devised this wrap-up of the Omega story line, killing off the other protagonist, James-Michael Starling.

==Plot synopsis==
In the premiere issue, the character of Omega is shown as the last surviving member of an unnamed [[List of alien races in Marvel Comics|alien race]].  He escapes the mechanical beings who have devastated his planet in a ship headed to Earth.  The story then cuts to James-Michael waking up in bed having dreamed the events that just occurred with Omega.

In his waking world, James-Michael and his parents are moving to New York City from the mountains so he can improve his socialization skills after years of home-schooling.  En route to New York the Starlings' car is driven off the road and both of James-Michael's parents are killed, but not before the boy discovers that both of them were [[robot]]s. James-Michael collapses into a coma and awakens a month later in a private hospital exhibiting an eerie lack of emotional response to his parents' deaths.  The hospital is later attacked by one of the mechanical beings that destroyed Omega's home world, and Omega himself appears to defend James-Michael.  The superhero and the android fight but the conflict ends when James-Michael himself destroys the alien mechanism with energy bursts from his hands (an effect used by Omega in James-Michael's dreams).

After this beginning, the story follows James-Michael's life as he is fostered to two young women in the [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] neighborhood of New York City.  The series explores the problems he encounters in a strange new place, and his trials and friendships in a New York City public school. Issues of racism and bullying are addressed, although the stories' focus is on how the reserved and detached James-Michael relates to the world around him.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2006/08/05/trapped-in-a-%20friday-he-never-made/|title=Trapped In A Friday He Never Made! |access-date= December 23, 2006|last=Hatcher|first=Greg|website= Comic Book Resources|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110719014745/http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2006/08/05/trapped-in-a-%20friday-he-never-made/|archive-date=July 19, 2011|url-status= dead|df=mdy-all|date= August 5, 2006}}</ref>

Meanwhile, Omega the Unknown becomes a superhero figure in New York City, tending to fight only second-string supervillains (though he did once confront the [[Hulk]])<ref name="Omega2">{{cite comic| writer= Gerber, Steve; [[Mary Skrenes|Skrenes, Mary]]|penciller= [[Jim Mooney|Mooney, Jim]]|inker= Mooney, Jim|story= Welcome to Hell's Kitchen!|title= Omega the Unknown|issue= #2|date= May 1976}}</ref> with a variety of outcomes. Otherwise, Omega tends to appear when James-Michael is in danger and then takes a more proactive role.  As the series progresses Omega and James-Michael eventually meet and interact, although the nature of their relationship remains unclear. Omega himself is killed in the 10th and final issue, leaving the mysteries of the story unresolved.

==Fictional character biography==
Omega the Unknown is a humanoid being of superhuman power bio-engineered by an extraterrestrial mechanoid race named the Protar, from the planet Protaris in the Regreb System in the Milky Way Galaxy.  The Protar, foreseeing their own extinction, decided to create an ideal race of true humanoids as their legacy to the cosmos.  Their penultimate model, later called Omega, was placed on the planet Srenesk (an anagram of series co-writer [Mary] "Skrenes") to learn. He commandeered a Protar starship and fled to Earth after inadvertently destroying the world on which he was placed.  The Earth was the home of the final "model" in his series, the artificially created boy James-Michael Starling, whom Omega sought to protect from the Protar.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Gerber, Steve; Skrenes, Mary|penciller= Mooney, Jim|inker= Mooney, Jim|story= Omega the Unknown|title= Omega the Unknown|issue= #1|date= March 1976}}</ref>

While on Earth, Omega was employed for odd jobs by a New York City pawn-broker, and had a number of battles with local beings. He battled the [[Hulk]],<ref name="Omega2" /> [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]],<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Gerber, Steve; Skrenes, Mary|penciller= Mooney, Jim|inker= Mooney, Jim|story= Burn While You Learn!|title= Omega the Unknown|issue= #3|date= July 1976}}</ref> the [[Blockbuster (Man-Brute)|Blockbuster]],<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Scott Edelman|Edelman, Scott]]|penciller= Mooney, Jim|inker= Mooney, Jim|story= Blockbuster!|title= Omega the Unknown|issue= #7|date= March 1977}}</ref> and [[Nitro (comics)|Nitro]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Roger Stern|Stern, Roger]]|penciller= [[Lee Elias|Elias, Lee]]|inker= Mooney, Jim|story= A Blast From the Past|title= Omega the Unknown|issue= #8|date= May 1977}}</ref> While later embroiled in a rematch with Blockbuster, the second [[Foolkiller#Greg Salinger|Foolkiller]] saved Omega's life by murdering Blockbuster.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Gerber, Steve; Skrenes, Mary|penciller= Mooney, Jim|inker= Mooney, Jim|story= Fightin' Fools!|title= Omega the Unknown|issue= #9|date= July 1977}}</ref>

Omega was finally shot dead in Las Vegas by the Las Vegas Police while battling [[Ruby Thursday]]; the police thought Omega was assaulting Ruby.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Gerber, Steve; Skrenes, Mary|penciller= Mooney, Jim|inker= Mooney, Jim|story= The Hottest Slot in Town!|title= Omega the Unknown|issue= #10|date= October 1977}}</ref> James-Michael Starling, who had inherited Omega's power, learned the true origin of himself and Omega but refused to accept the truth. He threatened to use the power of Earth's biosphere against the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]. Seeing the error of his decision, he ended his own life when he turned the power inward and self-destructed.<ref name="Defenders77" /><ref name="Sanderson190" />

In the series ''The Darkhold Omega'' it was revealed that James-Michael Starling was lost in the dimension called Other-Realm, and that the original Omega had died.  In that dimension James battled the demonic entity, [[List of Marvel Comics characters: C#Chthon|Chthon]], before being returned to earth by the [[Scarlet Witch]]. Afterward he is seen to have taken on the costume and title of Omega, and was living in rural Pennsylvania where his "mother", a floating robotic head, vowed to take care of him.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Darkhold Omega #1|publisher=Marvel Comics|year=2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://screenrant.com/marvel-hero-returns-omega-unknown-darkhold/|title= Marvel's Darkhold Event Reveals Surprise Return of a Long Lost Hero|first= Liam|last= McGuire|year= 2022|website= [[Screenrant]]}}</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Omega was created through Protarian technology, and has superhuman strength. He has limited psychokinetic abilities, and has a psionic rapport with other Protarian organic creations.

Omega was educated as a warrior on the planet Srenesk, trained in the fighting skills of a Srenesk warrior. The extraterrestrial Sreneskian endowed him with the ability to draw upon the psionic energy of the biosphere to project energy bolts from his hands and fly. Using biospheric energy beyond a certain level could result in global destruction.

==Reception==
In 2010, [[Comics Bulletin]] ranked Gerber and Mooney's run on ''Omega the Unknown'' tenth on its list of the "Top 10 1970s Marvels".<ref>{{cite web |url= http://comicsbulletin.com/top-10-1970s-marvels/|title= Top 10 1970s Marvels|first= Jason|last= Sacks|date= September 6, 2010|website= [[Comics Bulletin]]|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130801070005/http://www.comicsbulletin.com/columns/447/top-10-1970s-marvels|archive-date= August 1, 2013|url-status= live|df=mdy-all|access-date= August 3, 2013}}</ref>

[[Comic Book Resources]] placed Omega the Unknown as one of "15 Superheroes Marvel Wants You To Forget", stating "his complicated history makes it exceedingly unlikely that he'll return to the Marvel universe."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbr.com/superheroes-marvel-wants-you-to-forget/|title= 15 Superheroes Marvel Wants You To Forget|first= Gary|last= Smith|date= August 20, 2017|website= Comic Book Resources|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170902093045/http://www.cbr.com/superheroes-marvel-wants-you-to-forget/|archive-date= September 2, 2017|url-status= live|df= mdy-all}}</ref>

{{quote|When Marvel invited me into their vault of iconography, I simply leapt at the icon that resonated most deeply with me.  It didn't hurt that Omega had been laying in neglect for so long, I might have had trouble trying to utilize a character who'd been put through so many paces as [[Spider-Man]] or [[Hulk|the Hulk]], say.

After hearing of Lethem's plans to revive Omega, the character's co-creator Steve Gerber expressed personal outrage over the use of the character without his participation, though he and Mary Skrenes later discussed the project with Lethem and Gerber admitted that he had "misjudged" him.<ref name= "omeg">{{cite web |author-link=Rich Johnston |last=Johnston |first=Rich |url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/columns/index.cgi?column=litg&article=2168|title=Into the Unknown |website=Comic Book Resources|date= June 14, 2005|access-date=May 1, 2013|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071013192956/http://comicbookresources.com/columns/index.cgi?column=litg&article=2168|archive-date=October 13, 2007|url-status= live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>  
The first issue of the revamped ''Omega the Unknown'' was published in October 2007, and Marvel released another issue each month until the 10th was published in July 2008.  All 10 issues have been collected and reprinted in a single volume.
