I want to have... an abortion. Cartman. Yesuh- it's such a hard decision, but I just don't feel I can raise a child in this screwy world. About eight years ago. Eight years old. Really? But I just don't think I'm a fit mother. Well, I think you need to keep ''your laws'' off of ''my body''.  Well, that's exactly what I intend to do. Good day! ...And so you see, Congressman O'Reilly, that's why I think abortion laws should be changed. But the person at Unplanned Parenthood said you were who I had to talk to about changing the law. Oh, dear. Don't you see, Governor? I should have a right to have an abortion if I want one. I mean, what right do I have bringing another child into this overpopulated world? Then again, I should've thought of that before having sex. then againuh-- Oh, I just don't know...  Oh, thank you, ''thank'' you.  Terminated? Oh no uh- I didn't mean that. I meant the ''other'' thing you can do-what's that other A word? Yess, that's what I mean. Adoption. Oh, I should tell my son the truth about everything myself. Good day, Mr. President.  Yes, it's true. It's true. I'm sorry I never told you, Eric. I just thought, maybe it would be a little shocking to you.
