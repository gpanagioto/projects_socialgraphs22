Tom, I'm standing in front of the house where four insane boy terrorists have barricaded themselves inside a room with twenty-three live infant cattle. Several attempts to break into the room have proven unsuccessful, Tom, and the crisis is intensifying. Here's what some people have to say. The police chief of South Park says that there will be no negotiations with terrorists. Tom, it looks like I have an update: Yes, it looks like the boy terrorist story is not interesting news to anyone. Uh, nothing else was going on, Tom, so this was the only story we had to make ''seem'' important, but people are just simply tuning out. So, HBC will now be switching programming once again to "Puppies from Around the World." Tom, the calf terrorist standoff continues as now members of the FBI arrive to put an end to the conflict.  Tom, it looks as though the terrorists are now loading the baby cows into the back of a semi. This is still very uninteresting news, Tom.
