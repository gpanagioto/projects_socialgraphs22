The '''Molten Man''' ('''Mark Raxton''') is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].<ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |pages=231-232}}</ref> Once a chemical engineer who longed to get rich, Mark Raxton was caught in an accident that saw his body get covered by an experimental organic-liquid metal [[alloy]], which granted him superpowers, including the ability to generate extreme heat and radiation. Turning to a life of crime, he started off as an enemy of the [[superhero]] [[Spider-Man]], but eventually was redeemed. He is also the stepbrother of [[Liz Allan]].

The character has made appearances in several forms of media, including animated series and video games. A creature based on the "Molten Man" appeared in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] film ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]'' (2019), which was actually an illusion created by a series of drones operated by [[Mysterio]].

==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=December 2012}}
The character was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]] and first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #28 (September 1965).<ref>{{cite book|author= Manning, Matthew K.|editor= Gilbert, Laura|chapter= 1960s|title = Spider-Man Chronicle Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2012|page = 30|isbn = 978-0-7566-9236-0|quote= Mark Raxton was a corrupt partner of [Spencer] Smythe's who worked with him on a liquid metal alloy project.}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Mark Raxton was born in [[New York City]]. He was a scientist who could not wait to use his skills to become rich and once worked at [[Oscorp]] Industries as the laboratory assistant to Dr. [[Spencer Smythe]], creator of the [[Spider-Slayer]]s. Raxton and Smythe developed an experimental new liquid metallic [[alloy]] for the Spider-Slayers from a [[Radioactivity|radioactive]] [[meteor]], but Raxton in his greed and impatience, attempted to steal it and sell it, ignoring Smythe's protests that it needed further testing. In the ensuing fight with Smythe in the laboratory, Raxton spilled the liquid alloy all over himself, his skin absorbing it and turning golden.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=110}}</ref> Fearing for his life, Raxton ran for the nearest hospital, only to discover that the alloy had changed him for the better when he angrily punched an irate motorist's hood, buckling it. Realizing the great potential his new abilities afforded him, Raxton, calling himself the Molten Man, turned to crime to further his monetary gains. Peter Parker, as Spider-Man, nearly missed his [[high school]] [[graduation]] to stop the Molten Man's first crime spree.<ref>''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #28. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> Raxton was later released from jail, only to continue his criminal activities. However, he was once again defeated by Spider-Man.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #35. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

In his third encounter with Spider-Man, it was revealed that Peter's friend [[Liz Allan]] was Raxton's stepsister, and the Molten Man's metallic skin had begun to give off intense heat and to consume itself. His metallic skin became molten and he steals meteor fragments from a museum to attempt a cure. An encounter with Spider-Man resulted in his submergence in the polluted [[East River]], which temporarily reversed the deterioration.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #132–133. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

In another encounter, Raxton broke into a pharmaceutical company to steal chemicals which would reverse his condition permanently. When the procedure failed, he went berserk and demanded to speak to Liz, who agreed to talk to him and also tried to convince him to surrender. Liz was saved by Spider-Man and the Molten Man became buried beneath the laboratory.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #172–173. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> He later resurfaced at the same site and once again sought his stepsister. Spider-Man prevented the Molten Man from hurting her, knocking him into a swimming pool which extinguished the Molten Man's flames and cooled his metallic skin. He was then taken to the [[Vault (Marvel Comics)|Vault]], a prison for superhuman criminals.<ref>''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man#Volume 1 (1976-98)|Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #63. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

Raxton realized that his stepsister was the only member of his family who had not abandoned him. He was eventually released from the Vault and approached Liz to apologize. Spider-Man misunderstood his intentions and battled him once more. Reconciled with Raxton, Liz and her husband [[Harry Osborn]] gave Raxton a job as head of security at Osborn Industries.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #62. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> The Molten Man later teamed up with Spider-Man and the second Green Goblin against [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]] and [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]].<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #66. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> The Molten Man was then kidnapped along with Liz, Normie Osborn and Spider-Man by Harry Osborn, who had suffered a mental relapse, making him the Green Goblin once again. The Molten Man was saved by Spider-Man.<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #189. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> The Molten Man and Spider-Man have since become friends, and the Molten Man has occasionally used his powers to aid Spider-Man against other supervillains.{{issue|date=August 2019}} A few times he has been a bodyguard for Peter Parker's friends and family when disasters overwhelm the city.{{issue|date=August 2019}}

In [[The Gathering of Five and The Final Chapter|the months following]] the [[Clone Saga]], Raxton was abducted by Norman Osborn, the [[Green Goblin]], and brainwashed. Under mind control, the Molten Man attacked and killed Osborn's henchman [[Alison Mongraine]], the only person who knew of the location of Peter and Mary Jane's baby.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #440–441. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> Although the Molten Man has since recovered from the mind control, he still bears a heavy burden of guilt over the incident.{{issue|date=August 2019}}

Sometime after Harry Osborn's death, Raxton is summoned when mysterious forces kidnap Liz Allan's son, [[Normie Osborn]]. The Molten Man uses his brawn and brains to help Spider-Man and the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' reporter [[Ben Urich]] uncover what happened. Raxton is later pressed into a supervillain group again when the [[Chameleon (Marvel Comics)|Chameleon]] approaches him and threatens to kill Normie if Raxton does not join his 'Exterminators'.<ref>[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/exterminatorschamln.htm Exterminators] at Marvel Universe Appendix</ref> Raxton is consequently forced to attack Liz Allan.{{issue|date=August 2019}}

During the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' storyline, the Molten Man and the [[Scarecrow (Marvel Comics)|Scarecrow]] were used as bait for [[Captain America]]'s [[Secret Avengers]], only for the [[Punisher]] to arrive. Raxton is left in critical condition after being attacked by the Punisher.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://marvel.com/news/comics/760/punishers_hit_list| title= Punisher's Hit List| publisher= [[Marvel Comics]]| date= January 24, 2007| access-date= May 25, 2015}}</ref>

Raxton next appears, still in poor condition, under the care of Liz Allan. When Harry Osborn comes to visit Liz and Normie, he and Liz argue. Hearing Liz speak Harry's name, Raxton awakens and attacks him, screaming that Harry has hurt his family for the last time and will "die for real".<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #581. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> Spider-Man intervenes, but he has trouble fighting Raxton, whose powers have grown out of control. Spider-Man manages to trap Raxton in [[asphalt]], and Harry provides him with a cure that Oscorp had been working on upon using volunteer Charlie Weiderman, the other "Molten Man". The cure is successful, returning Raxton to his original human state. Although he finally was rid of the alloy, he still retained his powers, such as super strength, energy manipulation and a new power to incinerate anything by producing fire from his palms. Harry built him a special suit, using a part of the alloy and his DNA, to help him control his powers.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #582. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

When Liz Allan became the head of [[Alchemax]], she used the company's cutting-edge technology to cure Raxton of his condition. Even though he was constantly monitored, he was no longer a threat to society and started working as a member of Alchemax's security force. As Alchemax and [[Parker Industries]] competed for a contract to build a new prison, Raxton and [[Tiberius Stone]] used Raxton's connections to hire the [[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|Ghost]] to sabotage Parker Industries.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 3 #16. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Originally, Mark Raxton was given unnatural powers after the exposure to an experimental liquid metal alloy obtained from a meteor discovered by [[Spencer Smythe]]. His body completely absorbed its organic properties, turning all of these external tissues into a solid metallic substance, as well as trunks, belt, and boots he wore right before the accident. As a result, the Molten Man possesses superior strength and high resistance to physical injury. His skin is composed of a frictionless metal that causes things to slip off, including Spider-Man's webbing. Raxton's metallic fingers are sensitive enough to [[Lock-picking|pick locks]] (making him an expert [[Safe-cracking|safe cracker]]).<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #35. Marvel Comics (New York)</ref> He can generate fierce flames, incinerating anybody who tries to touch him or shooting fire-like blasts at his foes. At one time, his body became molten lava, allowing him to project radiation and heat up to {{convert|300|°F|°C}}.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #132-133. Marvel Comics (New York)</ref> In this form, the Molten Man's metallic skin would reach a critical stage at which point it could actually dissolve, slowly at first, then faster, and eventually be burned away by its own temperature.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #172-173. Marvel Comics (New York)</ref>

Additionally, unlike most of Spider-Man's more thuggish villains, the Molten Man had brains to complement his raw physical strength. An intelligent, but very sane scientist, Raxton was smart enough to learn from his own mistakes and not fall for the same trick twice. He is a college graduate with a Bachelor of Science degree in [[chemical engineering]].
