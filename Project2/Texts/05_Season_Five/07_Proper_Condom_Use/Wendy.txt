Oh, we ''wanna'' hear it, Ms. Choksondik. We're excited. I didn't mean that- Stay away from me, Stan! Are you wearing a condom? Don't you know that without wearing a condom you could get a disease? You guys have to wear condoms. Now, please, just, just go away. We don't want your AIDS.  Stay away from us, bastards! We don't wanna get pregnant! Yeah. Thank God.
