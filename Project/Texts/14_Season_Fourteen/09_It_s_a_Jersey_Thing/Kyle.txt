Mom, Dad, what's "muff cabbage"?  The new neighbors that moved in next to Stan's house. Me and Ike saw the mom get a parking ticket, and she called the parking cop "muff cabbage". She said they're from New Jersey. Yeah. Stan said they're having them over for dinner tonight. Know what, Ma?  Is ''that'' why there's crap on my doorstep every morning? Where the hell are they coming from?!   Hey, dudes. What are you talking about? So what? No, it doesn't! I'm not from Jersey. I was born here. What's strike three?! Shut the fuck up!  What? Why does it matter?! No, it isn't! No.  Oh my God! Hold on. Ah, I'm, ah... n-not right now.  Not now, Mom. Please. All right, all right.   What am I, Mom?  What are you saying?!  No! I don't wanna look like this! I can hide it!  I can't ever let anybody know! I told you Cartman, I'm not one of them! I don't wanna live in West Jersey any more than you do! That's enough!   Why? You just wanna lock me in there because you think I'm one of them. I'm not going in any meat locker so you can trap me! All right, fine, Cartman! You really want me to go in there, I'll...  Dude, Cartman, what is that behind you? No, I- I'm serious. What is that behind you? Oh, God.  Get out of here! Agggh! Agggh!   Get out of here, you piece of garbage! You wanna smoosh, go creepin' somewheres else! You're garbage! You know that?! You're cabbage!  Yeah. The more distance between me and the others from Jersey, the better I feel. It's a, uh, it's a Jersey thing.
