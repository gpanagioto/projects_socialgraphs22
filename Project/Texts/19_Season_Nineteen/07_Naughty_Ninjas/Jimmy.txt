Well Dad, I just re-really like being a part of something. I feel like it's character-building and it's lots of fun. What do we believe in? We believe in something greater than ourselves, and that by following our strict warrior code we believe that our faiths and our traditions are a way to a greater path - the p-p-p-path of the warrior. And as long as we stay united in honor we can defeat all our enemies.  Wow, the fellas were right. People are really freaked out by ninjas.
