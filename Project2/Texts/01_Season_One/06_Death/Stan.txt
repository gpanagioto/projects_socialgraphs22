It's eight o'clock, my favorite TV show is on. Can I eat my cake in the living room mom? Please, can I? Aw, dammit! Heheheh hehehe... My name's not Billy, grandpa. It's Stan. Sure. I'm not gonna kill you, grandpa. 'Cause I'll get in trouble. Leave me alone, grandpa. I'm not going to kill you, grandpa! Good night, grandpa. Whoa! Smells like you slaughtered a cow in there, Kenny! Is it okay to kill somebody if they want you to? My grandpa keeps asking that I kill him all the time, and sometimes I wonder if I should. Really?? Wow! So, is it okay to assist somebody with suicide, Mr. Garrison? Don't worry dude, we can all go watch it at my house. My parents don't get home until late. Yeah... Hey Chef. Bad. Chef, is it okay to kill your grandpa? No, I mean, kill my grandpa. See, I told you dude. What's the big deal? Why won't anybody talk about this??? Hi grandpa, I brought my friends over to watch TV, if that's okay. No grandpa, I'll get in trouble. No, I can't even kill a deer. Grandpa! Come on, Cartman, he's just trying to get to you. We can go watch Terrance & Phillip in the kitchen. Here Cartman, have some Snacky Cakes. I don't know what to do dude, my grandpa really wants to die. Hey, yeah! Jesus? Jesus, is, is it okay to kill somebody if they ask you to, because they're in a lot of pain, you know, like, assisted suicide, is that okay? Yes? Goddammit! What the hell is wrong with everybody? Kyle, don't be such a butt-hole! Okay, grandpa, okay. Just get out of the way of the TV. We're not watching Terrance & Phillip, I swear. I, I mean, Cartman was watching it. Aaah!! We didn't know what we were doing. We were just sitting there, watching Terrance & Phillip and... Yeah, I hope they protest TV shows forever. Aww, do I have to? Hey, what are you doing?! Uh, I guess. Okay, you, you can let me out now. Let me out, grandpa! I can't take it anymore, this music is terrible, it's, it's cheesy, but lame and eerily soothing at the same time. Eh, grandpa, I had no idea how bad it was for you. Now I understand. Sure I will grandpa, I will. Okay grandpa, all you have to do is sit there. We'll do the rest.  You got the cow all tied up? 'Kay, come on guys. You dumbass Cartman, it has to look natural, or else we'll all get busted. Are you ready, grandpa? Ok, here we go. Bye grandpa, it was nice knowing you. What is that?! Hey, he's coming towards us. Mom! Death is here, and and he's trying to take us all away with him! Yeah, but, mom! Dad, Death is coming! Dammit! You know, I think that if parents would spend less time worrying about what their kids watch on TV, and more time worrying about what's going in in their kid's lives, this world would be a much better place. Good point man. Ahhhh!  Hey look! Wow, I guess Death was just coming after Kenny the whole time. Whoa! Come on you guys, let's go home. What do you mean? I don't know. We, we could start breathing gas fumes. Cool! What are you doing grandpa? That's my silly grandpa.
