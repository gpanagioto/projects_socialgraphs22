What's a dildo, Kenny? Dude, that kicks ass! Whoa, Cartman! Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night. Dude! Visitors! That wasn't a dream Cartman, those were visitors! Visitors are real. What's gonna be for lunch today, Chef? They took him on their ship. Dude, they did, huh? Aliens stuck stuff up your ass! Good morning, Miss Crabtree. Oh, don't worry about him. Yeah, whatever, ya fat bitch. I said I have a bad itch. Cartman, are those the same Visitors you saw? Well, we can't do anything for now, that fat bitch won't let us. Uh, I said that rabbits eat lettuce.  Okay, okay, let's ditch school and go find him. Dude! Dude! It's the alien anal probe. It's shooting fire from Cartman's rectum! How can you eat when you're farting fire?  Where? Shut up, fat ass! I don't even like her! I do not! Bleech!  Holy crap! It says she wants to meet me at Stark's Pond after school.  What? How do you know she has a cat? Uh, Chef? Chef. Chef!  '''''CHEF!!!''''' Visitors took Kyle's baby brother. Whoa! Killer! Thanks, Chef. Okay, Cartman, you can stop farting fire now. What the hell was that? Kyle, look! It's them. Oh my God! They've killed Kenny! Hey look,  I think Kenny's okay. Owww. Wow, poor Kenny. Dude, Kenny is dead! See? Sorry, dude. I gotta go meet Wendy Testaburger. Dude, like Chef says, I've gotta get a piece of lovin' while the gettin's hot.  But her note said she'd be here. Bleech! Bleech! Bleech! Hey, wait. When do I get to make sweet love? Don't be such a fraidy-cat, Cartman. This rope will make sure they can't take you on board again. I think we have to signal them somehow. Come on Cartman, fart!  He can't hold it in forever. Hey, it's happening again. Now, do you believe us, Cartman? Cartman, there's a 80-foot satellite dish sticking out of your ass! Come down here, you stinking aliens!  Go on, Kyle, ask 'em for your little brother back. Yeah. That was beautiful, dude. No, they're leaving. Whoa, dude! Hey Wendy, what's a fuck?  Phew, I'm sure glad that's over with. Thanks for your help, Wendy. Hey, I didn't throw up. Bleech! Sorry. Cool. I think it's part of a Cheesy Poof. That's uummm... a hamburger from... that's from, like, two days ago. I don't know what the hell that is... Gee, the bus'll be here any minute, and Cartman still isn't around. I wonder what that thing was that the Visitors gave the cows. Oh, hey Cartman. Really, what about? That wasn't a dream, Cartman. That really happened.
