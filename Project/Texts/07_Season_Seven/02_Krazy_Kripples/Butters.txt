Hey Jimmy. Oh yeah, well, about that... Christopher Reeve came to town to do some kind of show, and everyone went to see ''him''. You know, Christopher Reeve, the guy who played Superman. Ww-well, because he got crippled, but now he can move his finger. He is an inspiration to us all. ''That's'' why everyone ditched on your show. Well, because I said I would. Oh, I'm a dork, huh?
