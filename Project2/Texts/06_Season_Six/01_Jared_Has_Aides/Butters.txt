Uh, hey, fellas.  Now gosh darnit, my name's ''not Kenny''! Kenny's dead, and you're all gonna have to learn to deal with it!  Woh, boy! Jared's comin' to town!  Now gosh darnit, my name's ''not Not-Kenny''! Wo-ah I'm getting steamed now.  Wow, Jared!  ''Me?!'' Oh, no, I thought you meant you. Eh, you're the fat one. But fellas, if I get fat my parents will ground me. You mean like Jared?  Well the heck with that! You said Jared was a penis-butt!  Wow. Oh, no, no, no! I ain't gettin' married; my parents will ground me!  Well, uh, how come? What's wrong with me? Ugh.  Wuh, wuh, I can't eat no more. Wull I can't eat no more. I-I just keep pukin' it up. No!

My mom and dad call in every hour from work to make sure I am here. If I don't answer the ph-phone, it'll know I'm- I'm up to no good! No- but you don't sound like me.
