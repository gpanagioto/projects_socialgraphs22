The serials were re-released as Video On Demand titles by [[Rifftrax]], the alumni project of former ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''  members Michael J. Nelson, Kevin Murphy and Bill Corbett. As of September 2014, they have released the entire serial.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rifftrax.com/search/apachesolr_search/batman|title=Search|access-date=2014-02-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170327054831/http://www.rifftrax.com/search/apachesolr_search/batman|archive-date=2017-03-27|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Turner Classic Movies]] has broadcast the film serial from June to November 2015 and from October 2021 to January 2022 in a weekly half-hour slot on Saturday mornings.

==Plot==
The dynamic duo face off against the Wizard, a hooded villain with an electrical device which controls cars to augment his compulsion to set challenges for Batman and Robin. The Wizard's identity remains a mystery to the caped crusaders throughout until the end.<ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |page=373}}</ref>

==Production==
[[File:Robert Lowery in Charlie Chan's Murder Cruise.jpg|left|thumb|<center>[[Robert Lowery (actor)|Robert Lowery]]</center>]]
"As usual on a Katzman production," note Harmon and Glut, "the low budget showed everywhere in money-saving shortcuts, and inadequacies." The Batman costume had a poorly fitting cowl and the Robin costume added pink tights to cover the "hairy legs" of both the actor and the stuntman. The [[Batmobile]] is again excluded, but instead of a limousine as in [[Batman (serial)|the first serial]], the duo drive around in a [[Mercury Eight|1949 Mercury]].<ref name="GMS">{{cite book

Several mistakes and failures of logic occur in the serial. One example is that the film shows the [[Bat-Signal]] working in broad daylight. Another occurs when, despite the fact that the heroes' [[utility belt]]s had been replaced by normal belts with no pockets or pouches for this serial, in order to escape from a vault, Batman pulls the nozzle and hose of an [[Oxy-fuel welding and cutting|oxy-acetylene torch]] from his belt to cut through a steel door (the tanks for the torch are not shown); to compound this mistake, it is a full-sized oxy-acetylene torch that would have been impossible to carry unseen on his person. Harmon and Glut suggest that this was probably scripted to be a miniaturised 3-inch torch, as used in the comics, but the filmmakers improvised in following the directions for a "blowtorch."<ref name="GMS" />

==Release==
[[File:Batman&RobinSerialDVDCover.jpg|thumb|DVD cover]]
In 1989, [[GoodTimes Entertainment]] released the serial on VHS, splitting the entire serial into two separate, budget-priced tapes recorded in LP mode. The GoodTimes edition was slightly edited, as well, with several minutes of the opening chapter mysteriously cut. In 1997, [[Columbia TriStar Home Video]] re-released the uncut serial (in SP mode) as a complete 2-tape VHS set. [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]] released the serial on [[DVD]] in 2005, timed to coincide with the theatrical release of ''[[Batman Begins]]''. Unlike [[Batman (serial)|its predecessor]], ''Batman and Robin: The Complete 1949 Movie Serial Collection'' has been given a restoration. On February 4, 2014, Mill Creek Entertainment released Gotham City Serials, a two-disc DVD set that includes both the 1943 Batman serial and the 1949 Batman and Robin serial. [[Rifftrax]] released a Video On Demand of the first installment of the short on July 16, 2013, featuring a running mocking commentary from [[Michael J. Nelson]], [[Kevin Murphy (actor)|Kevin Murphy]] and [[Bill Corbett]] of ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'' fame.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mst3kinfo.com/?p=16136#comments|title=New Short from RiffTrax… « Satellite News}}</ref> The final episode, "Batman Victorious," was released with commentary on September 19, 2014.
