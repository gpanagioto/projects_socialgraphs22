 Ahah, Mr. Marsh, you know, none of this was really necessary. For DNAandMe testing you can just swab the inside of your mouth yourself and send it in the mail. Well, to each their own I suppose.  Okay, I'll get this back to the lab and get the results to you as quickly as possible. Well, Mr. Marsh, we came because there was an irregularity with your test. Well it's just a little too odd. We need to do the test again. Mr. Marsh, please. If we could have one more sample. We want to be absolutely sure of what we found. Mr. Marsh, we were hoping to do a more precise test. It's better for harder cases like this, but... it is an anal swab this time.  Mr. Marsh, we're in a bit of a hurry, if you don't mind.  Oh, Mr. Marsh. Good. Wha-what are you up to? Well, uhhh, we did get your DNA results back this morning. Would you like to go over them? N'all right Mr. Marsh, here's your DNAandMe portfolio.  This shows that we actually found a mix of a few things in you regional ancestry. Nno, we didn't find any trace of any Native American DNA in your test. But as you can see here  your standard Caucasian British person. And, you might be interested to know that you're actually 2.8% Neanderthal, which is fairly high. Well, the Neanderthals were actually a species that was wiped out by Homo sapiens. Yes, but you see, because of some cross-breeding, some people like you still possess Neanderthal DNA. Isn't that interesting?
