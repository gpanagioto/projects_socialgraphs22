''Bay-bay! I'm hot.'' ''Tell me how was I to know?'' ''Was it 'cause I wanted to wait till we were married...'' ''The seasons change.'' ''And the world goes round.'' '''Cause I still love you, bay-bay!'' Hey, listen, we saw you out there in the audience. Blow whats? We all wear purity rings. It means we are going to be pure and not have sex until we're married. So, what do ya say, girls? You wanna be kid hipsters like us and wear purity rings too? This is bullpucky! Our decision is final! We have decided, as a band, not to wear purity rings anymore! We don't care about the company. Look, we just want our concerts to be about our music, and not about purity rings. Well we don't wanna be selling sex to little girls anymore. Well, well, maybe we'll just refuse to go onstage.   No, Mr. Mouse. Hello. Uh, we're gonna be doin' a live concert from Red Rocks tonight that will be live-broadcast on the Disney Channel. Well. Um.  We, we wear these to symbolize how pure we are and how we ...um don't approve of things that are naughty or filthy. Yeah. Uh huh. Huh? You see? We were right about the purity rings! A nice Christian symbol can't be used for profit gains. Come on guys.
