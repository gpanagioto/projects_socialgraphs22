Dude, Stan. Come on, dude, we're gonna go set off fireworks at Kenny's house. Dude, that's really weird. You didn't know you were slinging drugs for your grandpa?  Dude! Did you give Butters a crochet pillow to drop off?! Well, you need to get Hummels without making Butters a drug dealer! Stan, we told you we don't wanna be involved. Dude, we're not getting involved! Haww shit!
