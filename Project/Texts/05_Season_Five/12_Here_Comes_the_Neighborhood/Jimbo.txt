Yep, there goes the neighborhood.  Oh. I don't take kindly to rich folk. Neither does Ned. I remember back in the day, RICH folk weren't alLOWED in South Park! Now thery're movin' here in droves! Yeah. How many rich people does it take to screw in a light bulb? None! They can hire people to do it ''for'' them!  I guess we showed them! Lowercase "t"? Yeah. Next house we'll do a ''capital'' T, to show 'em we REALLY mean business! I guess we learned our lesson: you can't fight rich folk; they're just too powerful. ...Ghosts? But then you had us do all that for nothin'. Don't you see: If you get rich sellin' these homes, then there will still be rich people in South Park.
