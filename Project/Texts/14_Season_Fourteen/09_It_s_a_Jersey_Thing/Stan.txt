You guys do not understand. Having neighbors from Jersey is the worst! All night long they keep me awake! They're either screaming at each other or making some disgusting sex sounds. It seems like all people from Jersey do is hump and punch each other! They talk way too loud, they flip out for no reason, and every time they act like selfish assholes, they just go, "Oh, it's a Jersey thing. It's a Jersey thing." Did you know your mom was from Jersey? No, uh, it just explains a lot. Stop it, Cartman. Just 'cause Kyle's mom is a Jersey asshole doesn't mean Kyle is. Tryin' to help. My dad says to distribute all these guns.  Cartman, what the hell are we doing at Sizzler? Dude, what are you doing?  We gotta find a way past it! Jesus Christ, what the hell do we do?  ..Dude. Well, Kyle, looks like you're totally back to normal. I just have one question, Kyle. At Sizzler when you were yelling "Muff cabbage," what's muff cabbage?
