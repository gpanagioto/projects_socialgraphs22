Mr. Garrison isn't here right now. Oh, good one, Sherlock! You figure that out all by yourself?! No! No, you moron!  Mr. Garrison can't let the memories end! Just leave us alone! Why would he want to talk to a second-rate dopey-ass elementary-school psychologist?! You heard me, jackass! There's monkeys that make better counselors than you!
