 Hello? Hello? Can anybody hear me? Kyle? Where are you? I, I don't see you. ...Oh that makes sense.  Ha-hang on. I think something really big is about to go down. Kyle? What's happening? What?! You can't let them do that! Dude you have to stall them!  Uh- ...uh oh, what is that? Hey! G-get out of here! Leave me alone! No, no! I got sucked through Operation Imagination Doorway at the Pentagon.  No, no, you don't understand. There's a nuke. The government is about to level this entire place. So the terrorists can't ever use it against us again. The Chosen One?  Kyle? Kyle, what happened? What?? Dude, you can't let the government fire off that nuke! Well you have to convince them they ''are'' real! Whatever it takes, you have to do it, all right?!  Hang- hang on, Kyle, Jesus wants to talk to you.  Kyle! Dude! How did you do that, Butters? Dude.
