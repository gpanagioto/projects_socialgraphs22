====Live-action====
* Magpie makes her live-action debut in the episode "[[13 Stitches (Gotham)|13 Stitches]]" of the fifth season of ''[[Gotham (TV series)|Gotham]]'', portrayed by Sarah Schenkkan.<ref name="punisher">{{cite news |last=Whitbrook |first=James |url= https://io9.gizmodo.com/punishers-showrunner-wants-daredevil-and-kingpin-if-t-1831909982 |title=Punisher's Showrunner Wants Daredevil and Kingpin...If the Show Gets Another Season |work=[[io9]] |date=January 24, 2019 |access-date=January 24, 2019}}</ref> Her visual appearance is based on the character's ''Beware the Batman'' design and her obsession with shiny objects remains intact as her reputation is known by even [[Selina Kyle (Gotham character)|Selina Kyle]]. However, her real name "Margaret Pye" is not mentioned in the episode. During the [[Batman: No Man's Land#In other media|No Man's Land]] event, she steals a diamond from the [[Oswald Cobblepot (Gotham)|Penguin]], causing him to cut a deal with Selina Kyle to track her down. Cobblepot and Kyle find Magpie's hideout, whereon Selina tries to use her whip to capture the thief. Magpie recognizes her as the one who stabbed [[Jerome and Jeremiah Valeska|Jeremiah Valeska]] before revealing that the room they are in is filled with her explosive replicas.

* Magpie appears in the ''[[Batwoman (TV series)|Batwoman]]'' episode "Who Are You?", portrayed by [[Rachel Matthews]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tvline.com/2019/10/02/batwoman-photos-gabriel-mann-tommy-elliot-hush-rachel-matthews-magpie/|title=Batwoman Baddies First Looks: Revenge Fave Gabriel Mann Is Hush, Rachel Matthews Cast as Magpie|website=TV Line|author=Matt Webb Mitovich|date=2 October 2019 |language=en|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref> Similar to the original comics, this version is a professional thief who covets expensive jewels while using 3D-printed bombs as distractions in her robberies. In her civilian identity, '''Margot Pye''' poses as a photographer to canvass the location for her heists, which leads her in a plot to steal [[Martha Wayne]]'s necklace from [[Batwing (DC Comics)|Luke Fox]] which brings her alter ego against Kate Kane as [[Batwoman]]. After obtaining Magpie's plans, Batwoman finds that she will strike a museum event where Martha Wayne's necklace is being donated to. When Magpie attacked, she unleashed some pearl bombs which Batwoman had to protect people from. After the last one was disposed of before it can harm a girl, Batwoman used her grappling hook to pull Magpie off a building causing her to fall into the nearby fountain for the Crows to apprehend. After Kate recognizes Magpie's true identity, [[Sophie Moore]] has the Crows take Magpie to [[Blackgate Penitentiary]]. In "A Narrow Escape", Magpie is shown to be incarcerated at Arkham Asylum. When [[Hush (character)|Tommy Elliot]] called her a [[myna]] to Dr. M. Butler, Magpie corrected Tommy by stating that she is a Magpie. In the episode "If You Believe in Me, I'll Believe in You", Alice releases Magpie to steal a journal written by Lucius Fox from Tommy's gangster contact Johnny Sabatino. After Batwoman thwarts this plot, Magpie manipulates her sister Reagan Nye (portrayed by [[Brianne Howey]]) to get it for her. Once that was done, Magpie gives the journal to Alice who has the tracker in her removed. In the episode "A Lesson from Professor Pyg", Ryan and Alice were tracking someone who's using a bullwhip and believing Magpie is doing all of this only to learn that she prefers shiny objects. It was later revealed that it's [[Flamingo (comics)|Flamingo]] who's doing all of the victims.
