Haha! Aharmani Exchange? Yeah, dude.  Nobody does. They're too expensive.  Is that fun? Alright. I'll kick you in the nuts, Stan!  Yeah. We're guys, dude. We find something about ''all'' our friends to rip on. We made fun of you for being rich just like we make fun of Butters for being wimpy. Right. And Stan for being in love with Wendy. And Cartman for being fat. And Cartman for being stupid. And Cartman for having a whore for a mom. And Cartman for being a sadistic asshole No dude. Because since you got your feelings so hurt for being ripped on, now we think you're a pussy.  Come on, Nurse Tolkien. We're gonna play football, you puss.
