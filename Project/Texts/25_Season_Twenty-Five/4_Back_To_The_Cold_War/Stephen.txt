Don't wave at us, Butters!  Judges hate when they wave. He needs to not do that. Come on, Butters. Come on!  We should just pull Butters out of dressage. He sucks at this. Don't you understand, Linda? I'm scared. The big competition is this weekend. Butters will be going up against the Russians.  Boo, Russia! Boooo!  Don't you know who that is? That's Dan Solokov's kid! Dan Solokov? Who works at the Ace Hardware over in Meeker? Even the kid's pony is a Russian Etruscan!  You piece-a-shit communist! You won't take our freedoms away! Boo, Russia! Alright, Butters, you've just got two more days before the dressage competition. You're gonna have to do better than that, Butters. You see that little Russian kid over there?  That kid doesn't give a shit about you. He just wants to win and take what little patriotism our country has left. You didn't live through the Cold War, Butters, but we did. This tournament is going to be turned into a political spectacle, and we have to win. Otherwise, I'm afraid we'll have to give your pony away to communists who slaughter ponies and donkeys to make skin cream. That's mostly the Chinese, but a commie's a commie. Now, that little prick is trying to intimidate you. I want you to go in there and show him how an American rides! Butters! Butters, what the hell are you doing?! You have to learn to control! Butters, what the hell is that?!  Jesus, Linda, what are we gonna do? What are you doing here? Mr. Mackey? What the hell are you doing here?! I'll ask the questions, I've got the gun! Shut up, Linda! What kind of problems? So, you want them to win, huh? You're a traitor! Yeah, right...since when do you care about dressage?! Mr. Mackey... we were just here to try and give that pony diarrhea by feeding it Erewhon. We're on your side.  Oooh, no! No! We're all dead, Linda. What's he doing?! He's fighting for democracy! Go, Butters! He's got 'em! Mackey, we did it!
