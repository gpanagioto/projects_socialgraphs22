Created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Don Heck]], the character made his first appearance in ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' #34 (Nov. 1966).<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=215}}</ref> He would become a recurring enemy of [[Iron Man]] and plays a key role in the end of the "Iron Man: The Inevitable" miniseries.

Arthur Parks started out as a scientist that invented small, wrist mounted lasers and used them for criminal pursuits. At one point he was a member of the [[Lethal Legion]] and at another point he was poised to take over the world due to his possession of the [[Serpent Crown]], but is foiled by the Avengers. At one point it appeared that the Living Laser exploded in space, but in reality his body was transformed into [[photon]] form, making him an actual living laser.

==Powers and abilities==
A gifted research scientist with expertise in [[laser]] technology and a [[Ph.D]] in physics, Arthur Parks began his criminal career using wrist-mounted laser projection units, and later implants miniature laser [[diode]]s into his skin which absorb energy. With the diode implants, Parks is capable of energy projection, [[light refraction]] for [[invisibility]] and [[illusion]] generation.

Parks's material body is eventually replaced by photons due to an overloading of the diode implants. By increasing the [[density]] of the photons comprising his form, Parks can achieve "solidity", project photons as energy beams, and create [[three-dimensional]] [[holographic]] images. The character also possesses limited telepathic abilities and can [[Speed of light|travel at light speed]].

Stark learned why Parks was attacking him, and tried to atone for what he had done and convince Parks to stop his attack.
