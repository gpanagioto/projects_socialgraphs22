South Park Elementary, 4th grade classroom. The bell rings and Mr. Garrison's class takes their seats.

Mr. Garrison

Okay, children, let's take our seats! Good morning, kids! So great to see you! [the class is silent] I know it's always a little hard coming back from a break. You know, you know, we've had a few distractions but let's just pick up where we left off. [he sits down on a stool] Kids, over this last break, I met somebody. And, uh, I'm pretty excited. And, uh, we've been really enjoying each other's company, and, you know, things got physical. His name is Rick, and, uh, well, anyway I really wanted you to meet him, just-- you know, he's a – he's a little nervous, so just be cool, okay? [he gets up and opens the classroom door] Come on, Rick. Oh, come on, you big silly, they're not gonna bite you. [he pulls Rick into the classroom] Class... this is Rick. [pause] Now, look, we're not gettin' married tomorrow or anything. We're just enjoying each other's company and seeing where this whole thing takes us.

Rick

This is really awkward. I-I told you I thought this was a bad idea.

Mr. Garrison

He's very shy, but I wanted you kids to know that he treats me really well. Way better than that narcissistic psychopath Marcus!

Rick

[awkward pause] I-I should be going.

Mr. Garrison

Okay, okay, well, you're gonna come pick me up after school?

Rick

Yeah, yeah, you're done at 4:00?

Mr. Garrison

I'll be ready like 3:30. [Rick leaves] They like you. They do! [pause] No, that's just them being them. [pause] Okay, text me at lunch! Bye Ri-i-i-i-ick! [he waves and sits down at his desk while the kids stare silently; his cellphone chimes] Oh, shit, it's Marcus! Should I answer it?! [they don't answer] I have to answer it. He's gonna suspect something. Just keep quiet about Rick! Don't say anything! [he answers the phone] H-hey Marcus. What's up? [pause] No. [scoffs] I'm in the classroom with the kids. Aren't– Aren't I, kids?! [he motions for them to answer; they remain silent] O-okay, you couldn't really hear them, but I'm with the kids. No. [pause] Who's Rick? We've never heard of Rick, have we, kids?! [silence] Will you fucking say something? Marcus, Marcus, I really don't– why?! Fine! Go ahead! [pause] That's fi-fine! Okay, geez! [he hangs up angrily] Well, nice going, kids. What is wrong with you?! You don't listen, and you blatantly go against my directions! [PC Principal walks by the classroom]

PC Principal

What's going on here, students?

Mr. Garrison

I ask them for a response, and nothing! First they just sit there when I need their focus and their energy, and when I ask them–

PC Principal

Hey! You kids know that these teachers are doing their very best for your benefit?!

Mr. Garrison

I don't know how much more I can take of this.

PC Principal

I am sick and tired of students thinking they can walk all over their teachers who gave you everything they got!

Mr. Garrison

I've got enough problems as it is.

PC Principal

I tell you what else. This Friday, for pajama day at school, this class does not get to wear their pajamas. [the class protests in anger] You heard me! No pajama day for this class. Now maybe you'll remember to have some respect for your teacher!

+++++


South Park Elementary hallway. Eric Cartman is pacing back and forth in anger while the rest of the kids listen

Cartman

This is bullshit! They can't take our pajamas from us! Who does the principal think he is?!

Stan

After everything we've been through the past couple years, they're gonna take pajama day from us, too.

Kyle

We didn't even do anything wrong!

Cartman

We didn't do fucking anything wrong! We keep not doing anything wrong, and we keep getting fucked!

Butters

Guess that's just part of being a kid these days.

Tolkien

Yup.

Cartman

Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait. We are not just going to stand for this?!

Stan

What else can we do, brah?

Cartman

Brah, we can have some Goddamn balls! What does Matt Damon say on that Bitcoin commercial? Fortune favors the brave.

Clyde

My dad says that he listened to Matt Damon and lost all his money.

Cartman

Yes, everyone did. But they were brave in doing so. We have to stand up for ourselves, you guys. I say we go right to the principal's office and tell him what's up, brah. [Stan and Kyle look at each other]

+++++


PC Principal's office. He's curling weights when the phone beeps.

PC Principal

[he answers] Yeah.

Woman

Some kids want to speak with you about pajama day.

PC Principal

Alright, send 'em in. [Wendy enters the room with Heather and Millie, the latter sobbing]

Wendy

Mr. Principal sir, can we please wear our pajamas on pajama day?

PC Principal

I'm sorry, ladies. I've made a decision, and I'm sticking to it.

Wendy

Mr. Principal, we really didn't do anything wrong.

PC Principal

I appreciate your sentiment, but as principal of the school, it's my job to make decisions and stand by them to maintain order.

Heather

[angrily] Do you know how long we've waited for pajama day?! You can't force us to wear normal clothes! What is this, Nazi Germany?!

PC Principal

Hey! How many times have I told you kids not to bring up Nazi Germany when you don't get something you want?!

Heather

[leaving with the other two girls] You're a fascist!

PC Principal

Get out!

Heather

You're a fascist, and this whole school stinks of Nazis!

PC Principal

[to Mr. Mackey] I can't believe the things these students say sometimes.

Mr. Mackey

You better quit while you're ahead.

PC Principal

What?

Mr. Mackey

You don't understand how important pajama day is to kids. It's like the Met Gala for children.

PC Principal

If I change my mind now, I look weak.

Mr. Mackey

Mmkay... but I don't think this is gonna end up the way you want it to. [he walks away while the camera zooms in on PC Principal's face]

+++++


South Park Elementary, pajama day. The school is decorated for the occasion. Children are getting their pictures taken of them in their pajamas.

Boy

Hey look, it's Eric Cartman!

+++++


Cartman walks sadly through the hallway in normal clothes as everyone laughs at him. He then wakes up screaming in his room, realizing it was a bad dream.

Liane

[she bursts into Cartman's room] Eric! Eric! [she runs over to him] it's okay! What's wrong?!

Cartman

panting] Oh, God! I-I was at the school and it– it was pajama day, and I– I didn't have pajamas on and then I died! And then I died!

Liane

Shh! Eric! Eric, it's okay, sweetie. Shh.

+++++


PC Principal's office again. He is on the phone.

PC Principal

Yes hello, Ms. Cartman. This is the school principal returning your call. What can I do for you?

Liane

Uh, yes, I understand that you told my child that he isn't allowed to wear pajamas this Friday? What is this, Nazi Germany?

PC Principal

Your son is part of a class that lost their pajama day privilege, correct.

Liane

Well, I'm sorry, but I don't think it's safe for Eric to not wear his pajamas on pajama day. He could die.

PC Principal

Well I've already made my decision, and it's final.

Liane

Well, I'm not really sure where you get off telling me what my son can and can't wear. What do you think about that?

Cartman

Yeah, get 'em, mom! Tell him to fuck off!

Liane

In fact, I think you can fuck off.

PC Principal

Ms. Cartman, if you are worried about your son's safety, then perhaps you should just keep him home for pajama day.

Liane

Uh, I can just keep him home on pajama day?

Cartman

No, I can't stay home because you have to go to work because fucking Matt Damon told you fortune favors the brave and now you lost all your fucking money!

Liane

Matt Damon told me fortune favors the brave, and I lost all my fucking money!

PC Principal

I'm sorry?

Liane

I'm going to rally all the parents, and I'm going to the press! If my son can't wear his pajamas to school, then no kids are going to wear their pajamas to school! [she hangs up]

Cartman

Fuck yes, mom, that was fucking sweet! Wait, no, I want to wear my fucking pajamas to school! You fucked it up, Mom!

+++++


A news report is being recorded outside of South Park Elementary.

Reporter

Tom, guten tag and heil Hitler. Apparently, we are living in Nazi Germany. The elementary school behind me is telling some students they can't wear their pajamas to pajama day. The principal of the school says the students are being reprimanded for bad behavior. But many parents are left wondering... nehmen sie meinen Schlafanzug? The school's mandate has caused a backlash with members of the community who are now wearing their pajamas to work in protest!

+++++


The Broflovski residence. Gerald steps outside, dressed in his pajamas.

Laurie Berkner

Pajama time! [the song "Pajama Time" starts playing as Gerald walks to work and enters his law firm, all of his coworkers are also wearing pajamas]

+++++


A montage begins showing the townsfolk working while wearing pajamas

Randy

Making a difference can be fun!

+++++


Some adults throw a rock through PC Principal's window and flips him off. The montage continues before cutting back to South Park Elementary. Wendy stands at her locker, looking forlorn.

PC Principal

Testaburger!

Wendy

[startled] Oh, fuck!

PC Principal

I need to talk to you now! [he enters the gymnasium and she follows]

Wendy

Yes?

PC Principal

Ms. Testaburger, I need you to get me out of this.

Wendy

Sir?

PC Principal

I made a tactical decision. Now if I go back and say maybe I was wrong, I look weak.

Wendy

Well, Mr. principal, if you just–

PC Principal

Zip it! I need you to get everyone in your class to work together and have Mr. Garrison come to me saying your pajama day should be reinstated. You get the girls and the boys to work together. This is your problem now, Testaburger. [she stands in silent shock as he exits]

+++++


South Park realtors. All of the adults are wearing pajamas.

Frank

Hey, guys– I just wanna say I'm really proud to be a part of this office. Wearing our pajamas shows that we care about those school kids– that we care about other people. South Park Realtors!

All

South Park Realtors!

Mike

Hey guys– sorry I'm a little late. Got a flat tire on the interstate. [he isn't wearing pajamas] What's the latest news?

Frank

[he glares] What's going on, Mike?

Mike

Well, what do you mean?

Frank

You're not wearing... pajamas.

Mike

Oh– yeah– I-I didn't really wanna wear pajamas.

Frank

We're all wearing pajamas.

Mike

Yeah, I just didn't want to with the rain and slush outside. It just... didn't make any sense to wear pajamas.

Unnamed Man #1

Uh, Mike, we're trying to do the right thing, and it only works if we all wear pajamas.

Mike

Well you can't force me to wear pajamas! What is this, Nazi Germany?

Frank

We aren't telling you to wear pajamas– he walks over and opens the door] But I'm pretty sure this sign right here on the door says you have to wear pajamas!

Unnamed Man #2

Hey, Mike, just put on some pajamas. It's not a big deal.

Mike

Good, if it's not a big deal, then I'll choose not to wear pajamas.

Unnamed Woman #1

You redneck, gun toting piece of shit.

+++++


Cartman's basement. He's standing at a makeshift podium delivering a speech to his classmates.

Cartman

Ladies and gentlemen. We have been at war for too long. Yesterday, Wendy Testaburger came to me and said we need to get the boys and girls together to find a solution for pajama day. I was delighted. [he flips a page] We must put our differences aside, because we all want one thing. The right to be in our jam jams this Friday all cozy wozy.

Heather

It's comfy womfy.

Cartman

Comfy womfy, cozy wozy, the point is, we are getting fucked.

Wendy

We all have to be on the same page here.

Cartman

That's right. We need all of us. Boys and girls working together. And so together, what are we going to do?

Butters

[he raises his hand] We could shoot up the school!

Cartman

Shoot up the school, nice. It's just done a lot. Anything a little more original?

Craig

We burn down the cafeteria?

Jimmy

We smear human shit on all the windows?

Wendy

We apologize. [the boys all look at her, offended] You guys want a chance to save pajama day? Then join us in telling Mr. Garrison we're all sorry.

Craig

We didn't fucking do anything.

Wendy

At school tomorrow, we all tell Mr. Garrison he was right and that we've been terrible students. That we weren't listening and that he deserves to be angry with us. We tell him how much we care and that we want to see him more as a human being than just a teacher.

Cartman

That is just the kind of manipulative, psychotic thinking that we needed.

Stan

We can do this! 

Wendy

We just have to be brave.

Cartman

But not too brave or else Matt Damon will come and take all our money.

Craig

Alright, dude, can we lay off the Matt Damon jokes, please? They're just getting old.

+++++


Once again a news report is taking place outside of South Park elementary.

Reporter

Tom, warm up the wienerschnitzel and put on your lederhosen, because now people are being told to stop making Matt Damon jokes. Opponents are claiming that the jokes are already tired and Matt Damon had every right to make a Bitcoin commercial, so the jokes need to stop. All we can say is– Verzeihung für die Witze. 'Cause it's gettin' real Nazi Germany up in here. Back to you, Tom.

+++++


IHOP, daytime. A woman is standing outside denying a man entry.

Sarah

I'm sorry, sir, but we aren't seating anyone who isn't wearing their pajamas.

IHOP Customer

Please, ma'am, I just want to sit down and eat.

Sarah

I understand, but the management prefers that everyone inside be nice and comfy womfy.

IHOP Customer

So I have to be comfy womfy to get a Rooty Tooty Fresh N' Fruity?

Sarah

Sir, I'm just the hostess here. If you prefer, you only need to wear your pajamas to get in. You don't have to wear them at your table while you're actively eating.

IHOP Customer

So it's okay if we put on our pajamas, walk through the whole restaurant to the table, and then take our pajamas off. What is the fucking point?! [a police car pulls up behind them]

Police Officer #1

What seems to be the problem here? [the other cop puts the man in handcuffs]

IHOP Customer

Oh, I see! Bringst du mich ins Gefängnis? Bringst du mich der Führer? [escorted in the back of the car]

+++++


South Park Elementary. All the kids are sitting at their desks, looking apologetic.

Wendy

Remember... no matter how angry he is, tell him he's right. [the bell rings; Mr. Garrison enters the classroom excitedly]

Mr. Garrison

Good morning, class! [he starts singing and snapping] Good mornin'! Good morning'! Good mornin', good mornin'. To you and you and and you and you! [he pulls up a stool and sits down] So... how are you guys? [silence] You're probably wondering how things are with Rick. I just flat out told him that Marcus was still calling me and you know what Rick said? He said, "If you're not over Marcus, then take some time. I'll be here." Is that not the sweetest thing you've ever heard? I called him back like three minutes later and I said, "I don't need time. I need you." I said, "Can I just come over?" And the way he held me when I got to his house, it was like, "Ohhh, this is security." And then later on when we were in bed, I'd had my head on his chest, and I was just playing with his chest hairs a little bit, and I said– Excuse me, Butters, are you paying attention? [he pauses, looking at Butters who is asleep] Could somebody wake Butters up, please?

Kyle

Dude!

Butters

Wuh huh huh?! Yes?

Mr. Garrison

I'm sorry Butters, am I boring you?

Butters

Uh, no, sir!

Mr. Garrison

Okay, well, then maybe you can tell me what Rick said when I told him about Marcus?!

Butters

Uh... Huh... He...

Mr. Garrison

Anybody? Does anyone know what I said when Rick held me tight?!

Wendy

"This is..."

Cartman

"This is really nice"?

Mr. Garrison

"This is security!" None of you are paying attention! None of you know the answers, do you?!

PC Principal

What's going on, students?

Cartman

Aw, God damnit!

+++++


Park County Police Station, night time.

Yates

Jesus, I've never seen so many arrests in one day!

Police Officer #2

Sir, we got another one.

Yates

But she's wearing pajamas.

Police Officer #2

Yeah but she was caught shitting on the car of a guy who wasn't wearing pajamas.

Unnamed Woman #3

That's right, and I'd do it again.

Yates

Alright, put her in with the others.

IHOP Customer

Hey, don't put that pajama wearing slut in here with us!

Police Officer #3

Chief, they're asking for your assistance down on Brighton street,

Yates

What now?

Police Officer #3

Looks like we got a domestic dispute.

Yates

Oh, finally something normal!

+++++


Brighton Street, night time. An arrest is taking place.

Mr. Billings

I told her I just wanna go to bed! If you're not gonna let me go to bed then I'm calling the police!

Mrs. Billings

He's just gonna go to bed wearing the clothes he wore all day! I don't wanna sleep in that filth!

Mr. Billings

Well, I don't have to wear pajamas!

Yates

Okay, Mr. Billings, but... you have to understand, it is bedtime.

Mr. Billings

So what?

Yates

Well, you should just understand where your wife is coming from. If any time makes sense to wear pajamas, it would be as you're going to sleep at night.

Mr. Billings

I don't care what time of day it is, I don't ever wear pajamas!

Yates

Alright, alright, listen. What if you were on a ski vacation. Hmm? A nice cozy condo after a long day hitting the slopes. The fire is crackling. You've got a cup of cocoa. You're telling me you wouldn't wear pajamas then?

Mr. Billings

No, I wouldn't wear pajamas!

Mrs. Billings

You would beg me for pajamas if we had a condo and cocoa!

Mr. Billings

No I wouldn't! No I wouldn't!

Yates

Alright, alright, is there any way the two of you could go to sleep tonight in this house together?

Mrs. Billings

He's not getting in bed in his clothes.

Yates

Okay, then you can just come sleep downtown at the station. Take her in, boys.

Mrs. Billings

What?! [two police officers arrest her] Oh, my God!

Mr. Billings

Ha ha, bye bye!

Unnamed Man #4

They're arresting people in pajamas? What is this, Nazi Germany?! [one of the pajama wearing citizens attacks the police officer]

Yates

Take him in, too! [they arrest the man] Arrest those people, and all of those people! This whole town is a powder keg about to go off. And tomorrow is pajama day.

+++++


Music plays as kids enter South Park Elementary, all wearing pajamas. A news broadcast is recorded of the event, with the reporter now dressed in an SS uniform.

Reporter

Tom, es ist ein wunderschöner Morgen und der Pyjama Tag ist endlich da. Alle Kinder tragen Schlafanzug ausser es würde den Kindern verboten. Eine band spielt das traditional lied von Deutschland, und allen sind glücklich... [turns to a student who is running to school and lifts his revolver] Lich rennen! Sie müssen gehen! [turns back to the camera] Pyjama Tag ist hier. Back to you, Tom.

+++++


PC Principal's office. He holds his head as the reporter continues to speak German.

Reporter

Hast du einen Matt Damon witz gemacht? Ich habe keinen Matt Damon witz gemacht.

+++++


Gunshots are heard, followed by screaming.

PC Principal

What the fuck, bro?

Wendy

[she enters] You wanted to see me, sir?

PC Principal

Bro... What am I supposed to do? [he starts crying and looks out the window] Do you know what a principle is? A principle is something that you see as a fundamental truth. You do something that you think is right out of principle! That's why I wanted to be principal. Tell your class they can run back home and put on their pajamas. I'll hand in my resignation this afternoon.

Wendy

Sir, maybe people won't lose respect for you if you change your mind. Saying you were wrong is sometimes the strongest thing you can do.

PC Principal

You're totally wrong about that. When all these people see I caved in to their insults and their offensive World War II comparisons, I'll be done.

Wendy

Then we can't put on our pajamas. Out of principle. The kids will be okay. At least we still have opposite day to look forward to.

PC Principal

No, you– Wait. What did you say?

Wendy

I said we'll be okay.

PC Principal

No. What day is opposite day at school?

Wendy

It's always the second Friday in March.

PC Principal

Testaburger! That's it!

+++++


Cartman is walking through the halls dressed in his normal clothes while students laugh at him.

PC Principal

[over the loudspeaker] Attention all students, this is your principal. I need to inform you that a mistake has been made. Mr. Mackey, your counselor, totally screwed up the calendar. Today is not pajama day. It is in fact opposite day. [the students murmur confusedly] So we will be having breakfast for lunch in the cafeteria, and anything else you've been told to do, you can now do the opposite.

Cartman

Fuck yes! It's opposite day!

+++++


The students all celebrate while music plays in the background. Mr. Garrison's class changes into their pajamas. Mr. Garrison pulls Rick into the classroom again, both wearing pajamas. The scene cuts to South Park Realtors.

Unnamed Woman #1

Hey, Frank! It looks like it's over! The school says the kids can wear what they want because it's opposite day.

Frank

It's opposite day? Well, shit, we gotta go put some normal clothes on!

Unnamed Man #4

Aw, how come?

Frank

Because we are people who believe very strongly in wearing pajamas to the workplace. If we're wearing pajamas on opposite day, that means we don't normally wear pajamas and we're douchebags like Mike!

+++++


Park Country Police Station. Sergeant Yates is letting all the 'criminals' out of the cell.

Yates

Alright, you can all go home. It's opposite day.

IHOP Customer

Oh, then should I be wearing pajamas?

Unnamed Man #5

I don't know what to wear now.

Unnamed Man #6

You can't make me wear pajamas!

Yates

That's fine, you can all wear whatever you want as long as it covers your dick and tits.

Unnamed Man #6

You can't make me cover my dick and tits!

+++++
