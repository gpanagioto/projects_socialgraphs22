Heidi? Heidi Turner? Where?  The park?  I miss my stuff. For what? You weren't the only one. I guess I didn't deserve a second chance. I really tried to make changes. I really tried to become a better person. To sh-show that I was trying to listen.  Women are funny, Heidi. Get over it. Every time Amy Schumer talks about her vagina, I lose my fuckin' mind. I don't have any friends. I don't know if I ever did. Kewl. 	Hey.  I was thinking again. About how women are just as funny as men. And then I realized... that the only way to really be sure is to see if African-Americans think they're funny. Because, black laughs matter. Yes, it is. Yes, you do.  Heidi, does it ever get any easier? Living in this world? You wanna go somewhere? I'll follow you.  Yeah. It's the best, dude. Try it. Yeah. I think I am too. Heidi, can I ask you something? 	Do girls... not have balls? So when a girl goes to scratch her balls, how does that work?  I just don't understand what's at the bottom of a vagina. 	...Holy shiiit.
