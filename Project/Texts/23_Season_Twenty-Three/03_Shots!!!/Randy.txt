<poem><i>Happy 300 thousand dollars.</i></poem> Can you believe it, gang? We've broken $300,000 selling weed.  "stupid" idea. Now we're living the dream.  Who wants shots?! [jumps into the scene] How many thousand dollars has Tegridy Farms made selling weed? $300,000!  We've got $300,000, just selling  Well? What'd you think, guys? Who cares, Sharon? Business is up. Yeah. We make money either way.  Shelley!  Stan! Mrs. Cartman? Whoa whoa! What's goin' on? Okay, okay. Come on. Let's get you inside and get you some weed.  Believe me, I know how that feels.  You try to do what's best for your family and all you do is get shit on. [hands the joint to Liane] That's just it.  When it comes to families, we have to do what we think is best. All-county immunization roundup? What's that? It's just... it's like, can't people see us trying to do what's best for my family? I'm trying to provide for them by running a business. I'm sorry if I make mistakes. And I get it from both sides, because my family's pissed off at me too. No, you don't!  No, you don't! Nobody understands. Yeah, like, everybody's doing business with China. It's like "get over it." I am. I'm afraid I haven't been very kind to that partner lately. I think maybe it's time for an apology. Where are you going? Do you remember we used to come here and look over the town lights together? I brought you here to apologize, Towelie. I let the money go to my head. I... I got greedy and I started acting like a towel. I need you back. I need Tegridy back, the way it used to be. No more harassing homegrowers. No more Med Men. China's actually a free and loving country that- [gets out of the car and chases after him] Wait, wait, Towelie, come on! I need you! Okay, okay. No more selling to the Chinese.  Fuck the Chinese government. Fuck the Chinese government! There! Hahaha! This is it. This is the moment that Tegridy Farms got back on track.
