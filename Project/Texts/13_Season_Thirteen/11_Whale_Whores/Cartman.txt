What do you mean? This song is sweet. I'm not too busy, Stan. No, I just don't care. At all.  Stan, me and Kenny don't give two shits about stupid-ass whaaales! Ahall right dude, this is pretty sweet! ''[his sweater has "SAVE THE WHALES" on it, while Kenny's parka now has "DOLPHIN LOVER" on it].'' What dude? We always have. That's not what we said. We were talking about Wales the country.  I ''deserve'' to be on TV.  Your show is fuckin' gay, dude! , we've dedicated all this time and all our lives to saving these majestic creatures. Shhh, Kenny...  He's always loved dolphins so much that he would do anything. Our gentle friends of the sea have saved the day. Because they know that only we can save them from the Japanese.  Dude, you know what? Japanese people ''really'' do not like whales.  Uh oh. Oh, I'm sorry. Am I making things uncomfortable for you Stan? It's your fault me and Kenny are in this mess! Sir, we actually don't give two shits about you killing whales. Can we go? What dude? Sorry.  A little gassy. 'Scuse me. So that's what this has all been about? Zzzzt zzzzsssht!  Dude, they won't rest until whoever is responsible is completely wiped out.
