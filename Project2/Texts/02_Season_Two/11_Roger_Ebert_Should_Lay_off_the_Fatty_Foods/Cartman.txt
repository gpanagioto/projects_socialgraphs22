Planetariums suck! I can sing the Cheesy Poofs song! Hey, there it is! I can sing the Cheesy Poofs song with both hands tied behind my back! But I'll have to sing the Cheesy Poofs song for that talent va-a-an!  But I wanna sing the Cheesy Poofs song on the commercial! How long is that Cheesy Poofs van gonna be outside? As if we care. Aw man, screw this. Excuse me, but I do believe that sucked ass! Eric Cartman. Thaat's right, suck on that.  I did it! I did it! I got a call-back for the Cheesy Poofs song! Yeah, dude, but I got in the finals for tomorrow! Hey you guys, when I'm done with that- Cheesy Poofs commercial, I bet I get all the free Cheesy Poofs I want.  It's sad how jealous you are, Kyle. It really is. Hey, be careful, asshole! Well, hello, it's all my little friends with all their little dreams. Let's see, where have I been, where have I been?  Wweell, I ''might'' have been over at the Cheesy Poofs call-back, winning regional championship! This is my regional championship certificate! Do you like it?  Hey, where is your regional championship 'tificate, Clyde? Oh, you don't have one? Hmmm. Do you have a regional certificate, Wendy? Nno? Apparently, only I do. Your haiku insults have no effect on me, Kyle. I'm regional champion. It's between me and four other kids. I'm on my way now with my mom to the finals. I wasn't picking it-I had an itch, for cryin' out loud! I don't know. There's a lot of competition here. Hey, look! They're giving away bread outside! Sike! I know, I know! Thank you.
