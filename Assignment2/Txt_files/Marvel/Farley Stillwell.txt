'''Farley Stillwell''' is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He is a scientist best known for transforming [[Mac Gargan]] into the [[Scorpion (Marvel Comics)|Scorpion]].

==Publication history==
Stillwell first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #20 and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]].

==Fictional character biography==
When [[J. Jonah Jameson]] first hired [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]], he was amazed at how he managed to obtain pictures of Spider-Man. He hired private investigator [[Mac Gargan]] to look into this. When Jameson saw an article about inducing animal mutations into humans, he visited the scientist that established this experiment: Dr. Farley Stillwell. Jameson first thought Stillwell was a [[crank (person)|crackpot]], but later saw him as an opportunity to take down Spider-Man. When he first went to see Dr. Stillwell in his lab, Jameson had him experiment on Gargan. Stillwell gave Gargan a high-tech scorpion-suit, and the Scorpion was born.<ref name="asm20">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #20</ref>

Shortly after the experiment, Stillwell ran some tests and found that his experiment wasn't a true success. He discovered that Scorpion would lose his sanity as he got stronger. Creating an antidote, Stillwell headed to where Spider-Man was fighting the Scorpion. Upon learning the side effects of the formula from Stillwell, Scorpion didn't want to lose his powers and climbed up a building. Stillwell went up after him and lost his grip. As he fell, Dr. Stillwell threw the serum at Gargan in a vain attempt to cure him. He missed and fell to his death.<ref name="asm20"/>

===Legacy===
It was later revealed that he had a brother named Harlan Stillwell who used the experiment to create the [[Human Fly (comics)|Human Fly]] after being held at gunpoint by Richard Deacon. After Richard became the Human Fly, he shot Harlan.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #10</ref>

The Stillwell brothers' technology would also later be used to give superpowers to the [[Answer (comics)|Answer]],<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Danny Fingeroth|penciller = Scott McDaniel|inker = Brad Vancata|colorist = Dave Sampson|letterer = Diana Albers|editor = Rob Tokar|story = Deadly Reunion|title = The Lethal Foes of Spider-Man|volume = 1|issue = #1|date = September 1993|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref> and the fourth [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]].<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Mark Waid and Tom Peyer|penciller = Paul Azaceta and Javier Rodriguez|inker = Paul Azaceta and Javier Rodriguez|colorist = Andres Mossa|letterer = Joe Caramagna|editor = Tom Brennan, Tom Brevoort, and Stephen Wacker|title = The Amazing Spider-Man|volume = 1|issue = #624|date = 10 March 2010|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

Jonah Jameson hires him to turn Mac Gargan into the Scorpion. Gargan later demands that Stillwell restore him to his former self, but the latter reveals he is unable to, which led to him being knocked out and hospitalized. In a flashback in "Make a Wish", Stillwell was the scientist that led an experiment involving '''neogenic'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> research,<ref name=Hague>Ian Hague, ''Comics and the Senses: A Multisensory Approach to Comics and Graphic Novels'', Routledge, 2014, ch. 2: "Sight, or, the Ideal Perspective and the Physicality of Seeing".</ref> that led to Peter Parker becoming Spider-Man.

Stillwell used him as a subject for her experiments in military cybernetics and mind control, turning him into an obedient living weapon. She orders Scorpion to break [[Rhino (comics)|the Rhino]] out of a prison transport to become her bodyguard. After Spider-Man defeats Scorpion and frees him from the mind control, the two work together to strike back at Stillwell, who has taken Dr. Jessica Andrews, Scorpion's love interest, hostage. Upon defeating Rhino with Spider-Man's help, Scorpion saves Dr. Andrews and attempts to kill Stillwell, but Spider-Man and Dr. Andrews convince him not to. As Scorpion flees, Spider-Man leaves Stillwell for the police.
