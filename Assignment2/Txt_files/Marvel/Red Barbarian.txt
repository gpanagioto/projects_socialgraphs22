The Red Barbarian was a [[Communist]] [[General officer|general]] in an unnamed country, known for his brutality.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://journals.chapman.edu/ojs/index.php/VocesNovae/article/viewFile/37/148 |title=Iron Man: America's Cold War Champion and Charm against the Communist Menace |author=Paul Fellman |publisher=Chapman University Historical Review |year=2010 |volume=1 |number=2 |pages=14â€“15 }}</ref> After an attempt to steal an [[atomic bomb]] prototype from [[Stark Industries]] is foiled by [[Iron Man]], the Red Barbarian is approached by another Soviet agent known as The Actor who is superior in [[Disguise|disguising]] himself. The duo scheme to steal the secret [[disintegrator ray]] [[blueprint]]s of Tony Stark. The Actor is sent to impersonate Stark and get the plans. The Actor succeeds in doing so, through the means of changing from disguise to disguise, and even learns the [[secret identity]] of Iron Man. However, Iron Man manages to get back the classified papers from The Actor and he in return impersonates The Actor impersonating Iron Man and rushes to meet the Red Barbarian. The general is tricked and believes that Iron Man is The Actor in disguise. When he demands for the blueprints, Iron Man replies that the suitcase (in which the blueprints are supposedly in) is [[booby-trapped]] and it can only be opened four hours later, and then leaves. Just then, The Actor returns. The Red Barbarian thinks he is the imposter and shoots him, before he can tell the general Iron Man's secret identity.
