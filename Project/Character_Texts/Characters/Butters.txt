Pass this up. 
Hey, Stan. Why I-I-I sure am glad you're here, 'cause then we'll have even more fun than we, why, than we was havin' before. Why, we wuh, we were havin' an awfully good time before you showed up, too, however. Nope. No way out. Buh, but there ain't nothin' upstairs but an old, stupid party anyways. It's better down here in the kids' room.  Uh, this here is Dougie. He's not too old, but he sure is a hoot to hang with. Uhuh, he's in first grade, I think. Uhuh, you uh really oughta play, Stan. It's an awfully fun game. Ah I've never been to England, but uh I'll bet the people there are really nice.  They got those thick noses and all. Uh what is it? Is it something neat? Uh I wonder what it could be.  Hey, you know what we could do with these lady clothes, huh? Wuh-y why we could play Charlie's Angels. No, uh I get to be Jaclyn Smith. See, uh I thought of Charlie's Angels, and I get to be Jaclyn Smith 'cause I thought of it. Well, I don't know what our mission is. Do you know what our mission is, little first-grade kid? Hey, that's because we need Bosley. Uh Bosley always told the Angels what their mission was. Remember Bosley? Wah uhwhy uhwhy we need somebody to be Bosley.  Uh you just got- you just gotta tell us what our mission is, that's all. That's all Bosley does. Just give a mission, and us Angels will accomplish it. Well, what are we waitin' for? We've gotta find a way out of this room, by golly, or else we're gonna get drowned. Come on, Angels!  Dougie pushed that big box out of the way and found this old ventilation duct. And I reckon it's got to lead somewhere, and and it's good 'cause, uh 'cause now we won't drown. Upstairs? Uhwhy why there's ain't nothin' upstairs but adults. Uhwhy would we want to go upstairs for? So what's our mission now, huh Bosley? Uh wha what do you want us to do now, I wonder? Well, hooray! Come right on in here, Bosley. Huhwell, it was my idea.  Uh I got to thinkin', "Wuh, where do people keep TV sets?" and then I remembered that lots of grownups have TV's ih in their bedrooms. So, so I walked into Mr. Mackey's bedroom and er and sure enough, here it was. Wwe ain't got no more missions? Uhwhawhat are we supposed to do? We're Angels. Whawhat do Angels do without a mission? Hey, uhour parents aren't religious fantastics. Why, we gotta tell them that they're makin' an awful mistake, don't we? Huh how come they're actin' that way, Stan, huh? Uh how come they're laughin' and fallin' down and such? Uh let me handle this, Stan.  Whoa!  Hey, what are we gonna do, huh?! Ughuh uh they shot at us! They really shot at us! They, they ain't gonna stop until we're all dead, I betcha. Huh us and all our families. How come you slapped my face, Stan, huh? Why uhwhy on earth would you do that, anyways? Oh dear God, they're gonna set us on fire. Uhoh, great Jesus, son of Mary, wife of Joseph, what are we gonna do, huh? Huhoh, sweet Joseph, husband of Mary but not father of sweet Jesus- Uhuh, they're gonna burn us up and act like nothin' happened. Oh, sweet Jesus, Mary, mother of Jesus, wife of Joseph, father to Mary, well- Wait. Mary, wife uh... Oh, hold on. Wuh, no, I'm not sure. Uh-I'm not sure at all. Wha-what am I doin' again? Tha-at sounds awful dangerous. Wha-ah I don't know about this, uh. I think I'll reconsider. Yep uh I think reconsiderin' is the thing to do right now.  Uhuh, Mr. Reporter, sir? Uhuh wuhwe've got an eyewitness exclusive video for you, sir.  Uhuh oh uh, uh hooray, then! Uh we, we sure did. Why, we put the fear of God in those ATF sons of guns, I can tell ya. Uh, so you mean we can stay friends, Stan? Wouldn't that be swell, huh? 
Oowhy yu- you best do what he says, uh home-school kid. Why, this is our part of the playground, see? And uh, a-and if you don't follow our rules, whyuh, why we're gonna duct-tape ya to the bench.

Well, buh wuh when we pull our pants down,  should we stand frontways or back? I mean, do we show 'er our... behinds, or-ar our w-wieners?

Oowuh how are we gonna do that? Does it hurt?  I don't wanna do it if it hurts. Or if it... makes you get all sticky. Yeh-hah.

Dad's a good shopper all right. You mean, spy on him? Uh but... ain't that kind of like... fibbin'? Sure I do!   Uh, that's me!  Hm. Dad's going to see a movie. How nice.  "White Swallow Bath House"  Uh, that's me! I'm back, Ma! I sure did.  Dad sure had a nice night out. Well first, he went to see a movie. I don't know. But it wasn't the movie theater at the mall. No, it was that, really old theater downtown. The Studcat.  "Fisting Firemen 9"  I've never seen 1 through 8. Uh but it must have been a real short movie, though, because Dad came out, like, ten minutes later. ...And it must have been a sad film, too, because, he had a bunch of tissue paper with him when he came out. Poor old Dad, the movie really got to him. To the gym. Yeah. The White Swallow Spa. Yep. He went in there and wrestled with all kinds o' guys. He wasn't too good, though. This one black guy had him pinned down for fifteen minutes straight! Inspector Butters gets all the facts. I even got some neato pictures.  Oh, did you have a nice "trip," Mom? See you next "fall." Hahaha, yo- Ma?  Uh, that's me! Hm. Uh-I can't think of one.  Should I go see what he gets you again, Mom? Hey, a new paint brush. That's what Dad could get Mom for their anniversary. I gotta go tell him.   That's me! One please. Uh thanks!   Dad, you in here? Hello? Eh-anybody in here? Uh, Mr. Garrison?  Dad? Oh, uh, pardon me, sirs.  Hi Dad!  I'm glad I found ya.

Well, sure thing, Dad. Well, I know lying's bad, Dad. Y-you told me so. Little white lies? ...Uh, who's Jack? Oh no, that won't happen, Dad. Eh, no. Because I already told Mom and she's fine. A drive? Oh, boy!  I- I love a good drive. Is Dad comin' too?  Oh boy, a drive! Oh, jeez, you wouldn't have believed how angry I was when Teacher said I had to share my fingerpaints, because I've been sharin' them all along. Well, sure I do, Mom. I love you, too. Oh, you mean like the time you washed my mouth out with soap for sayin' "nutsack" in front of Grandma. Yeah, I need to behave myself. Well, sure, that makes sense, I suppose, yeah. Hey, did you seen my mittens anywhere?  It's cold out here. Oh. Well, alright, Mom. O-o-okay then.  Yep, I'm pretty sure the car is movin'. Looks like I'm headin' for the water.   That's me! Oh, boy! This thing ain't never gonna stop! I must be all the way down to Denver by now.  Wuh gee whiz, where the heck am I?  That's me!  That's me! And so then my friend started hollerin' at me, sayin' "you took my rubber bands." Well, I didn't take 'em, Craig, did. I saw Craig take 'em. Anyway, boy, I sure am lucky you came along, Mister. Oh. Hello? Uh, who is this? Uh, is this the Stotch residence? ...No.  ...No.  That's me! Sir? Hello? Wah I have to get to South Park. Eh, if you give me a ride, I could pay you the four dollars I made at the titty bar. I can't wait till Sunday. I'm eating with my family at Bennigan's tomorrow.

I- Ah, I'm sorry. The car just rolled into the lake, and it floated all the way down the river. I tried callin' home, but it was- I ain't grounded, am I? Lie? Hey, you stop hollerin'! It's your anniversary. Uh stop it, Mom and Dad. Now gosh darn it, you!  Well I ain't in trouble for hollerin' at ya, am I? ...Well ah, I'm happy you're alive too, Mom. So now can we go to Bennigan's?  Yeah! Yeah!   wait, what? Uh, k-kill me? Uh Jesus Christ! Yeah. Boy, you fellas are sure gonna rip on me at school now. I really wish I didn't know that stuff. I guess I learned that sometimes, lying can be for the best. Yup. Oh well, when I want a chipotle bleu cheese bacon burger at Bennigan's, I forget all about my dad... bein' queer and my mom tryin' to kill me. I'm gonna be okay. Naw, I'm lyin' Wuh comin', Dad!

I am Professor Chaos, and now, this puny world uh will bow down to me!  Kneel. Kneel before Professor Chaos!  Ah, the look on their faces when they got the wrong soup. I love bringing chaos!   It certainly is, Mother. Did ya hear about what's been goin' on? Some horrible new supervillain made somebody get the wrong soup order at Bennigan's. Yeh, you didn't?  Uh Dad, can I uh can I see the newspaper real quick?    So! You all think that you can outsmart Professor Chaos, do you?! Ms. Choksondik? Ah, I need to go to the bathroom. R-really bad.  Alright. I'm goin' to the bathroom now. If anybody needs me, ah that's where I'll be.  I am Professor Chaos! Bringer of destruction and maker of doom! Those who do not know me yet shall know me very soon, for the hour of Chaos ih-is at hand!  Oh! Ah, I'm back from the bathroom. Ah I really let one go in there. Why yes, I did. But he pushed me down and I scraped my elbow.  Yeesss. Go on and see the red mark on my elbow, the red mark I made myself to throw you off Professor Chaos's trail. It is almost ...complete. The creation of my minions who will assist me in bringing terror to the world.  Aaahhh! A note? Okay, Mom.  We haven't much time!  Oh I mean, my name is Professor Chaos. Very well. You called out Professor Chaos, and you also called out, eh your own demise!  come back minions. Join me? But why? Uh very well. You shall be my accomplice in evil. Together, we shall bring the world to its knees! A-and make all those who banished us from society run... red. Well sure you do. Ah I am professor, and you shall be my general. From now on you are General... Disarray. Now let us go look for my minions!  People of Earth! Your meaningless lives are about to end! I am Professor Chaos,  and this is my partner ih-in evil, General Disarray! In the past few days I have rained terror down upon the society that shunned me! And now it is time for my final Labor of Loathing! I am going to... flood... the world! Oh yes. Every living creature and every sacred building will soon be under leagues and leagues of cold and dark water. And there is nothing you can do to stop me! General Disarray, begin the flooding of Earth!  Our reign of terror is complete! Our tur- turmoil has now come full circle!  Oh. Alright then. Nothing to do now but watch the world die!  Boy, this sure is takin' a long time. Not long now, General Disarray, and... our horrible plan will be complete. Oh yeah. I hadn't thought o' that. That's a pretty good idea. I'll go get a hammer.  Heeyyy, what are you doin'?  Aaaah! You may have won this time! But I will be back!  but now they have left me with no other choice! This is it, General Disarray. My final solution.  Simple, my dear general. We are going to tear down the Earth's precious atmosphere! Oh yes! My latest plan will melt the polar ice caps, a-and burn all the world with the, with the... hu- sun's harmful rays!  
 Hey, fellas. How are things... going with your new best friend? Well ah, that's good. Good luck being their new friend, Tweek. I hope you'll do better than me. Well, see ya fellas.   Ah, my faithful companion in world destruction, General Disarray. Excellent, General Disarray! Now we can begin my most horrible evil plan yet to wreak havoc on humanity.  Simple, my dear general.  We are going to block out the sun! Oh yes! I have plotted for weeks, and figured that if we build a huge ...wooden shade eighty feet high, a-and fifty feet wide , precisely on this hill, South Park ...will forever be cast in a great shadow. Soon, all people will have to live like moles! They will love only to remember with sorrow how great the sun used to be!   Huh? He did? Hawww, heck. I thought I was bein' original. Aww, I don't wanna do it now  Uh Goddamnit, how come every time I think of something clever, the Simpsons already did it? General Disarray, are your parents home? Ah, I've done it, General Disarray. I've completed my most horrible deed to date. You know that big statue in the town square of pioneer John Wesley Powell? I snuck over there with a hacksaw and uh, and I cut off his head!  Hahahahaa, yeah! Hahaha, and they're probably just realizing that now! Quick! We must turn on the news!  Look! Look! I've made the news! I-I've wreaked havoc! I finally made the world sorry! I've brought sadness, a-and chaos! Oh. Uh-m, son of a bitch. Well why didn't you tell me the Simpsons already did that?  Stupid Simpsons... Wokay, how about this, Dougie?  No? Wokay , then I'm goin' to start a Web site to spread vicious ru-rumors about everyone in town! And and then I'll take their-  I'll bury a skeleton wearing angel wings so that the townspeople will think a fallen angel has fallen- Bring the World Cup to South Park so the... a huge soccer riot can destroy the-  Take all the beer cans in South Park and have them shaken up in a huge mixer at the paint store so that-  Dwaah!! I've done it, General Disarray. I've watched all one hundred and thirty-two episodes of the Simpsons, twice. And I've finally come up with something... tha they have never done! Uh, behold!  You've never ...seen this on the Simpsons, right? Good! Then l-let us take my machine outside and make society finally pay for sh-shunning us! Nnno , uh no, no, it can't be. No! No!  Aaaaah! Oh sweet Jesus! Aaah! Ah, Ah, Aaah! Nooo! Nooo! Waaaah!     Haaa! Cartman?  Aha! Ahaha! Ahahahaha! They did that on the Simpsons! Ha! Treehouse of Horror! Episode 4F02! The Genesis tub. Lisa loses a tooth, and the bacteria on it starts to grow, and makes a little society, and they build a statue of her thinking she's God! Ha! Hahaha! Really? So I shouldn't care if I come up with an idea, and the Simpsons already did it. It... uh...doesn't... matter.  Everything is back to normal, a, I think... I think I can go back to tryin' to destroy the world again.  
Compassionate. You mean, like a goldfish? 
  Wuuhh, it's really fun. You toss these little rocks at cars, and if the driver gets angry, you blame me. Cool!  That was the most perfect throw I've ever seen.  Me too!  Stupider than Bebe!

Uh well, sure thing, Stan. Eh, how come you care about schoolwork all of a sudden? Well, studying is the golden key to the imposing door of success. I know what you mean. I hate having my future self around, too. I said, I know how you feel. My life has gone completely downhill ever since my future self moved in. I hate him! All he ever wants to do is watch Becker. And that show is so stupid.  Oh. I guess it's been about four months now. Nobody asked. Probably watching Becker. See, here he is. Future Butters. Future self, this is my good friend,- Yeah. My future self has a bad kidney from all the drinkin' he did in high school.  Wha-, what are you lookin' for, huh Stan? Well we both got the same teacher for homeroom, too, but you didn't say anything then. I don't follow.   I don't think we're supposed to go in there, Stan. Maybe we should go adventurin' somewhere else. Oh. Well, you're good at adventurin', huh Stan?  Yeah, I can't believe it! This whole time! I wonder if my future self knows anything about this?  Hey, maybe my future self remembers this happening, a-and can shed some light on this subject. Eh, but then why did they come back to the past. Oh... Oohhhh.  But that's like they're lyin'. Ohhh, that makes me angry! Why, if Professor Chaos were here he'd make everyone pay! You know, Professor Chaos, bringer of destruction and disorder! Follow me back home, Stan. It's time I let you in on a horrible s-secret!  Wait right here, Stan. I warn you: you may not like what you're about to see.   Now you know my terrible secret! Huh? Naw, I'm Professor Chaos, Stan.  Mm. Uhm, maybe I used a little too much silver. How about this? Winter Park. It looks kinda nice. Wow, look at this, Stan.  "Are you sick of your parents? Do you want revenge for something they've done to you? Call the Parental Revenge Center of Western America for a free con-sul-ta-tion. Results guaranteed." Hey look, somebody lost their cat.

Hey Jimmy. Oh yeah, well, about that... Christopher Reeve came to town to do some kind of show, and everyone went to see ''him''. You know, Christopher Reeve, the guy who played Superman.

You know, it's not my parents I'm worried about. It's my girlfriend, Carrie. Why, she lives in Michigan. But when she finds out about this, woooo smokey, is she gonna be sore! She might even break up with me. And it would serve me right, too. Hi, Dad. Yeah. Well, he kept accusin' me for hours, and then he shot me up with sodium pentathol.  Officer, can I stay in jail, please? 
Mmuh well, not really, no.

[hums a bit; the worker arrives to see him sweeping] Woo-oo-ooooo-oo-oo, I just had to find my say to you tan...''  HAAAAGH! Who are you? Are you infected? You're not a cannibal, are you? Oh.  Oh good. You're a survivor, like me. Look, Mr. Dog, another survivor. And it's a lady, too. That means we ''can'' repopulate the earth. Yippee! I'm rebuilding society. Here, take a look.  I'm ready whenever you are. Hey, that's not very nice! This is my first society! I'm doin' my best!  Ma'am, can I use your phone?

Wow... a real-life relationship. Hi! Is Lexus here? Darling!  Oh God. I missed you so much.  Hey Lexus. Wuh it's me, Butters. I'm fine. I miss you though.  But I thought about you all day long.

Unh, I spent it all on Raisins the last six times. Oh, I really wanna see you too, baby. Eh don't, don't worry. I'll get more money Uh-okay. Uh, hey, Lexus, well, there's something I've been meaning to say.  Heeheee, heh, Oh my God. Dad, I need an advance on my allowance again. Uh but I spent it all. On my girlfriend.  Yeah. Yup!

Lexus, what are you saying? Are you saying... you don't want to be together anymore? So that's it? We're broken up now? Well go ahead and go. It's best we don't say anything more. There's nothing left to say. It's over.  Our relationship is o-over. Oh  Uh hey, hey Stan.  Well, mu mu mu girlfriend broke up with me. Yeah.  It sure does hurt. Uh, uhm no thanks. I I love life. Wuh-ell yeah, and I'm sad, but at the same time I'm really happy that somethin' could make me feel that sad. It's like,  it makes me feel alive, you know? It makes me feel human. And the only way I could feel this sad now is if I felt somethin' really good before. So I have to take the bad with the good, so I guess what I'm feelin' is like a, beautiful sadness. I guess that sounds stupid... Well, thanks for offerin' to let me in your clique, guys, uh but, to be honest, I'd rather be a cryin' little pussy than a faggy Goth kid. Well see ya, Stan.

You okay, AWESOM-O? Well, I have to take medicine for it every day. It's a little suppository I have to... put up my rectum. Hm, okay. Let's see  Oh, my parents don't know, but sometimes I get picked on by this one kid at school; his name is Eric Cartman, and he always tries to play jokes on me and stuff. No, he's not smart! He's just an asshole. And he's never gonna play a trick on me ever again!  Yeah, and he's never gonna get me again! 'Cause what Cartman doesn't know is that I know one of ''his'' secrets! When Cartman is playing all alone in his backyard, he likes to dress up like Britney Spears and pretend he's her! He sings and dances around with a life-sized cutout of Justin Timberlake. Yeah! And I videotaped him doing it! I've got the whole thing on tape! Even him making out with the Justin Timberlake cutout! Yeah! And if Cartman ever messes with me again, I'm gonna show that video to everybody! ''Then'' I'll have my revenge, boy howdy! Huh? Oh, I dunno. It's around here somewhere. Hey!

All right, I'll help you! Mrs. Cartman? This is going to seem very strange and, and you may not believe me, but, well, your son wanted me to tell you something. He says, he love you.  He wishes he would have been a better son sometimes. He he got caught, he got caught up in the rat race of, of taking things for granted. Kyle, Eric wants you to know that he's, he's sorry for all the times he made fun of you being a no-good stinking Jew.  He's asking for your forgiveness. And and he wants you to just remember the good times. He can't! Don't you understand?! God forgave the Jews, you should be able to forgive him! Uhh alright then.   Aww, that's okay, Eric. So I won't see you again? Wow. Yeh you're still here. Well, I guess saying goodbye wasn't enough. Well, well, you know, the preacher says that before your soul can be at peace, sometimes, you have to atone for something bad you did. Did you ever do anything really bad?  Broke fence... Boy oh boy, Eric, you've got a lot to atone for. Really. I mean, honestly, I don't know ''how'' you're gonna make up for all this. Does this mean... you have to go now? Oh jeez. I I guess maybe your soul is stuck here for a different reason. Eric! Calm down. I-I-it wasn't me! Ih it was the ghost!  So... the ghost ''was'' in my head. The whole time. Yes! Uh yes sir! I believe you.  AAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Please leave me alone, Eric. My bottom is really sore. Eric, ye-you're just an image in my head brought on by a traumatic event. Wuh I hate my stupid psychotic brain!  Hello, ma'am. May I talk to you? Well, there's this ghost, see? Only it probably ''isn't'' a ghost, ih-it's just a delusion brought on by my trauma. Well I'm supposed to heh, help him, find out why his spirit is wanderin' the Earth, even though I know that I'm most likely just completely insane. Really? Well, he's sittin' next to me right now. Hey, I think she could see you too. You really ''are'' a ghost. Go in there? Uh, but they'll see me. Eric.  Well, be careful, ghost pal. Hurry. Go, go!  Boy, we sure did. Yeah. Uh I feel that way too. I'll miss you too, ghost pal. Huh? Huh but I thought you ''were'' one! Oh hamburgers. 
 M'boy, did you see that first prize for the talent show? Why you must be excited! You'll probably win like always.  Hey, who's droppin' bombs in there?! How about a courtesy flush?! ''Lu Lu Lu, I've got some apples, Lu Lu Lu, you've got some too. Lu Lu Lu, let's get together, I know what we can do, Lu Lu.'' Oh! Oh hey, Jimmy.  I'm just practicin' for the talent show. Oh gosh, I'd never make fun of somebody with a problem.  Well sure I do. Yes, now sit down, Jimmy, we should have a little talk.  Then, the hard penis sneezes milk inside the lady's tummy, and after it's all done sneezin' milk, the penis stops bein' hard, and the man loses interest in the lady. That's right, Jimmy. ''Lu lu lu, I've got some...''

I was talking to Pete Wetchney, and he said that Danny Chadwick said that his sister told him that the girls in our class have a list that rates every boy's looks from cutest to ugliest. I dunno. I don't know. I-it's like a girl thing. They won't let anybody see the list but them.  You don't think they said I'm the ugliest boy in the class, do ya? Well if they did, my parents will ground me.  Well, I guess we're never gonna get that list from the girls.  Neat-o!  Okay!  They sure don't. You think maybe girls keep their balls on the inside of their tummies?  Mom, Dad! I'm not the ugliest kid in the class! Kyle Broflovski is! Whoopie!    
Oh no.  Poor Kyle. He's really taking it hard. Great benefit, Eric! Oh, uh-okay, it's clear. Okay, but... what are you going to do? I just uh... well I don't know if I should be helping you make Kyle look silly. I know, but are you sure Kyle has to be taught a lesson?  Oh yeah, uh-well I guess that's true. Wow, you really know what you're doing. 
 Man... Aw, poor girl.  Hey, hanguh, hang on, fellas, don't you think Britney's been through enough? I mean, maybe it's finally time for us all to just leave her alone.    Not me! I'm a squirrel!

But some people think you crapped on Teacher's desk, uh, to get out of the fight. That's what I said. I told everyone outside, "Cartman ain't scared of fightin' Wendy! He'd do it if he could!". That way it won't matter if you get detention. Man it's almost time for school to start an' Wendy still isn't here. Hehehe yeah, did you come up with that one on your own?! She chickened out!  She's coming! She's coming! But Wendy's coming to fight you. All right!  Fuck him up, Wendy! Well, yeah.

Mom, Mom, I gotta tell you somethin'! You're not gonna believe it! Oh no, what'd I do this time?  Oh jeez... I have no idea, sir. Uh, I'm sorry, Dad. I-It's just I've been really preoccupied lately. See, there are these kids at school, they were- A well-organized pantry. Well, okay, but, Dad, you've gotta listen to me. Kids at school are starting to change. They've been acting-   I- I'm Butters. O creatures of the night, I seek audience to engage with thee in unholy darnation and thus do... a-a-and thus do unto your bidding! Oh, uh... I wanna be a vampire. Yeah, I know, but uhhh, I think I would make a really good vampire if you just, well, just give me the opportunity. Yes! Yes, anything else? Soda and Cheetos, yes. I'll be right back. I have done what you've asked.  A case of Dr Pepper and Cherry Twizzlers. Who are you gonna give this to? I-I mean, vampires can't eat people food. Yeah, I guess. Well I'm sick of bein'- bein' pushed around. M-by my dad, by kids at school. Whoa. Oh, that tastes awful! Blagh, blagh.  I no longer need to explain anything to you, Father! You can't ground me! For I am neither living nor dead! How can thy ground that which is... ungroundable.  I am going to my room now! For I must slumber, per se.  Sorry, Eric, but I am a vampire now, and I can no longer survive on human food. And if someone must die so that I can feed, I choose thee.  I can't do it. Ah, I- I can't do it! I'm so hungry, but just, just remembering how that blood tasted before ju- blood is all clammy and tomato-y. It makes me wanna...   Ow. What have I done to myself? I should have known I wouldn't have the stomach to be a vampire. I am so hungry. Hey Dad.  I have to eat! But I can't do it. I'm getting weak. Dahhh.  Myah! Maybe not.  I want to help you. Some legends say that if you destroy the vampires' lair, the vampires go back to being human again. I can take you... to the place where kids are being transformed into vampires.  Two weeks ago. It used to be a Banaaana Repuuubliiic. They're putting an end to it!   I changed back! Goth kids burned down the Hot Topic, and sure enough, soon as they did I tried eatin' a hot dog and it tasted good. My vampire teeth even fell out when I bit into it. I'm human again! What's that, Dad? Uh oh. ''Aw, dang it![walks up the stairs to his room.]'' 
 Hey, you guys! You guys, I think we have a big problem!  Well, apparently Kenny has a girlfriend! Um, does Kenny like her? Oh, no. Oh, geez! Well, I just talked to Brad Dixon. Tammy Warner is bad news. All the fifth graders call her a slut, on account of she gave this kid Dave Darsky a B.J. in the parking lot of TGI Friday's. It's true! Ask anybody in fifth grade. "Tammy Warner is a total slut!" Hey, Jimmy, what's a B.J.?  Fellas! Hey fellas! I heard that Kenny is still going out with that slut Tammy Warner. Uh, what's that?  
 Hi, Grandma! Well,  why are we wearin' bedsheets and playing with squirrels, Kyle? Well Eric did.  Well don't worry Kyle. We're not gonna let people kill you. We'll keep you hidden forever! 
The day they're showin' Part 2 of last week's Terrance and Phillip show! This is gonna be great! Oh boy! Well it's on, it's on, itsonitsonitson! They, uh they aren't gonna show part 2 of the Terrance and Phillip show? They didn't show part 2 of Terrance and Phillip!  They replaced it with the Queef Sisters!  Oh God, oh my God no!  Ohhhhh ohhhhh.  Oh. Hey fellas. Aw thanks. Ohhhhh ohhhhh! My, my picture? 
Ohoho, there's Clyde. Do it to Clyde. Eric and Jimmy came up with the funniest joke ever.  Hey look, there's Kevin Stoley!   Hey look, Eric killed a dragon. Eric! Eric, you have to save us! An entire army of Jew robots!  
We can?  Whoa. Ahoy fellow club members. Congratulations on leaving your meaningless lives behind to become pirates.  Yeah! Neato! Pirates ho!   Oh jeez. Unh I don't know if I can really go through with this. It's just l-leavin' everything behind, uh, uh I can't believe I'm actually doing it. Huh, who, you mean you? No, I'm sick of it! He's right, lads. To adventure! Where's all the waterfalls and shi-and shipwreck lagoons? Uhh,  mahjey burazi? Oh. He-he says they're in there.  ARRRRRRGH! Okay!  Have a good day!   What's "port"?! One box of Italian passports. One necklace, gold. Three crewmember watches. Oh. Uhuh sure, Galeed. Well, 'cause our lives sucked back home! We had all these rules and homework. And our parents hollered at us! So we wanted to come here and be pirates. Huh? Jeez. Guess we kind of got put in our place, huh Ike? Yeah, me too.  Eric! Hey Eric. Listen, we wanna go home. Me and Ike, well, we've been talkin' and, well guys, we really had it pretty good back in America. I mean, sure, it's easy to think our lives are boring and full of rules, but a lot of people have it way worse. The pirate's life isn't a life of fun and adventure, it's a life of hardship and suffering. When you get down to it, well we were pretty lucky to have the lives we did.  
I'm a dork, and I deserve what's coming to me.  Ow. Fellas, my underwear is so far up my buttcrack my legs are numb!  Uyeah, I guess I deserve it. Uugh! So what?!  So I'm almost nine years old and anyone who hasn't kissed a girl by fourth grade is a dork! Sellin' kisses? You mean I'm... gonna kiss a girl... today? Oh boy, I sure am nervous. Uh, how come? I gotta do this! I gotta know what it feels like! Oh boy... Oh jeez, oh, stay calm Butters... Eh, how was it? I'm going!  Oh, hi. So ummm yeah, ah, I was hopin' maybe I could get a kiss. Yeah, cool, uhhhm... umuh... okay.  Oh, money... Rrright.  Thank you!   Hey, I know. Hey fellers! Fellers, do you like gettin' kisses? 'Cause I know a girl that'll give you a great kiss for just five dollars! Sure, Scott! Even if you got diabetes!  Boy oh boy, this sure is great! I've been thinkin', Sally: I could probably drum up some third grade customers if you could do kisses before school too. We could make double the money. Aww nuts!  Well, I did have another idea. What if we got another girl to fill in for you sometimes? Well, you know, we bring someone on, show her what to do, and then share all our money together. We could have our very own...  kissin' company. The next key to a successful business is "innovation." I think maybe we need to understand that some boys simply can't afford the five dollars for a kiss, so what if we start also charging just two dollars for a hug? Why thanks. Sally, I think your position behind the temp building at recess is perfect. Megan, I'm thinkin' about moving you to the baseball field after school during little league practice. I got a kissing booth set up at the kids' fair on Saturday so Kayla and Ashley, you take turns there. Any girl that sells more than twenty kisses gets  a little sunshine, but if you don't show up for work at all, I'm afraid you get a stormy cloud. Hey fellas. Would anyone like a coupon? We're offerin' two for one kisses today through Thursday. Yep! I am founder and head CEO of the Butters Kissing Company. Just look at this.  I'm tellin' ya guys, this is the most genius idea I've ever come up with. A lot of boys would pay to kiss my employees. ...A pimp. Huh... Bohy, Kyle was right, Sally. There's guys with kissing companies all over the country. "The person managing all the women is known as the 'pimp,' while the working women are referred to as 'ho' or 'bitch.'" Oh, you're a bitch, Sally.  Hey, look at this! There's about to be a big pimp convention, it looks like. I gotta get to that convention, Sally. I could learn all kinds of stuff for our company.  Hi there. My name is Butters. This sure is a nice convention, huh? Yeah, I'm just starting out. I really came last minute 'cause I was hoping to learn more about being a successful pimp. Yeah, just about a week now. I have four girls at the moment, but I feel like I could be doing a better job. What's the game?  Yes I- I know what you are saying. You don't have to keep asking. I know what you're saying.  Yeah! I believe I know what you are saying! Hey Dad! Aw hell Dad, I got lots of girlfriends. Sally's just my bottom bitch.  Boy oh boy, really great work, bitches. You all sold lots of kisses today. Except for you, Megan, I'm afraid you get a stormy cloud sticker today. I just hold on to all the money, 'cause bitches can't be trusted with it. We pool all the kissing money together, see? But if you wanna buy anything, you just talk to the bottom bitch  Do you know what I am saying?  Yo, Bebe. Bebe yo. Bitch you wanna make some motherfuckin' money? Bitch you should be doin' kisses on the playground. You can make fifty bucks a day! Buy all the purses and shoes that you've ever wanted. I'll treat you right, bitch. Oh, alright then.  Bitch, don't you wanna start makin' some real fuckin' money? Why you were made for the playground, bitch. You should be out there workin'. Don't you want a new lunch box? Nice new coat? I can get all that for you, bitch. What? Oh. Well all I'm sayin' the bitch should be out there workin' is all.  Whatcha doin' bitch? Just givin' kisses to Stan for free? Why you should be makin' some motherfuckin' money!  Clyde, here's a hundred bucks. If Stan comes near me, punch him. Come on Wendy, you should be puttin' that mouth to work. All these bitches are kissin' fellers, and they haven't figured out that they can be making some serious fuckin' money! Really glad you joined the company, Annie! Now remember: you're chargin' five dollars for a kiss, two for a hug, and six for half and half. Alright bitch? Alright, how about a freebie?  Sure, Kyle. Kyle, every boy pays for kisses. Do you know what I am saying? If you've got a girl, and she kisses you, sooner or later you're paying for it. You've gotta take her out to lunch, take her to a movie, and then spend time listenin' to all her stupid problems. Look, look at Stan right there.  He's gotta sit there and listen to her stupid motherfuckin' problems 'cause she kisses him. If you ask me, that's a ''lot'' more than the five dollars my company charges. What happened is that I became a man! I'm sorry I'm not your little buddy anymore, but there's a time people have to grow up!  And that's... three thousand dollars today for Charise.  REALLY great work, bitch! That is another...  sunshine sticker for you.  Mmmwhoa boy! And so, I would like to see if there are any housing loan opportunities for some of my employees, and also what kind of corporate tax I should be filing under. It's a kissing company. Oh sure! My black employee Charise over there, one time she made two thousand dollars, on one customer! Can you believe it? Two thousand dollars just to kiss a feller. She currently stays in a motel room, 'cause a lot of her customers see her late.  You wouldn't believe the time of night some fellers wanna kiss. 'Course. My bottom bitch keeps a database of all our customers, specially the VIPs, like Senator Morris. Sure! Senator Morris gets kisses every day at lunchtime. You know where he likes to get kissed? In a motel room. Darnedest thing. He must get sleepy. Huh? Why? But I heard ACORN helps pimps and their bitches! Heey! Mr. Daniels! You get kisses from my bitch Roxy in the alley behind Sizzler.  Boy, how do you like that, bitches? Approval for two housing loans and tax-exempt status. File these away, Sally.  Whoa whoa, bitches, bitches! Oh. Well we operate on a sixty-forty split here. Bitches have access to Medicare and now, low-income housing loans. What's that? Well wait, hold on now. Why I'd never get in the way of somebody being happy. Well us pimps gotta be good. Even to each other. Wha? Awww.  Gals. Gals, could you all come gather round? Gather round, gals; take a knee.  Gals, I... well I'm afraid I can't do this anymore. I'm gonna be leavin' the company. Well I enjoyed being your pimp and all, it's just that... when I see real love, like what those two people have, well, well it just makes me feel like a... well, like a dick. Well I may be a man now, but it doesn't mean I have the right to be earnin' money for what girls do, whether you're chargin' fellers for kisses by cash or by makin' them listen to your stupid motherfuckin' problems. Well that's your hard work. Bitches, this is your company now, so get out there, and make yourselves some motherfuckin' money! 
Yes! Yehhehehes! Ohhh. Yeah, that makes sense. Let's do this! Triceratops! I got, half a mind to report, r-report you to the police, sir!  Okey doke. Hmboy, wrestling sure is fun! Hey! No! No, the fight hasn't started yet. No, bad. Now hold on! I am stopping the fight!  Eoh! That's because your mother betrayed my mother, Juggernaut! Yeah! No way! I'm freaking out... Juggernaut! There is to be an Ultimate Smackdown this Saturday! Are you going to run from that as well? No Irene, please! Just this once, do not abort this baby! Stay out of my business Sergeant Hammerclaw! You just stay out of my way!  Are you sure? He's closer to a panther than you'll ever be! 
Hey Stan! I heard you were looking for people who care about the Japanese slaughterin' whales. Nononono, I got stuff to do. But I wanted to tell you there's these fellers on TV. They go out in the ocean an' try to stop the Japanese wherever they are. I watch their show all the time. And, they take volunteers. 
What are you guys talkin' about? Harleys are neato! I always thought, someday when I grow up I'm gonna get a Harley. Then people will have to notice me, and they'll have to deal with my shit for once. The open road! The wind on my face! I'll go from city to city! Rowrrowrroowwrr! Everyone lookin' at me! "Who's that guy? He must be a Hoo- he must be tough!" Vromvrom, vromvrom, vrooom! I'll have my girl on the back seat holdin' on to my fat belly - sure she's missin' a few teeth, but she thinks I'm coool. That's why, when I grow up, I'm gonna be a Harley rider! It does? Okay.   You fellers never got what these people are really about! Freedom! Rebellion against the system! A living image of independence! Solid, defiant, and supremely cool, the biker is an All-American icon of resilient individuality and freedom. I'm not a fag yet, sirruh but a but I am bike-c-curious. 
Oh jeez! Hey Wendy! Wendy! Is it true? That you hate Smurfs? Hey now! Me and us fellers were just asking questions!  It is true! What did the Smurfs ever do to you! Ya bitch! I just called the president a bitch. Hey Eric! Oh you bet! I love all the stuff you said about how our school president never does anything, and how she's changing everything. Cool, thanks.   Yeah, and she hates Smurfs! Whoa...  That does it! Our student council is corrupt and has to be dealt with! We need to get all the kids together who wanna fight back and tell them to meet after school! We will forever remember this day, the day we finally stood up to Wendy Testaburger! I don't know about all of you, but I have had enough! We've been sitting back and watching as our school slowly goes into the toilet! But today, we do something about it!  Let us not forget what happens this day! We are here, Wendy Testaburger!  I am. The students want answerrrrs! Go on the Morning Announcements if you've got nothing to hide! Wah!  Answer for your crimes on the Morning Announcements! Ohhh, he's got her now! She's speechless! All right! Cartman's president. We did it. 
What do you guys wanna do first? I hear they have a new inner tube slide.  Okay, thanks.  You said "go ahead". Yeah, come on, Kyle, I'm not the only person who's peed in the pool. Lots of people do. You bet! The who? Whoopie!  Oh b-hoy, the waves are startin' up again! Come on, Kyle! Yeah, if anything you should wash your hands ''before'' you touch your weiner!  Do you need to wash your hands? You said you could hold your breath the longest, Kyle. Well yeah, seeing all that running water always makes me ''need'' to pee. Please, Kyle, I wanna go home. You can do it, Kyle!  Hawww, you lived? What's this? 
Holy moly, what's that between the lady's legs? It's all bushy.  I've never seen that part of a lady! Do they all got a hedge like that? Do they??  Did you see that bush on that lady?? What the heck was that?? Gee whiz, it was like almost up to her belly button! Oh no! It was just... so big and bushy sir. Why does it look like that? Oh no. I don't wanna have to buy a Batman costume. There! It was like that! It looked just like that!  Just like this, buh, but smaller, and right in the place where her underwear should've been. If I trim it down, it'll look right..  But this is what I keep seeing in my head!  No, uh, if I can just see it again, I, I'll be fine. Haah! Leave me alone!  Me, I just... Well I just can't stop thinking about bush. I mean it's like, what is it? What does it mean? Why would there be a bush right there? Is it a live bush? Are there berries? Oh good, 'cause I really can't take it anymore. Yeah, it feels great! I never wanna see bush again!  I finally paid a lady to show me hers. You wanna know what's under that bush? Nothin' but a pair of sick Joker lips. 
Kill John Lennon...  Hey dad, where does John Lennon live?  Oh hey fellas. I'm just watching the Kardashians. Kim Kardashian is sooo sexy. Her butt is like a biiig mountain of pudding. I am? Oh no. Which book was that? I don't even remember that.  But it all makes sense now. Ever since I read ''The Catcher In The Rye'' I've been having these... blackouts. Crazy thoughts of wanting to kill the phonies. I must have channeled all my angst into dark writings in my sleep! Yeah, though I barely remember it, but I know I did. Huh?  Oh, thanks. I wrote that.  Thank you!  That's nice.  Just enjoying myself. Why, Eric? But, you told me I did! Yeah, I'm broooding. No, let me tell you somethin', fellers! You always take advantage of me, and after reading ''The Catcher in the Rye'', I've learned you're nothing but phonies! I'm not letting you trick me this time! So the four of you can just suck on my wiener! I have to come right to my room after school. Not yet, but as soon as I'm not grounded anymore, I'm hopin' to meet Kim Kardashian. I wanna jump on her belly. Uh... yeah, pretty much, I think, think so. Oh, is that who the book was tellin' me to kill? Ohhh.  Kill Ronald Reagan. Oh really?  Oh yeah, gosh dangit. Well, it's kind of about love and betrayal! The inner workings of the human mind! Oh it's raunchy alright! I know what my readers want, and I'm going to deliver! Sorry Dad, I was just bein' the voice of a generation.  I know.  You think I care about that? My writing got the most beautiful woman in the world killed! I loved her! And now she's gone and it's because of me! Thang, thanks, fellas. I'll definitely never write again. I think I can get through this. What? What?! Oh no! Aw. Aw I got her killed too? Aw uh, oh well, at least she was ugly.  
Hey, Stan, isn't that Tom Cruise? How come you're packin' fudge, Mr. Cruise? 
 Why I, I just don't wanna watch him kill himself... I don't even know who he is anymore!  Mm but then Towelie just kept gettin' more and more high, and he got kicked out of the house.  Towelie! Open the door! Towelie, I gotta take you somewhere really important! Um come on, Towelie, it's, it's right over here.  Towelie, over the past couple of years, I have seen drug addiction affect you in the following ways. You're not the towel you used to be.  Where, as you used to be fluffy and absorbent, ye-you now are crusty and.... and unable to absorb the smallest amount of water. Will you get help today?  Towelie! We aren't the only ones in this intervention who've been hurt by you! He needs you to get better, Towelie. Please.  You will? 
Hey Eric. Ahhh well oh- kay. Eeyeah, I'm psyched.  I'm really psyched! Yeah! Yeah let's do this alright?! I'm pumped I'm psyched! Alright. Yeah. NASCA- NASCAR? You're givin' away all your money?? You sure you want to do this?  Hey Eric. Yep. You don't have a penny left.  How come you're hangin' upside down? Feel stupid yet? All those ladies have stinky vaginas? Gee-whiz, there's Vagi-everythings. Wuh- uh I'm buyin'? But but I uh, I uh, I didn't bring any money, I didn't know I had to buy Vagisil. No, you're good.  Really? That was fast. Excuse me. Mr. Evans, sir?  Your uh, your wife is on the phone and- uh, well- she just got raped. Yeah, she got, she got raped a lot and uhhh- and you gotta go talk to her.  Eric, are you sure you can do this? I think you gotta press the gas pedal. There's like a long pedal on the floor by your right foot.  Eric? Eric, uh you were as poor and stupid as you could be. Eric! Don't ever talk like that! How bad is it, doctor? Well at least there's that. Did you hear that, Eric? See? You are really stupid. It has to be, Eric.  Eric, where are you going? You seemed really stupid, Eric. Obama's fuckin' gay. Pissin' me off! Yeah, he's a champion alright. Be careful up here about a hundred yards, Eric. There's a wrecked car on the right side.  You're gonna wanna watch for it here. You're gonna wanna watch it over on the right side. That's fuckin' gay as hell. There you go. You're back on the track. Oh man, now our friend Kenny's tryin' to break the windshield. Ain't that just gay as hell?  I know. That pisses me off. That's fuckin' gay.  Huh? Uh, but- but you- you said I had to  But you said to take your money so I took it by  Ah I don't know. 
Kyle did that? Gee whiz. Are you being serious? Yeah, but lockin' Kyle in a meat freezer? I mean, he could die. Sounds like it wants smoosh smoosh! 
Hey, Stan, I have a note for you. Yeah, uh, Wendy said to give you this.  
And so then, and so then it turns out the Terminator secretly had a kid, ten years ago. Meaning Terminator could be his own father. And then Skeletor gets angry and wants to fight him.  Skeletor is real?? Skeletor's a lady?? Hey Eric. Is that really all our wiener sizes? Butters Stotch, 2.2 inches. Is that good? A conspiracy? Whoa, it's a little chilly in here. Hey wait, the cold is making it shrink some. Where're you going, little feller? Hang on, he's coming back out. There he is. Who's a little guy? I'm hung like a horse! Homework! I just don't get it! That is the fourth time I've calculated, and it's below average! I thought I was hung, but according to my T.M.I., I have a micropenis!  I don't understand it! An' I'm startin'- uhh, I'm starting to feel angry! Rawr!   Oh what's the point, Mom?! What's the point of life anyway?! All you do is yell at me! And the government... wuh, which is led by fascists, and everyone's a Justin Bieber wannabe. I wanna go and drive a Hummer, that's what I wanna do! I wanna drive a car that goes, that goes rawr rawr rawrawrawr! 
 Every single night. Slash is make-believe?? Well what the heck do we do now? I know. It's messin' with my head so hard.

Oh well, sure, uh he's the bringer of destruction and evil! What? Why would I do that? Me, Butters. Sir, I'm confused. Really? Pardon me? Yes!  This... is Butters. It's Wednesday night at 9 p.m. From what I understand, there are people living inside my head and they want to kill me. It must be true, because now every night I wet the bed. So tonight I'm gonna leave the camera on to see what exactly I become while I am sleeping. Oh man, this is freaky. Like that movie ''Paranormal''.  Goodnight, Butters. Goodnight, Butters. Hmm. Alright, I guess I'm goin' to fast-forward.   Mom! Dad! I wet the bed again! Oh, sweet jumping Jesus!  Uh, yeah, Dr. Janus, I wanted to give you something. You remember how you told me if I got myself on video it might help me with my problem? Well yeah ah, I saw you pissing in my face. Huh? Well no, ah I just thought it was one of your other personalities trying to give me a- This is illegal. We could get arrested.  Oh Jesus! I'm trying, sir!  What? But you said to uh, but I got to uh, and then, you told me tuh... That does it, you hear me?! I am through with all of you! No more Postman Butters, No more Inspector Butters, no more Porn Star Butters, no more Professor Chaos, and no more-   Um, excuse me? Wahh! Please, Billy, ah I'm just a kid too. I can't help you. What?? No! You told me NOT to play Inspector Butters! It's okay, Billy, we're gonna get to the bottom of this. Well alright, Watson, well let's find out what we need to and get out of here! Hah? Aw man. Oh, come on! AAAAAAAAAAA!  AAAAAAAAAAA! Waaaa!  Thanks. I'm just glad the whole thing is over and done. Maybe now poor old Dr. Janus can finally get the help he needs. 
Yeah! Open mine first Stan! It's the red one!  I know how you like Legos. Happy birthday! 
Do the girls get their shots right in the vagina? You mean little hamburgers grow in your butthole? Well ''I'' don't want burgers comin' out of ''my'' butt! Jeez, we're out of finished burgers again, Eric. We need more.  
Fellow Meheecans! This time, we're gonan try rushin' the Texans from the left side! Do not give up home, for I am Mantequilla! Viva la Meheeco!  Oh, what, I'm not a good Meheecan?  Boy, I've really done it this time. I have one simple direction: "Go that way." How did I end up getting lost? My amigos were right: I ''am'' a lousy Meheecan. They're all living the good life while I'm, while I'm stuck out here in Meheeco. I am... The Last of the Meheecans.  Por favor, ehe, I have to get across the border. M-mis amigos, my a-, my amigos are waiting. I, am Mantequilla, the last of the Meheecans. <poem><i>Work, Mexican, Work.  Work, Mexican, Work</i></poem> Wow! A present just for me?  Ah, sí señor. <poem><i>All week long, bossman say</i></poem> <poem><i>Sing your Song, earn your pay</i></poem> <poem><i>Meheecan</i></poem> <poem><i>Meheecan, it's your</i></poem> <poem><i>While people play in the sun all day</i></poem> Hey, where are you going? Ma'am, can I, can I just use your phone? So there I was, just yards away from the American border. All my amigos made it across, but I became lost in the woods. If the Whipples hadn't come along, I might have froze to death. But I'm not giving up, for I, am Mantequilla!  Nothing can stop me, and my pride, in Mother Meheeco! Hey! You fellas think you can get me across that border? All my amigos are there, waitin' for me. Viva la Meheeco! We're crossin' the border! Olé! Oh uh, I'm sorry,  I don't really- Wow. Thanks everyone.  It's really kind of made me... appreciate my amigos back home. I know they were waitin' for me, and I'm sure they're all worried sick.  ...What did he say? Ah I actually don't speak Spanish.  Game on!  AAAH! AAAAH!    Haha! Heheeheeheehahaheehee! Base!  So then, so then the fireman says "That won't even ''fit'' in my scrotum!"  Boy, I'm so glad I proved I'm a good Meheecan! Hey, maybe next time I can be team leader! 
Eavesdropper?  Hey! Pete Melman pooped his pants and uh had to have his mom bring him new undies! It's megasuperhilarious!  NO Wikileaks! Bad! Biggest story about who? There he is!  Hang on, Lemmiwinks! Look! I think Lemmiwinks killed him!  
Ehe, and so then, Skeletor told Terminator he wanted a divorce, and apparently it's all gonna be finalized soon. Uh but, then, why does his face look like that?  Hey, you know? Eric is right. Maybe we ''should'' form a 99% club. Sir, we believe your fitness system is flawed, and that for 99% of us, it is unfair. Sir, all of the students already know who the 1% is. I sure hope this works. Hey, what are you fifth graders doing? Yeah, how can the 17% be sticking it to the 83%? 
Oh neato, huh fellas?  Thanksgiving is about murder? Okay Dad. 
Yep. To find out who the poorest kid is, I actually was able to see which kids in school got those coupons they hand out for school lunch. So then I cross-referenced all the kids who were on half-priced lunches with the tax records of people in town to see which kids' parents actually made the least amount of money last year. Well actually, Eric, it's you.  Now that Kenny's gone,  I'm sorry, pal. Uh, I won't tell anybody. 
 Oh jeez, that's embarrassing. My grandma is from Virginia.  A-ha! I told you you should sit on it that way! I told you! 
  Sorry. My arms hurt.  We aren't makin' that much, fellas. Oh sorry, sorry.  Sorry!  
 Equipment is flying in, ten seconds. AAAA!!! AAAA!!! AAAA!!! What?! You mean you guys still plan on Faith Hilling after what we just saw? Well, count me out. Well, I'm scared.  Oh, that's okay. I think... HA?! 
 Hoh da lolly! This is gonna be so much fun! You mean it's like, like a monster? AAAAAAHHH!  ''Lu lu lu, lu...'' N-no such thing as J-Jewpacabra. People made it up.  It's -- that's okay. Even if there was a J-Jewpacabra it couldn't get in my r-room anyways. AAAAAHHH! No, it's a school night! You think Jewpacabra is here? Oh good. Maybe we scared it off? Oh God, I'm scared. Eric, stop it! I'm not saying Jesus is a lie! Jesus is a lie? Nope. I don't think... Christ has any basis in reality. Oh, hamburgers. It's all quiet out front, Eric. He says he's not payin' us to scratch our buttholes.   Hey, Eric. Well, we got scared so we're next door at Wingstreet.  Yeah, well it was the closest place to hide.  
 OH.  Uh, it's okay. Um I'm not hungry anyways. ...Yeah.  Naw, I'm not a tattle-tale. Naw, I'm not no Anonymous Andy. Naw, I don't want kids calling me a Cliché Conflict Resolution Kevin. My Grandma? Grandma, ca-can I talk to you for a second? Could I maybe talk to Grammy alone? I just...  don't want you to pick on me no more, Grandma. Um, I don't think I'm tough... grandma. No, you took it all!  My grandma?? Oh hamburgers!   HA! OH. Ah. Hi Grandma. Well I didn't narc, Grandma. It wasn't me. Nno Grandma, knock it off! No! Stop it!   Yes... Can I, can I not do this, please?  I don't wanna do this. Mm, but this is just gonna make things worse for me. Nnothin' Dad. Jjust a little gassy.  Okay Dad, I won-aaaaah! Gaaaah-ow.  HAAAAA!   Oh uh, nothin'. Uh stop... Stop trying to make me say things I don't want to on your TV show.  Please, leave me alone. No it doesn't. Stop it! Grandma? I did it, Grandma.  
 AAAAH, fellas!  Guess what Larry Barsky just told me?!  Guess! There's a new girl that started school here today. And she's joined the cheerleading squad. Look, look, there she is.  How come? Are you sure, Eric? I mean, maybe they just aren't meant for each other. Oh hey, Nichole? Coach wants you to take these to the boys' locker room.   It's gonna be okay, Eric. They'll find love somewhere else. Yes, they will. In... In who, Eric? 
Boy, I just don't get football. Guess that's why I suck at it. That's true. Old Eric tells me I should work at a Thai massage parlor, I'm so good at sucking. I got the balloon, Coach Marsh. Err, what should I do with it? Okay! Hey, hey, heh excuse me. Pardon me. Heh,  you guys look terrific. Wow, this game is great! Hey, whoa! Well I can't believe what I'm hearing!  We've been practicing and gettin' ready for this game, and you fellas just wanna quit?! This great game isn't about plays. It's about sportsmanship. And compassion. And when I look around this locker room, well I see some of the nicest, most compassionate guys I've ever met!  And Clyde! Well you give better hugs than anyone out on that field! Are we just gonna let North Park walk away with a victory because we think they know how to be nicer than us?  Bein' nice is about what's inside you! When your enemy is nice to you, you just be nice right back! And if they give you two balloons, well you give them three! And when they try an-and ''thank'' you for those balloons, you say "Ah I don't need any thanks! I did it 'cause it was the right thing to do!" And then you give them a smile! And when that other team tries to cover you, well that's when you gotta reach deep down. Right down to your creamy center. Well that place, well that place inside of you where, where all the gooey happy-lovin' goo sits and you just gotta use that and be the nicest, most compassionate player you've ever been, and let the world know that we will not fall down so easy! Huh? Oh jeez n-no, I I don't know, fellas. Yeah, but I uh, I I can't be team captain. I... Well I suck at everything. 'At's in there. It's overflowing sometimes.   Woohoo''hoo''hoohoo! Wuh wuuuhhh wuh!   I was havin' happy dreams, about a girl and-!  Okay Dad!  Wuh sure, Eric.  Uh-uh oh, no E-Eric, you're, why you're a great player. Oh, well, ye-Eric, ah I told you: everyone has a creamy filling inside them, where all the feelings of compassion and joy come from. Oh, didn't your dad ever tell you that? ...Oh right, I, I'm sorry. Well, everyone has a creamy filling, Eric. And and some people have so much of that filling that it, that it comes out sometimes. A lot of times, when I go to sleep, and especially if I've had them wonderful dreams that make me feel really good, sometimes I wake up, and when I wake up, I I realize some of my goo has come out.  But I always make sure I keep it, just in case I ever run out of all my sunshine happy feelings. My goo doesn't come out every night, but I sure do seem to have a surplus of it.  I don't know. Weh I never really thought of it that way.  Do you feel warm and compassionate? All right, first string, cover those wideouts. Tell 'em how much you like their outfits! Clyde, Tolkien! Hug those two players and give their quarterback a kiss.  Stay positive, Stan! All right guys, cuddle up, cuddle up!  Now what is goin' on out there? Oh, all right. Well all right, here you go.  Like me! 42! Red 13! Sunshine and happy thoughts! Sunshine and happy thoouughts! HUT!   Mr. Marsh, listen. I know you care about your son, but he's a heck of a player! He's good at tickling, laughing, and getting along. What's sarcasm and what's cum?  DAD! Hey, Dad! My wiener is all stiff and pointy! Thanks, Dad. 
Leave me alone! Get out of here, all of ya!      I don't know, Dad, ah I was just pissed off, I guess! I don't suppose it is, but I don't give a darn! Why don't you shut up, Dad, and stick it in your ear, for cryin' out loud!  It's not?! Yeah?  Hey yeah, all the time. Will somebody tell me what the frickity fookshmere is goin' on?! Uhbu-but I'm from here. We're from Hawaii? But what does being Hawaiian have to do with me acting like an emo chick on her period? They won't let me on the plane. Why, I can't do anything right!  I'm not intoxicated, you skank! I'm just "deligerent" because of my hapanuanalua! Can't you see I'm in horrible pain?! Do you have any idea what-?!  Uh yeah, I uh, I'm not sure where I'm supposed to go? Oh, ah, I'm not a tourist. I'm a native Hawaiian.  Yeah? Oh thi-this is my friend, Kenny. Oh please, i-if it weren't for him I couldn't have come. You folks are all native Hawaiians too? What's "saimin"?  Whoa, it's like gasoline!  Hey, uh now I do feel butter, uh better. I've never done this before.  Aim... my anger! Stupid   No! Kenny's my friend! He's the only kid at school I actually like, you buncha jerks! He won't betray us! Will you, Kenny?! Kenny, be careful! Kenny! Well I don't know about the rest of ya, but I'm sick and tired of bein' pushed around all the time! I came all the way down here for my hapa noa ceremony, and I can't even have it, 'cause the fucking haoles have to ruin everything! Well if you ask me, the only good haole is a dead haole! With a, with a stick up his butthole, and his wiener cut off! Rraahhhh!  Stupid! Greedy! Haoles! Kill! Them! All!  Surrender?! No, the heck with that! Well I won't do it, you hear me?! I'm not licking anybody's... testes! No! This is our home! And I'm sick of everyone who thinks they're better than me just 'cause they've got good looks, and just 'cause, even after massacring Daredevil, they happen to come back and hit a home run that everyone likes! You shouldn't be able to be good-looking and be with Jennifer Lopez and be a good director!  All right all right fine! ''Argo'' is a good movie! There, I admitted it! I told people that it didn't hold up, but it holds up god darn it! Ben Affleck has everything, GRAGH!  Yeah, I guess so. Except it still doesn't change the fact that Ben Affleck gets to be handsome, talented, and then gets to go home and kiss Jennifer Lopez. What? Really? But I thought I was totally jealous of him. He's just married to Jennifer Gardner? Oh my God, I feel so much better.  Yeah, ogh, I like that Ben Affleck guy. He's a good filmmaker. Come on, Kenny, I guess I owe the kids at school an apology.  Did you see ''Argo'', Kenny? It's a pretty good movie. Ben Affleck has a lot goin' for him. Not everything, but a lot. Whoopie! 
Oh hey Eric and Kenny. You guys don't have costumes? I'm a wereprechaun. You know, a leprechaun that's been bitten by a werewolf. And Jimmy's Gangnam Style. Come on! What are you guys goin' as? That sure is a great Gangnam Style costume, Craig. I'm a wereprechaun. You know, a leprechaun that has been bitten by a werewolf.  Oh wow! Nice costume, Stan. It's Gangnamstein! Okay, Stan. Enjoy the Monster Mash.  Kyle! Kyle! It's Stan! He's dying.  
Yeah, and so, and so then, I asked Preacher, "Well, what about the New Testament?" And he says, "Well you still should oughta read it, but you're gonna need to put an asterisk next to Jesus' name whenever it comes up." Yeah, Stan. Didn't you hear Jesus did all his miracles on drugs?  Well yeah.  I donno. I got mine down at 7-11.  He's the one person who doesn't do stuff like that! Why don't you leave him alone! Who? Ooo, look at him go, Stanning his ground! Go Stan! ...A little unnecessary, but go Stan! Prostitute!  Hey Stan, well, some people are sayin' that you knew what you were doing all along. That, that you, you cut off your wristband on purpose to shed light on the Belarusian farmers. Yeeah. Is it true? Heyah, whatever Stan. Yeah I thought you were a butthole,  Wu-what sound? 
Well, mmmaybe Cartman had a good reason. Huh? Wha? NO. Uhuh, why? He didn't tell me nothin'. Annd I'm sworn to secrecy. Ih-it's really important, Kyle, and it isn't what you think.  Uh, don't make me say any more! I can't! Don't you see?!  Don't make me swallow this! Wa-I'll do it  It's an almond M&M. Ah-I'm very allergic to almonds. Please, just leave me alone. Well... hah... HWAAAH!  Ah! Bah! I hate almonds.   What's up fellas? Bleh, ogayedmi. AGH! No! Please! You can't! Okay! Okay! He's helping the Chinese get something they want. Because the Chinese actually want to protect something that's important. At Red Robster.   Red Lobster!  Red Lobster!  Red Lobster! I didn't say anything. I promise. Please, Eric! I tried to be quiet, I swear! 
Ww-ww-what's the N-S-A? The government watches everything we do? Hello?? Hey Government... It's me... Butters. Ah I just wanna say, well, well, thanks for watching over me and, and doin' everything you do. ...An and please watch over Mommy, and Daddy, ah an and my friends Stan and Kyle, Craig and Tolkien, and and even ol' Eric Cartman. Uh I know he can be a meanie sometimes, but please watch over him too. Goodnight, Government.  Oh my God. Oh my God they say me. They saw me and they're gonna be so angry! Maybe they didn't see me. No! No, they saw me, they see everything! I did something really bad. Really really bad.  Oh God, uh... but my parents always told me, "If you do somethin' horrible, then you have to admit it to your protector, so that you can have forgiveness." Are these people nice? Oh Jeez.  And I, I was at Barnes & Noble with my mom, and while she was looking for a book I, I saw this picture of Jennifer Lawrence in a magazine. Um it and I, well, I cut the picture out of the magazine while no one was lookin'. Dirty whore! I took the picture home with me and I, and-I, I cut Jennifer Lawrence's mouth out with scissors and then I... well I put my wiener through the hole. I have no idea why!! How can I atone for it?! I already said the Pledge of Allegiance 50 times! And I sang "My Country Tis Of Thee" 100 times! And I watches "America's Got Talent" twice! What else can I do? Sure, I love the Truth. Wull what's a Jehovah's Witness. Oh my goodness! Your little cartoon has a girl on fire! Oh, you shouldn't be handing out drawings like that, ma'am. Uh, don't you know that the government is watching you? Can I ask you something? When was the last time you went to your local DMV? Oh, you can walk there. Trust me, you've gotta go to the DMV. It's incredible! See, I was like you once. Afraid, unsure, and doin' stuff I shouldn't do like showin' people pictures of little girls with their heads on fire. But you know what I've learned? That just goin' to the DMV, and letting go of all my wrongdoings, filled me with a joy I've felt nowhere else! Would you like to read some DMV literature?  Hello, Craig. How would you like to know the Truth? We're just goin' through the neighborhood an' seein' if you've accepted the government into your heart. You see, Craig, once I came clean with the government, I no longer had anything to hide. Then I found peace. Have you read any DMV literature? Well, there's a lot of interesting stuff in here, Craig. There's even some quotes from President Obama.  Could you read this part out lout? Yeah. Whattaya think President Obama means when he says that? Well, ''we'' believe that he means the government loves you, and it wants to forgive you if you just let the government into your heart. Uh huh.  Uh, I don't think I really followed all that. Congratulations, Brother! How do you feel?  I pledge allegiance. Hello. How would you like to know the Truth? It's time to let go, Eric. Don't you see there's no other way? Just let the government into your heart.  Your government doesn't listen in on you to punish you, your government just wants you to be honest about your mistakes. Yes. Yes! That's right. We've got a new member today! Eric Cartman, do you love your country?! Do you pledge allegiance to the Flag?! Hallelujah! 
Murder porn? I called the networks that are putting this smut out there, and you know what they told me?! They told me if I didn't want my parents watchin', then I should spend more time with them! Like it's ''my'' fault!  I was out by the lake last night and I saw my dad out in this field. He was harvesting sugarcane. It didn't make any sense because he was trying to harvest the sugarcane with a hammer. I saw him take my mom up to the top of this big... thing he had built, and he yelled "Hey, watch out for the Creepers!" but she ''fell''! Yeah. And then my dad just went berserk and came over and picked me up and threw me down a well!  I was trapped down there all night! I finally found a ladder and I was able to hoist myself out and there was my dad... frozen in the lake! It was like he had no idea how to swim out of it! Oh God it was so terrible! It was so terrible! Huh? 
Yes. Oh boy! Zombie apocalypse! Holy Moly. Well, at least I'll bet Tolkien's glad it's over with. Aren't you, Tolkien?  
Heheh, yeah.  
Whoa, look at it! Boy Eric, I sure do admire your courage to admit when you made a mistake. Let's go get the kindergartners. Uh they're gonna wanna see this too!  Hohoh! What'd you do, Kyle? Busted! Just stop, please. 
Woo, spooky.   Uh, sorry, I haven't watched it yet. Well Wizard Cartman, I started watching Game of Thrones. Well it's it's pretty good, I guess, but have you ever noticed that almost every time they show a guy's wiener, that guy's character is gay? Well ih-it's just that they have a lot of girls' boobs and vagina's and stuff, but most times they show a man's wiener, it's because that guy's in a love scene with another guy. Do you think it's because gay wieners are less threatening to women viewers? Yeah, I know. Winter is comin' and there's dragons and zombies on the way. I'm pretty excited for that. Just could do with a little less gay wiener is all. Oh don't even get me started! I keep watchin' that show and I'm waitin' for the darn dragon to show up and, and kick everyone's butt! But all I get is wiener, wiener, wiener. It's not all gay wiener, but when they DO show a straight guy's wiener, it's all soft and floppy. Even though he just got done humpin' a pretty girl! Why is that? Because a soft wiener isn't threatening, just like a gay wiener.  ''I'm'' obsessed with wieners? Well what about HBO? 
 Yeah! You mean Princess Kenny, m'lord? They don't! Yeah, I finished it! Nothing! The dragons are just still on their way! They keep promising dragons, but all I get are more floppy wieners in my face! Wha-what do you want ''me'' to do? Who's George R. R. Martin? Well come on, Scott. You're lagging. Let's just talk to this guy, and then we can hit a McDonald's. Oh here we go. 2217.  Hello? Is this George R. R. Martin's house? Uhhhh, it's two kids who want to know what happens when the dragons show up?  Hello? We're not fans! We don't like it! And I'm pretty pissed off, if you wanna know the truth! Let me talk to George R. R. Martin, and I'll tell him about what!  Uh no sir, we just really need to know about the dragons, but they never seem to show up. When?  Please. It's urgent. No, uhno, can we skip the wiener stuff and just get to the dragons? Uh what's the matter, Scott? He's diabetic. Oh. Okay, thanks. OOAH! Uh, sir, you said pizzas were coming! But you said they were on their way like three hours ago!   Listen, buddy! You promised that pizzas were on the way! If they don't show up right now, you're gonna have a dead kid in your hands! Do you hear me?! What kind do we want?! Come on, Scott! We're leaving!  NO! Black Friday is about to happen, and my friends and I have to be the first ones inside the mall to get XBoxes! Whatoyou mean? 
Now just hold on a minute! Well I'm pretty darned sure the fastest way back to Colorado isn't on horseback! What's that?  Hey, fellas. What did I miss?  The graphics are definitely like 10% better than the old XBox.  Yeah, and if you believe that I've got a big floppy wiener to dangle in your face! 
So then, ah, the fella with the mustache eats all the cupcakes, and the lady takes out a gun and puts it in his face and she says "I"-  Oh. Yes? Oh. Oh like a date? Oh no thanks, Lisa. I really appreciate the offer, but you're too fat for me. See ya, Lisa!  Oh. Hey, Wendy. Am I just an asshole? Well, m-no. I've got arms and legs; I've got everything. Ah, I think she's a nice girl too. She's just too big for me. Well Kim Kardashian is skinny and she just had a baby! I'm sorry, Wendy, but I have a different standard when it comes to my women.  I want a woman who takes care of herself and knows how to look good, who's got perfect skin and no splotches on her legs, and perfect everything. You're a liar! You did! You said Kim was short, fat, and hairy with big feet and she's a hobbit! Oh, she said it again! Oh no, you don't, Wendy! You're not trappin' me inside the computer lab to beat me up! Well, alright, but if you try to punch me, I'll scream!  Okay. That's Lisa Berger? She's pretty! Hold on. Are you saying that girl wants to go out with me? And I said no? Oh man, I gotta upload this  Lisa? Lisa Berger? Anybody seen Lisa Berger?  Oh hey, Eric. Have you seen Lisa Berger anywhere? II know! I'm gonna tell her I love her, and we're gonna be together and be happy forever. What?! Well since when? No way! Go back to Annie Nelson! She's built like a Slim Jim!  I do love water balloons.  
 Rotten boobie turds! Man this sucks! Yeah, we're sick of school! But all the good attention-getting startup names are taken.  We already got a dollar! One dollar pledge! Another two dollars!  Washington Redskins. Go fuck yourself.  Oh no! Hang on, is this the company where I don't get raped? Yeah, he-here, right? Okay, I'm uh stayin' here. Happy Deadline Day! Oh boy, this is like Christmas morning! It's not coming up on my phone either. I... Holy Mother Mary! Somebody raided Kickstarter and they burned the building to the ground! Somebody killed Kickstarter! Yeah, we can do it, fellas! It'll be like old times! We finally did it! 
 Hey Eric! I'm not suspended no more.  I think someone's in there. That's Cartman's new transgender bathroom. He's not a woman, he's not a man, he is something that you'll never understand. But he would die for me.  Holy moly! [Wendy pulls out a key and goes into the Other bathroom]  Hey! Everything okay, Stan? Just hold it. That's what I do now.  Yeah, what's the big idea harassing Erica, Stan?! Yeah! Stan's a big old fat cissy! Hey! Where do you think you're going?! Oh no you don't! You've gotta use the cissy bathroom!  
''Loo looloo loo loo loo loo, Loo looloo loo loo.'' Hey, Eric, I'm just lookin' at a video of bird eggs that I took. I don't know, this bird nest is pretty neato. My dad and I shot it yesterday at the lake. You can see the momma bird fly in. We took all kinds of video with his drone.  You know, those drone thingies. You can make it fly anywhere, and shoot video, and stuff. It can fly like a quarter mile away from whoever's controlling it. And it can take video the entire time right to your phone. Don't touch the propellers. Are you crazy?! This is my ''dad's'' drone! My dad said it's not for spying on people. Oh, he'll know. You can hear it take off.  No, Eric. I don't wanna d- Comin', Dad!  Yes, it's me. Of course not! What?! You said nobody would know! Be careful! The powerlines! Okay, uh, maybe that's enough.   Let me see! Jeeeeezz! What do I do?!  I don't know what to do!  Oh, heh-hey, Dad.  Ah, hold on Dad. I should be sleepin'. Why do you ask? I love you too, Dad.  What the heck are you doing?! When did you put Craig's mom's bush on the Internet?! You promised me we wouldn't get in trouble! Now everyone is gonna know what we were doing! WHY?! I should have never listened to you! Ah I should have known this would get out of hand! Are you out of your mind?! What are you doing?! Why would you turn "Craig's mom's bush" into a music video starring us?! Why can't you leave it alone?! Why can't you just stop?! Why?! That poor lady. Her vagina is everywhere. Poor Craig. Do you remember when I showed you the video of the little bird eggs? Well that's the last time I felt happy. I have to tell the truth. I want you and Kenny to come with me and tell Craig's mom we're sorry and that we'll- I don't want anymore discussions, Eric! I don't want anymore excuses! I just want to end this so we can take our punishment and be done with it! I don't want all these drones everywhere! Nobody does! You do? What? NO! There is NO WAY I'm gonna- ...Okay. If this doesn't work, we're dead. Craig's mom doesn't seem very happy. No! No, no! I'm sorry. Thank you, Eric! I screwed up everything, but now everyone's happy! Thanks for covering my ass! 
Congratulations, Kyle. Well, it's just 49 cents for the cheapest one.  We're playing the Terrance & Phillip Freemium Game. 
WHOOAA! It's all so real! Uh this is amazing! It's like I'm there!  Wow, you were right. I can actually feel it. I feel Stan! He looks totally real! More of the school.  The school and all the kids.  I still can't hear any sound except for your voice.  What what what?  Oh yeah, that it would split my neurons and scramble my brains! I forgot! I'm sorry! Yeah.  Okay, I'm back in your room!  Wow! That was cool! I touched Wendy's boob.  Hey Eric! What'd ya say to the principal for missing first period?  You know what I said? She asked me why I wasn't in school and I said "Well, technically I was in school." Tee hee. Sorry guys, but Eric and I know a little something you don't. Not that it's anything that cool. Right Eric? Yeah.  Well, not a hundred percent... Okay, subject is ready. Interim status is go. It worked! I'm back in. All systems normal. Going now!  Okay. How much more of this am I supposed to clear up? Okay. It's so realistic.  Alright, I think that's all of it.  There's an old fat lady here! She's holding out money for me! Okay, I got it! Already? Oh no! I'm sorry, Eric, but there's just one thing I gotta do real quick.  Hello, Dad! It's me, Butters! This is for all the times I got grounded!  HA! I can almost feel his balls on my fist!  Haha! How do you like that, Dad?! Huh, that was incredible! I feel amazing!   Who's the man now?! I'm gonna take his car! This is like ''Grand Theft Auto''! Whoa! I'm in the car now. Hahaha, I'm in the bad part of town! I just hit a lamp post! Ah, ah-I'm back on my feet. Oh, oh that's cool. There's a prostitute out here. I'm gonna beat her up and take her money! Take that, you dumb hooker! I'm taking your money! Ow. Oh she stabbed me. Uh the hooker stabbed me. I can't  I can't breathe too good. Eric, I can't see. Are you still there? Oh... I think I overdid it. I have to take this thing off. What the hell? What the hell is that?! AAAH! I... I d-didn't think a knife could really hurt me. Ah I thought I was just in a virtual reality. Aw nuts! I wonder how long I'm grounded for? Ahhh! Eric! Uh what are you doing here? What?  Nuh uh! WHAT??   Aghah. Okay, stop! Stooop! Ah how do you know that?! Aaaaah! Yes! Y-yes everything's fine! NO!  Please! You can't do that! I have to find a way out of this! ...What? What do you mean? I don't know what you mean. Eric, you said you were going to get me out of this virtual world! Oh really? Oh, that's a relief. Oh gosh! OH GOSH! Yeah. Kyle, it's Butters. I've been grounded! No no, you don't understand. This time I've been grounded for no good reason! I didn't do anything, Kyle! I think there's somethin' supernatural goin' on. I asked my dad why I was being grounded, and he said that for asking him, that I was more grounded! It doesn't make sense! PLEASE! Just go to Cartman's house. I think the answer might be within the- Ahhh! Wuhhhh! Ahhh-    you guys can't be here. Because I'm grounded. That means no visitors. When we were playing with the Oculus headset. Wuh don't you guys remember?  We were all messin' around with it. I played with it first, and, and went a little nuts. Uh I forgot I was in virtual reality and I got grounded, and now I'm grounded in real life. YES.  AAaaghagh! Huh I'm sorry Dad!  Ahhh, huh? You... you, you mean ih...  I'm not grounded? They did it!  Whoopie!  Fellas, I'm not grounded anymore. 
Oh no! Kenny! But he's dying!  Dangit, I wish I knew people.  Yeah. Wow, the cops came? 
What's a PewDiePie do? Well it's a really great game. The characters are so rich. It's true! Heheyehah. 
Hmmm, it's kind of gay. I mean, havin' it all rhyme 'n stuff, you know? Well, gay is wholesome. 
No, he got brainwashed by a cult. What??  Did you guys hear? Cartman got four days' detention, for calling Heidi Turner "clitty litter"! But the thing is, Eric isn't even fightin' it. It's like he's all sad and scared. Yeah, what? Well what would Tom Brady say if he got caught shoplifting. Yeah! Well ohhh-kay!  What do we do now?  Oh no! I'm here, Eric. Yes Eric. Well they're fine. Everyone's just kind of keepin' their mouths shut. It's kinda nice.  So the PC guys are leavin' people alone. Well, except for... Well, well now they've made Kyle their main target. Eric, what are you doing? Oh, but I thought you agreed with them. Well ohhh-kay! 
Well they're all eatin' together and praying. A-and they're puttin' syrup on their Mac & Cheese!  Uhn-un. Yeah, sorry. I can't listen to another one either.  What made Mr. Garrison do that? You really think Kyle would do that? Lion King II? No, no. Not it! Oh. OH SHIT! She's not hot! She looks like a messed-up cucumber with wieners on it! Alanis Morissette is like 80 years old or something!  Jeez! Well I don't want a Canadian girlfriend, Eric! No! The one in the white shoes isn't that ugly. Okay!  Hi, my name's Butters, what's yours. Oh Charlotte, I've never done this before. You think Scar's up there? He wasn't my father, but he's still part of me. Oh no, Simba, we have barely begun. We'll run away together and ... and...? Here you go. What's "sore-y"? Oh. Heh, he-hey, heh that's neato.  What do you want?! No, we saw a movie and now we're goin' to the park. If I'm gonna be with this girl, I don't want her someday thinking it was all super-rushed! Yeah, just some work-related stuff.  Oh boy, yes I'd love to, here we go, oh God. Well uh, well yes, sir. W-wait, you don't wanna be here? Wuh well, you know, 'cause everything is great here, and we have cool stuff. But- so- then, why did you leave? Jeez, how bad can a president be? You don't got to be sore-y. It's me who should be sore-y. I think everyone has the wrong idea about your people, Charlotte. I wasn't supposed to have time. I was supposed to give you a Hot Cosby, so our species could coexist. But now I realize you guys don't even wanna be here. There's really nowhere I'd rather be.  If it's okay with you, well I'd like to try a nice Slow Cosby instead. So do we. Charlotte! Ah, I should have done the Hot Cosby. 
Well do you think it's true? Do you think we're really bigoted country bumpkins? 
Did you get 'em? Did you get 'em? Did you get 'em? Huh? Whoooaaa.  How do you do it, Eric? Jeeeeezzz.  Well aren't you eatin' lunch, Eric? Wow! Well you're pretty important, Eric.  Oh, hey Eric. Oh I'm sorry, bud. Well Eric, you should be proud that people wanna be like you. Ha ah, I mean, you really started something. Well if these people look up to you, maybe, maybe you can sort of, set the record straight and show them the way it's supposed to be done. 
Do I gotta? Well, if I get detention, uh, I'll get grounded.  Eric, hold up. Yeah. Yeah, right here.  I just finished this morning. Yeah. And the people commenting on your Yelp page starts here.  It's a pretty brutal job sifting through all that darkness. But, PC Principal, I really don't have time. Yes sir... Yech. Oh God that's terrible. Jesus. Whoa my God. Wugh.  Yeah! Well, I'm sorry, Eric. I, I guess it slipped through the cracks. I'm overloaded with all the new people. Well, I've got Demi Lovato  to take care of now, and Lena Dunham just put a picture of her asshole on Twitter, and wants only the positive comments. Okay, Eric.   Do I have to, sir? PC Principal, ah, I don't think you quite realize how much negative stuff I have to sift through. Vin Diesel too??  Uh, delete! "You aren't fat, but my dick is-" Whoa, God. GAAAHHH! What?  I don't know you, sir!  The man! The man the man the man the man!  Do you see the man?! Well, he's gonna get me!  The world is darkness! The man is coming! Aaaaa! Aaaaa!  The man is gonna get me if I don't stop!  Are you sure this is a good idea? 
Well, but then why would Asian girls draw them like that? Yeah! 
Over this way!  Hey Eric, you wanna try sparring with me? OOF. Ow. Ahem. We're just cool 'cause we're tough, and we fight and stuff, and we can ah-. Yeah? Uh I thought you said it first. Whoa, cool! Why, this is the greatest thing ever you guys! 
 
 Fellas! We found out what happened to Jimmy! He got to go on a vacation for being an exemplary student. What about Jimmy's? What are you doing now? Wow that looks fun!  Wow, what kind of ice cream is that? So Clyde said to Tolkien, "Why don't you open a bank account with your mouth so I can deposit my dick in it?"  Well Tolkien was all like- We got distracted. We've gotta get back to that computer!  We're tryin' on shoes and eatin' chicken nuggets, stupid. What do you think? Yeah. Nothin'. Wuh huh, that's a good point. 
 Yeah, everybody's pretty freaked out over here, baby. Everyone is on edge and feelin' really nervous. I will, honey. Heh,  Kyle's got a girlfriend? Guns? I already feel a lot safer.  Yeah. 
Haha! You guys see what Skankhunt42 did on the school server now? Hehe, he photo shopped a picture of Heidi Turner's mom with a dick in her mouth!  Eric! What happened! 
They're talking about how they're gonna get us - what do you think? That's how the world works now. You get blamed for the group you belong to, even if you didn't do nothing! What are we gonna do about them? He's not gonna stop, he's loving all this! He wants the girls to hurt us! It's him, or us! 
 It's not the police we have to worry about, it's Eric. He's gonna get us. It doesn't matter. He's comin'. He's comin' to get us.  Eeeaaaahhhh! 
It's been a rough few weeks, Baby. The girls are still mad about being trolled on the school message board, parents are all freaking out about the election and, and I tell you... you are glad to not be living in this country right now.  But Baby, I love you! I need you! You can't break up with me! Oh my god, I can't believe they got to you.  Those sneaky snakes in the grass! Well you know who, the girls in my school! They all broke up with their boyfriends and now they got you to go along with them! So then it's true! You're all snakes in the grass! Every  last one of you! Oh Charlotte?  Honey? Well why don't you just shut the fuck up, Kyle? this is our fault, how boys need to change. Well I'm getting pretty sick of it. Everyone else seems to be proud about who they are, but not us; and then we get Uncle Kyle here telling us that the girls are right!  wieners! No!  We tried doing it your way, Kyle. We tried doing what the girls wanted us to do and where did it get us?  Right! It turned us against one of our own match, that's what it did! What happened to Eric Cartman is the girl's fault, not ours! I'm done feeling guilt. I'm a boy, dang nab it! And you know what? I'm proud of my little wiener. Mark my words, the moment is coming when you all need to decide; are you with your kind,  or are you with Uncle Kyle.   We walk together in peace! We walk together in peace! We're not poor for feeling ashamed in who we are! We're not gonna feel guilt for the way we were born! Wieners out! Don't let anyone tell you you are somehow nice because you're a boy! Don't let anyone tell you to not think with your wiener, as if your wiener is a bad thing! What makes us different makes us beautiful! No more shame, no more doubt, no more bigotry! Don't be an Uncle Kyle! Be proud of who you are! You are either with us or against us! It's really that simple! Good for you, Uncle Kyle! 
 Anytime anywhere, skank. Why? You're afraid to fight me like a man?  The bouncy ball?  That's it! I am through with your stupid crap! Every house I've been to just rips on me and and says Denmark is stupid! I told you fellas! This is what you get for working with a bunch of stupid girls! 
What do you want?! Well I don't know, Eric. NO! I'm not doing anything for you! You're a traitor! Yeah! Boys and girls were at war, but you go and kiss your little girlfriend's ass! Whatever happened to sticking with your kind?! Because girls drove us to break all your stuff, dumbass! If anyone should be pissed at chicks, it should be you! But no, you got your bitchy little girlfriend pullin' your strings now! Oh God, listen to you!  Traitor!  How dare you be ashamed of who you are?!   What? Well, I'm just angry, Mr. Gentleman. I'm tired of girls saying boys need to change. Somebody has to stand up for our rights!  No. The end? Of what? 
Hey, Eric!  Well I want to get the fuck off this planet, but they told me I had to take a number.  No, you don't understand. I've seen the light, I'm a changed man, I thought boys were being treated unfairly, but now I know... shit's about to get a lot worse. Loolooloo, I've got some apples. Loolooloo, you've got some too. No no, believe me. I'm a changed man. Girls are really smart, and they'll be running the country soon, and they deserve total respect. Well I don't think there was ever any question women are funny. Remember that movie ''9 to 5'' with Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton? Well I laughed my butt off and it never even occurred to me that they were women. I don't know why things changed. I don't know why people make such a big deal about women and comedy now. I mean what about Carol Burnett? She was great. Yeah, well I swear I don't care how many times Amy Schumer talks about her vagina, I laugh every time.  Hey, that's me too. Yippee! Mr. Musk, wait!  
 He-heyeah! Don't worry about Heidi, she's a hoot.   Going pee! Because you keep on telling everyone she is. Eric Eric, trust me! I want nothing to do with girlfriends!  I know what girlfriends do; they make you feel happy like you never felt, then they crawl up inside of you and poop out your heart. That's how it ends, Eric. Girls get you to feel for them, make you think they're the best thing in the world, and then they leave, move on to the next thing; and you're left there crying, with your heart covered in poop. Sure buddy, sure. Don't feel bad about getting duped, Eric. Its happened to all of us. The truth is girls hate us, Eric. They're sick of our shit. And one day, they plan to make us obsolete, stick us underground where we just get milked for our semen. Boys' only hope is to start over on Mars. 
Yep. Are you sure about what's going to happen on Mars. Because Eric knows the future. I used to think women were funny, too, but Eric talked me out of it. Gee, I don't know what to tell you, buddy. What?! Oh, I'm at SpaceX. Where are you? Well, we sort of created this ginormic energy source, but now, we're trying to figure out what to do with it. Like enough to get humanity to Mars. 
Okay,  Alexa, add "smelly tampon boogers" to my shopping list. What was? How do you change someone who's mentally abusive? 
I thought you said you broke up with Heidi. So then why did you take her back? Hey Craig, how come Tweek's not at school? 
  You can't take away a day off! We're just innocent children! It ain't right. They make you work like a dog and then they just tear away your one day off in October like you're a piece of trash! I love that movie. Dang it! There's nothing? It's over, Eric. We have to come to school on Monday. Just face it. 
No Dad, I'm not looking at boobies.  Waahahahahaha! Oh, hey fellas. Uuuuuuummm, nope.   Yes, fellas? You mean like Suicide Squad?  Look fellas, you have a right to be on Facebook and I have a right to be on facebook. And sometimes that's going to cause a little...  Gotta get to classss.  Who are you?! What do you want?! Oh. Are you Adam? Well, come on in.  Attention employees. Kelly Shmidt has just written her 100th fake blog post that was shared over a thousand times on Facebook. Let's hear it for Kelly!  Calm down, everyone. Stick to your work. I will deal with these trespassers. It's the 21st century, gentlemen! There's nothing illegal about what I'm doing. Actually, that ''IS'' illegal. And besides, you can't do anything to me.  It's the Facebook Safeguard program. Just $17 monthly gets you personal protection from Mark Zuckerberg. What's goin' on? Hey everyone, keep working! What are you talking about?  Curse you, Coon and Friends! This isn't over! Uh oh. Wah. No sir, I, ah. No sir, I just ah. Well I was just, uh, well, I just said how I just used Facebook like Russia did. And I really didn't break any rules. 
 Drug dealer?? Haw Jeez.  Get out of the way, dude! <poem><i>Insane in the brain</i></poem> Hey, where are ya'll goin'? 
 Hey, where you been, Eric? Our parents are never gonna let us trick or treat with a flying witch around!  Yeah, I got there really early too. You get the best pumpkins that way. Anyways, I guess the witch destroyed the whole thing.  Yeah, but what are we gonna do? Yeah, we've got to save Halloween. Don't you think so, Eric? We've got to do something to get rid of her! I knew Eric would come up with a plan!  Yeah, and it turns out our dads and the bad witch were all part of the same witch group. Oh, uh, eh hello Mr. President. How are you? How uh, how is runnin' the country going? Did you get rid of all the immigrants like you said? Cool. Ah-and did you build that big wall you were gonna build? N-no, sir! I uh, well, the thing is, uh, didn't you used to do J and C Witch Week with our dads? Well, the thing is, Mr. President, one of the guys did a spell and took a bunch of children, and he's gonna eat 'em all. Mr. President, please, you've gotta help. Our dads can't do anything 'cause they're scared people are comin' after all wtiches. Okay! Where? Holy moly!  
Well, it's not our problem. Maybe she's telling the truth, Kyle. Maybe Eric really does love and support her in ways that we don't see.  Hey, Kyle. Hey, I was thinkin' about what you said. How we should all help Heidi break up with Eric? You're right, it's our moral obligation. Oh, we're not? Fuck him up, Eric! 
Whoa.  Uh hey. Uhh, I can't. I'm going to a birthday party. 
Fight's over. Kyle ruined it.  
Well, should we order now? 
 Add together the three and the three. Waaah!  Hey Eric. Oh, Jeez, want me to help you study? Oho, Black Panther? Well that was a great movie!  Well, what do you want me to do? I got hall monitor duty. Okay, Eric.  Wull it's the entire glee club this time! Oh crap! The math quiz? It's already fourth period? Well okay!  Waaaagh! Waaaaaagh! 
Father, can I talk to you? Well, what's troubling you?  You know, at school the kids used to all make fun of me sometimes. One kid would say something mean, a-and then the other kids would laugh. I know how lousy it feels. I learned to just walk away, not give 'em all the satisfaction. I know it seems impossible. I thought I'd be a punching bag my whole life, but now, I'm one of the popular kids. I even get invited to board game night at Stan's house. My point is, sometimes, y-you just gotta put yourself out there.  So, Kyle, did you know Father is a really good singer? You like to sing too, don't you? Aw, Father, wait a- Father!  Come on, Father, you can't give up so fast. Who cares? Who cares what people say? Aw, come on, you gotta be strong! Because I was you. Okay? I wasn't always this cool. I've been through it. But then one day, somebody told me something. He said "life is full of love and light and bountiful things," and you know who told me that? You did! Two years ago, in church! You have a right to go and be happy! And if people wanna keep tryin' to knock you down, well, fuck 'em! There's no church today! You all are just gonna have to find some'n' better to do!  Isn't this great, Father? Fresh mountain air, a nice warm fire, a nice warm fire. Yeah, the Lord is pretty cool. Happy birthday, Clyde!  Hope you don't mind I brought a friend. That's it! You're doing great! Nobody's staring. I'm gonna get us some soda pop. You just mingle with the other fellas! Wow! Sure, Kyle. Be right back, Father.  Huh-what's up? What are you saying, Kyle? Well, of course, you don't. Well I'm sorry for tryin' to help out somebody who didn't have anywhere else to turn. We'll both just leave. I thought you were better than that, Kyle.  Father! Father? Has anybody seen my priest? Father, where'd you go?  There you are! I've been looking everywhere. But you're missin' the party!  But, they just don't understand you like I do. But it's not your fault. Why?! But... I thought we were pals. Sometimes I wonder. ...No thanks. No.  Stan? Father. What?? No! No. He can't. Father, you did it! Does that mean you're gonna stay? 
Oh, hey fellas! What are you guys doing? Well, sure! Whatcha lookin' for?  I've got strawberry, vanilla, tropical passion... Tropical passion. It's like mango and kiwi. Yeah, and at five bucks a pop, we're gonna be rich! Oof.   Why'd you punch me, Eric?! I thought we were partners! You punched me in the face! Well what's that supposed to mean?! Well, I don't know how this means you can go and punch me in the face- Hi, Kyle! You know they took away their nap time. Yeah, I wish I had a little pick-me-up! Somethin' fresh and fruity to go with my lunch!   'Cause Eric told them! Please, Kyle! We still gotta pay people off! Run! Wow! You're so smart to think of a siphon, Kyle! Does this mean we're out of the vaping business, fellas? 
We're gonna get a butt-load of candy! 
Oh, boy! This is looking so great.  Hey, Dad! The big bike parade is this weekend. How's it look? First prize is $50!  How my decorations are coming. The big bike parade is this weekend. Well, you won't think it's dumb when I win first prize. I'm goin' all out this year. I'll finally beat Larry Zewiski.  Dad!  Mom, eh if I win the first prize in the bike parade, I'll give the money to you guys. 
 Look Dad, a whole new bicycle! I'll win the bike parade for sure!  Yeah, I guess I'm lookin' forward to it.  I guess my bike could be in the bike parade. I... I hadn't really thought about it. Oh yeah.    Hey Dad? I don't need anything more. I mean, if I don't win that bike parade, I don't care. I have you guys, and... that's more important than a bike parade will ever be. No I don't Dad. Hey, Mom. Hi Dad. 
<poem><i>Get me off this farm!</i></poem> Who are you? Wow wee! Yeah. As a matter of fact, two and a half, three weeks ago, I'd say. Yeah, and then Stan came to me, and then I said "Well I can play the drums." Well, so yeah, I, okay, I'll play guitar. Well, I always liked Winnie the Pooh. Yeah. And, we're gonna be rich. Oh, that's okay, Jimmy. Yeah! And what's wrong with homosexuality anyway?! So there's not gonna be a biopic movie for us? Stinks to say goodbye to all that biopic money and glory. Yeah! Whatever it is, I got it too! 
So then I guess the school said Eric can't come here no more, and so he's been, like, kicked out. Yeah, and he was actually kind of upset about it, because he said on the phone that he has to do homeschooling with this really mean teacher. 
Yeah, it's the best. But, but this is Sloppy Joe day. The girls? Yeah, it's supposed to be sloppy Joe day! It's okay, Eric. I- Eric, Eric! Eric, Eric? Comin' through! Make way!  The protesters are tryin' to kill Eric again, Mr. Mackey. I looove barbecue rib day. You gotta calm down, Eric. Remember your condition, Eric. Okay. that's it, Eric. Eric! Somebody help!  ...Teacher?   Eric, I. I just hate lying to you. I mean, you've been in the hospital. Twice. I feel guilty. It's our lunches, Eric. It's... Incredible Meat. No, Eric. See, there was this guy. He's a goo man.   Oh, God, Eric! What are you gonna do?!  Oh, God. Someone's gonna die. 
 One minute, Dad! Archeologist Butters just needs to get his stamp and sticker for his autograph book.  Aha! another rare find! Well wait wait, we can't leave yet! I got all the stickers and tamps except for one! Can I just check around one last time? Well o-kay! Been there... Saw that... Where's that stupid last sticker stamp?  Whoa...  But this is my last one!  Happy Halloween, Mister! M-Mon?  Why thank you. Thank you. I... actually already have a Fitbit, but I could- I could give this one to a friend.  Yes sir? what... happened in town?  Oh, uh, a mummy, huh? That's, that's weird. What?? The mummy talked to you?? There was no argument. I just said I already had it and I'd give it to a friend. I, I just goh- No! I didn't throw the mummy out of the house! The mummy got all pissed off at me and left!  But I didn't do anything wrong! Okay, look officers, I think  I'm under some kind of curse. ...and that's all that happened. I put that stamp in the sticker book, and now this mummy is destroying everything around me. I need help. Wuh-what, what do you mean? Wait. The mummy talked to you, too? Why is it talking to everyone?! No it doesn't! This is crazy! First of all, I don't have fun at school! And secondly... the mummy can do whatever it wants; I don't care! I have to end this curse, fellas. It's getting worse every day. Last night the mummy attacked my parents, and it said I was being narcissistic. It has no reason. No logic! One minute it's destroying everything, and the next it's sending me selfies like nothing ever happened. Look!  This whole thing is so crazy it's starting to make me think I'm crazy!  It's a freaking mummy! Wouldn't you talk about it?! I would love that, but I don't have a choice! I swear, you guys. Mummies can smell fun! Whenever I'm somewhere, and I actually start havin' a good time, I get a call or a text from the mummy sayin' "Hey, what are you doin'?" Like it knows. Yeah. It is fun to get away and just talk to you guys.  What are you in for? I'm in here because *apparently* I'm a passive-aggressive controlling and manipulative psychopath whose narcissitic behavior drives other people crazy. So I said, "Okay, fine. You don't ever do anything wrong! It's all me! You've got no problems, only I have problems! Alright, uh I'll lock my own ass up! Then we'll see who's got issues!" I'll be in here, and something will go horribly wrong tonight, and then the monster will have to accept what it is, and finally work on changing, right?  The mummy! I told you! I'm...  I'm sorry? I'm so sorry. You're right. I can be selfish and narcissistic. Ah I'm gonna work on myself and... and try to make this curse work somehow.  
Oh Jeez. We should have never played football that close to the road. Wu-where are you going, Eric? 
 No sir! Okay. I jump up to the bugbear! And I yell "FOR WATERDEEP!" and I kick it in the balls! In D&D they killed the dungeon master.  Well we didn't even think it was possible to kill the dungeon master. Hey, that's not a bad idea. We've been taking it easy on the girls. Time to show 'em what real board gamers play.  Wow, Scott. I didn't know it was that bad.  Uh hey, fellas! Come quick! You gotta see! Well, it's the girls! They started their own board game club at the school!   Well this is like what you said Dice Studz would be, Eric. 
Well they just gotta get their Christmas spirits back. They just gotta. I'm sorry, Santa, I just can't think of anything I want this year. Well I guess maybe now I'm losing my Christmas Spirit. Neah. Mandalorian was great the first few episodes, but it's really fallin' apart lately.  Yeah, that's a little too much holiday spirit, if you ask me. 
Hey, Dad, do you think maybe we could go to Build-A-Bear today? But they said they were open again, so I-  That I'm never going ever again! I'm never going to Build-A-Bear, am I?!  Wha? Okay. Save me from what?  I sure am, fellas! Whoa! Is it really for reals? Oh! Good job, Stan! Thanks for getting my hopes up, you asshole! Oh boy, is this a dream? The Caballero Grizzly. Wow! Aaaah! God! Daaagh! We gotta surrender, fellas. I'm honestly not having that much fun anyway. 
 Anything fun happen at school today?! Oh, my gosh! That sounds like so much fun! Yeah! I just wanted to believe in something that would get me out of the house! I didn't give a shit what it was. 
Guess that's just part of being a kid these days.  We could shoot up the school! Wuh huh huh?! Yes? Uh, no, sir! Uh... Huh... He... 
Hey, we never hang out just you and me either, Stan! Yup! 
Well– Well, sure Eric! What's goin' on? Oh... Oh, and you're worried that maybe now your mom won't always be there to take care of you? Well, not really. Wow! Well, that sounds like a good deal!  Wow wee! Gosh, thanks, Eric!  Yeah, it's real roomy! 
Hi, Josslyn! Hi, Staci Mae! Hi, Mom! Hi, Dad! I'll do my best, Dad! That kid? Oh, Jesus! Not Melancholy!  Well, I dunno!  What is what?  Oh, geez! Put that thing away, Melancholy! Hello, sir. I just needed to talk to somebody. I've been having some problems at home. Well, it's just my parents. You see, a few months ago, I saw this little girl riding a pony and I said, "Whoa! I wanna do that!" So we found a stable and a trainer, and I started to learn dressage. And I got to lease a pony, and his name is Melancholy. Well, I love to ride Melancholy. But now I'm feeling all this pressure to win. My parents said I have to win because it's against the Russians. It's the Russians. I mean, I guess they're just really good at dressage, but now my dad says it's a matter of national security. Don't move my head? I – Well, o-okay, but I kind of am asking you for help, ya know, because I'm feeling really lost and miserable. Well, they said if I don't do well at dressage, it could mean the end of all of our freedoms. We need to have a serious talk, Melancholy, and I need you to listen.  That's it! You got it, boy! Nope! Nope! Melancholy! Over the jump, boy!  Melancholy, back to the jump! Whoa, Melancholy, Whoa!! W-What are you doing now? Now I'm not sure what's going on here.  No! No! No! Melancholy! Bad pony! I'm sorry, ma'am! Melancholy, to the jump! This is it, Melancholy. We have to do this. We have to be classy. We're not gonna poop, we're not gonna get a boner, and we're certainly not gonna have unwarranted sex with the ladies. Please, boy... we have got to get this right. It's ok, Melancholy...we did our best... Whoa! Where you goin', Melancholy? Melancholy! Bad!  Waaaghhaaagh! 
 ''Loo loo loo! It's St. Patrick's Day! Looo loo loo! De doot be do!'' Okay, mom!  Ohhh dad, are you wearin' green or are you gonna get a pinch? Okay! Well someone's gettin a pinch today! Hey, Clyde! You got your green on! Hey Jimmy! Nice green pants! Tee-hee! Te hee hee hee!  Happy St. Patrick's Day, fellas! You guys all look very festive! Oh, I hope they put green food coloring in our milk at lunchtime again like last year!  Uh-oh! Hey, Kelly-Ann! What's going on? Looks like someone forgot what day it was! Ha ha! Pi-i-i-i-nch!  I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I didn't mean to do anything wrong, honest! I'm so sorry! Please! It's just... Well, she had it comin' on account of the way she was dressed! Oh, jeez, I didn't know Kelly-Ann was a minor! Well, she didn't have a mining helmet or a pick axe or anything! But... But, sir, it's St. Patrick's Day. Yes! Right! Yes? Ugh... Okay... Oh, God...  Wul, it's just... I mean... What you're wearing. You know, it's St. Patrick's Day, you're not wearing any... You don't have any green socks on, do you? Ohhhhh God... I wanna pinch you so bad... No, ma'am, could you... Maybe put on some green lipstick or something? Well, technically, yes! I mean, St. Patrick's Day is a wonderful day where we remember a British Roman man who went to Ireland and converted the whole country to Christianity! And he used a clover to represent the Holy Trinity, so we're supposed to celebrate that by wearing green and if you don't wear green you get a pinch! See?! That's the problem! Nobody knows how great he really was. Oh, God... I didn't finger nothin! I swear it was just a tiny little St. Patrick's Day pinch! It was... It was like this!  Oh! Ohhgu!  Dear St. Patrick... If you're really up there... I've always done my best to honor you on this most holy day... You went to Ireland, and you got all those pagan worshippers to follow Christ. If there's any way... that you could help me now... just, like, send me a leprechaun or something... I will be forever your dark servant. Amen. Whoa...  Wow wee, are you a real leprechaun? Alright! Are we gonna bust outta here or what?  Pi-i-i-i-nch!  Whu... Oh, hey, fellas. Pretty good. What are you gonna do? I knew St. Patrick would perform a miracle to get us out of here! Just like when he was a slave, he will help us go free! It is not over! What did St. Patrick say when he was taken from his homeland and turned into a slave?! St. Patrick didn't give up! And when the Christians slandered him while he was trying to convert the heathen Irish, did he give up then?!  Yeah! You see?! The power of St. Patrick compels you!  Yes, now use your clover rays!  Uh oh!  Wahggh!  Ahghggh!  It's him! It's St. Patrick! Once again... I shoulda never listened to what they told me in church.
