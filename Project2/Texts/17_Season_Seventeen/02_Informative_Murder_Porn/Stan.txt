You guys are watchin' murder porn? Okaaay.  What's up dude? Uh, yeah, the first grader? What?! What happened?  What? You guys don't need to be watching that stuff.  That's impossible. Are you guys sure you set it up right? What? Butters, what happened? In Minecraft. Whattaya mean? It's true, dude. Maybe we just need to trust that our parents won't act out what they see.  Look dude, we're trying to keep our parents away from graphic television shows! This could be a matter of life and death! What, dude? So? Aha!  You have no idea what this is about, do you?! We were using Minecraft to block our parents from watching spousal homicide shows! No no,  just ''ID Network, A&E, Oxygen,'' and ''Oprah's network.'' All the ones with murder porn. Look, can you unpackage them so we only get the channels we want? We want specific networks dropped from our cable. No, that's way too long! Goddammit, I just don't want my parents to murder each other!  Can't you see that all we're trying to do is keep our families safe? Look, ah I don't know if seeing couples murder each other on television is gonna make my parents do it, and we probably won't be able to stop them from watching what they wanna watch. All we're trying to do is make it a little more difficult for them. Because cable makes is so convenient. Sure, if they didn't have easy access to their murder porn channels, they'd be bummed out, but it's not just our responsibility to give them what they want. Is it? What? I said it's not our responsibility to give them what they want. I... said it would really bum them out. Well then maybe you should go live with Jaden Smith, Dad.
