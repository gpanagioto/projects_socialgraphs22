-----


Bus Stop. The boys await the bus. Mir crashes. One end of it falls on top of Kenny, narrowly missing the other boys.

Stan

Oh my God! They killed Kenny!

Kyle

You bastards!

Cartman

What the hell is that thing?

Kyle

It looks like a UFO.

Cartman

There's no such thing as UFOs.

-----


Sirens wail as ambulance pulls up. Two paramedics go over to Kenny's corpse.

Paramedic

Let's get 'im to the morgue.

-----


They put his corpse in a body bag, then toss the bag into the ambulence and drive off.

Cartman

Hey, wait til you see my Halloween costume tomorrow. It kicks ass.

Kyle

Dude, it can't be cooler than mine.

Stan

Hey man, we gotta get home and get our costumes ready.

-----


They walk off.

-----


South Park Morgue. Outside, an owl hoots, then a crow reaches the morgue's sign and shits on it. Inside the morgue a mortician places a hose into Kenny, blood starts flowing out.

Mortician

You know, I think death is least funny when it happens to a child.

-----


The other one places a hose into Kenny, green embalming fluid flows in.

Mortician Aide

Oh, yeah... I know what you mean.

-----


The aide pulls out a hot dog, pours Worcestershire sauce on it, and takes a bite.

Mortician

Marty, do you have to put that stuff on everything?

Marty

I don't know, it ju- it just makes everything taste so...English.

Mortician

Well, let's let him drain.

-----


They walk away. Worcestershire sauce falls over and pours into embalming fluid. Kenny's eyes open, and he gets up.

Mortician

...So then the necrophiliac says, "If this ain't a cadaver then I-"

-----


Kenny busts through a door and takes a bite out of the mortician's head.

Mortician

Hey!

-----


Kenny bites Marty's shoulder.

Marty

Aaah!

-----


Kenny walks away.

Marty

God damn! That little turd bit me!

Mortician

Me too!

-----


Kenny leaves the morgue and an owl hoots.

-----


Bus Stop. Kyle is standing there with a Chewbacca mask on. Stan walks up; his costume consists of red yarn hair and big rosy cheeks.

Kyle

Ha ha, you look like a pansy.

Stan

Shut up Kyle!

Kyle

What uh, what are you supposed to be?

Stan

I'm Raggedy Andy.

Kyle

Hehe. Why the hell did you dress up like Raggedy Andy dude?

Stan

Wendy's going as Raggedy Ann, and she said this way we'd win the costume contest for sure.

Kyle

No way dude. I'm gonna win the costume contest with this sweet Chewbacca costume.

Stan

Wendy said that first prize is two tons of candy.

Kyle

Wow! Cool!

-----


Cartman walks up.

Cartman

Hey, dudes.

Kyle

Cartman! What kind of costume is that?

Cartman

It's Adolf Hitler costume. Sieg Heil, sieg heil.

Stan

Where'd you get that?

Cartman

My mom made it, isn't it cool?

Kyle

No it's not cool!

Cartman

What are you supposed to be Stan, Howdy Doody?

Stan

No, I'm Raggedy Andy, fat-ass!

Cartman

Ohh, heh- wow, you look pretty cool.

-----


He and Kyle laugh.

Kyle

Hehe. Sissy.

Stan

I'll kick your ass, Kyle!

Cartman

Oh look out, Holly Hobby's all pissed off!

-----


Kenny's corpse approaches.

Stan

Hey look, Kenny's not dead.

Kyle

You forgot to wear a costume Kenny.

Stan

Yeah, what's the matter? Couldn't your family afford a costume for you?

Kyle

Yeah, why's your family so poor Kenny?

Cartman

Kenny's family is so poor that, yesterday, they had to put their cardboard box up for a second mortgage.

-----


Stan laughs. Kenny does nothing while birds chirp.

Cartman

I said, your family had to put a cardboard box up for a second mortgage, Kenny!

-----


Silence.

Cartman

I'm talking to you Kenny, achtung!

-----


Silence.

Cartman

Poor piece of crap.

-----


Ms. Crabtree's bus pulls up.

Ms. Crabtree

COME ON, WE'RE RUNNING LATE!

Stan

Aah, we're always running late you ugly stank.

Ms. Crabtree

WHAT DID YOU SAY?!

Stan

I said, "I can't wait to own a fishing tank."

Ms. Crabtree

Oh, neither can I.

-----


South Park Clinic. Marty and the mortician are being treated.

Doctor

[á la James Stewart] Very interesting.

Mortician

What, what is it doc?

Doctor

Well, your- your temperature is only 55 degrees, you have no pulse, no heartbeat, and your, your eyes are all puffy and sticky.

Mortician

Oh no, you mean...

Doctor

Yeah, I'm afraid the two of you have - Pink Eye.

-----


Marty and the mortician gasp.

Doctor

I'd give you topical medicine, but I don't wanna touch ya.

Marty

Oh I'm so hungry, and all I can think about eating is, eh, brains!

Doctor

Yeah, well for God sake don't touch your eyes. I'll prescribe some antibiotics.

-----


South Park Elementary. The boys are walking into class.

Kyle

Just wait till everyone sees my sweet Chewbacca costume. They're gonna be so jealous...

-----


The entire class has a Chewbacca mask on.

Stan

Whoa, dude!

Kyle

Everyone came as Chewbacca?!

-----


Mr. Garrison is in drag, Mr. Hat has a Chewbacca mask on.

Mr. Garrison

It sure does seem to be a popular costume this year Kyle.

Mr. Hat

Roar.

-----


Kyle throws off his mask.

Kyle

Dammit!

Stan

Wendy?

Wendy

Hi, Stan.

Stan

You said we were going to be Raggedy Ann and Andy, remember?

Wendy

Yeahhh?

Stan

We were going to enter the costume contest as a pair.

Wendy

I know, but then... I guess I just realized how stupid we would look.

Stan

You what?!

Wendy

I thought you would reach the same conclusion, so, I came as Chewbacca.

-----


Stan bangs his head against a desk.

Bill

Heheh. Heheh.

Fosse

Hey Stan, you look almost pretty enough to kiss.

Bill

Yeah, you want to be my girlfriend? Huhuh.

-----


Stan bangs his head again.

Fosse

Yehaha.

Bill

Huhuh.

Cartman

There, you see? All of a sudden, my costume is pretty badass, huh?

Kyle

Dude, dressing up like Hitler is not badass!

Cartman

You're just jealous! Why don't you go back to Endor you stupid wookie?!

Kyle

Wookies don't live on Endor!

Cartman

[In a mocking voice.] Wookies don't live on Endor.

Kyle

Well at least my mom's not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!

Cartman

What?! What did you say?

Mr. Garrison

Okay now, all you little Chewbaccas take your seats. Children, since today is Halloween, I thought we should learn something about the great horror writer, Jackie Collins. You see, when Jackie Collins first wrote her novel-

-----


Kenny's arm falls off and Mr. Garrison stops.

-----


Wendy looks down at it.

Wendy

Eww.

Mr. Garrison

Is there a problem Kenny?

-----


Silence.

Mr. Garrison

Let's try to keep our hands and arms to ourselves, okay?

Kyle

I'm never gonna win that two tons of candy looking like everybody else!

-----


In front of Cartman's House. Liane is decorating the house and yard, and she sings...

Liane


Oooh, I'm gonna decorate the house for Halloween,
with scary ghosts and bats and creepy crawly things...



-----


She places a poster of Richard Nixon (aka Tricky Dick) on the door. Two zombies, formerly the mortician and Marty, pass by.

Liane

Hello there!

Zombie

Uuuhh.

Liane

Happy Halloween!

Zombie Mortician

Must eat brains.

-----


They attack a passer by, eating his brains and tearing his arms off.

Liane


It's the most wonderful time of the year,
do do do do do do do do-



Passer-by

Aaargh!!! Oh my God!!!

-----


The zombies finish him off.

-----


School Cafeteria.

Kyle

I'm gonna make a new costume during recess. I can still win that candy.

Cartman

Hey Kenny, are you gonna eat your pudding? [As Kenny.] No Eric, go ahead and take my pudding, if you'd like. [As himself.] Why thank you Kenny. How nice of you.

Kyle

Aren't you hungry Kenny?

-----


Kenny just sits there.

Stan

He hasn't moved an inch, or said anything.

Chef

Hello, children.

Kyle, Stan

Hey, Chef.

-----


Chef notices Cartman's Hitler costume.

Chef

What in the hell are you doing dressed up like that?!

Cartman

Eating Kenny's pudding.

-----


Principal Victoria walks up.

Principal Victoria

Hello there, children. Ooh, love the Elvis costume, Chef.

Chef

Elvis? I'm Evel Knievel. Why the hell would I dress up like Elvis?

Principal Victoria

Well, why the hell would you dress up like Evel Knievel?

-----


She turns to the boys.

Principal Victoria

Anyway, I hope that you kids are-Daagh!

-----


Noticing Cartman's costume.

Principal Victoria

Eric! God bless it! what do you think you're doing?!

Cartman

Hey, he said I could have his pudding! Ask him yourself.

-----


As Kenny, poking the side of Kenny's head with a fork for effect.

Cartman

That's right, Principal Victoria. It's okay with me because Eric is cool.

Principal Victoria

Where did you get that costume, young man?!

Cartman

My mom made it. Sieg Heil, Sieg Heil!

Principal Victoria

Shhh! Oh, God bless America.

-----


She grabs Cartman's shoulder; he starts screaming.

Principal Victoria

You get into my office before anyone else sees you. I have to show you an educational video.

Cartman

Eeehh, I don't want to see a educational video-o.

-----


Principal Victoria drags him from the table. Clyde enters the cafeteria with his lunch, and Kenny turns toward him and bites him on the arm.

Clyde

Owww, you bit my arm!

-----


Clyde's arm begins to throb and glow.

Kyle

[Pleased.] Oh, good. Kenny's back to normal.

-----


Principal Victoria's office.

Principal Victoria

Watch the video Eric.

-----


She starts up the VCR. Adolf Hitler is shown and several Nazi soldiers are passing by with guns.

Narrator

Adolf Hitler was a very, very naughty man!

Adolf Hitler

Schnell ach. Lovental bros lieben. Alle Menschen werden Brüder. Doktor Stalin? Alarm! Menchoss? Zellan vei zamboa-

-----


Cartman begins daydreaming of himself as Hitler.

Cartman

Juden est verboten, a den ascriber utz, kapieda hockuh. Juden est verboten, God dammit!

Puffy the Bear

So remember kids, dressing like Hitler in school isn't cool!

-----


Principal Victoria turns off the TV.

Principal Victoria

Now, do you have any questions?

Cartman

[Gleefully.] Could I see that again? That was cool.

Principal Victoria

You must remove that costume, immediately!

Cartman

I can't, I have to win those two tons of candy.

Principal Victoria

Well, how about we make you a new costume. Let's see now.

-----


She spies a white sheet behind Cartman.

Principal Victoria

Aha, thought of something. How about we make you a nice scary ghost costume?

Cartman

[Whining.] I don't wanna be a stupid scary ghost!

Principal Victoria

Aaand, let me just make a few quickie alterations, and there ya go, young man.

-----


Cartman looks suspiciously like a Ku Klux Klan member.

-----


South Park Street. Pack of zombies walks down the street. A pair of joggers are jogging.

Jogger

Ho, looks like they got a touch of that pink eye that's going around.

-----


The zombies attack the joggers, who scream for their lives.

-----


School gym, the costume contest is about to start.

Cartman

Boo! I'm a ghost.

Stan

Oh man, I feel like a total choad.

Cartman

Aw, come on Stan, maybe that's just because you look like a total choad.

Chef

Hello, children.

Cartman

Hey Chef.

Chef

Aaaaah!

-----


Chef runs away

Cartman

Whoa, Chef's really scared of ghosts, huh?

Stan

Hey, where's Kyle?

-----


Kyle bursts in through the doors.

Kyle

Check this out!

Stan

Whoa, dude!

Cartman

What is that?

Kyle

I'm the whole solar system! The planets even all revolve the right way. That tub of candy is as good as mine!

-----


Mr. Garrison blows a whistle.

Mr. Garrison

Okay children, let's get you lined up so the judge can get a good look at your stupid little costumes.

-----


They line up on the stage.

Mr. Garrison

Children, this year we have a celebrity judge, the star of 'Family Ties', Miss Tina Yothers.

-----


Some scattered applause.

Cartman

Who?

Kyle

Dude, I thought she was dead.

Stan

Yeah, me too.

-----


Tina hands Mr. Garrison the results.

Mr. Garrison

Thank you Miss Yothers. Okay, the second place award for best costume goes to... Kenny, for his Edward James Olmos costume.

-----


Tina places a second place ribbon on Kenny.

Mr. Garrison

...And the award for the very best costume goes to... Wendy, for her Chewbacca costume!

-----


Tina places a first place ribbon on Wendy.

Kyle

What?! But she looks just like everybody else. Up yours, Tina Yothers!

-----


Tina looks on shocked.

Mr. Garrison

And the award for worst costume this year goes to... Stan, for his stupid little clown thing costume. Let's all point at Stan and laugh, children. [Everyone laughs.] Yeah.

Stan

Thanks a lot, Wendy! You ruined my Halloween!

Wendy

Relax Stan. You'll feel better once we're out trick-or-treating.

Stan

I don't wanna trick-or-treat with you. You lied to me.

Mr. Garrison

Okay, children. Let's all gather around and bob for stupid apples now. You go first, Bebe.

-----


Bebe begins bobbing for apples.

Mr. Garrison

That's good, just use those mouth muscles like the girls in Beijing.

Clyde

Brainnns. Ahh.

-----


Clyde attacks Bebe, attempting to eat her brains.

Mr. Garrison

Wait your turn Clyde.

-----


Outside Chef's House. Somebody jumps out from behind a bush.

Johnson

Uuuuuuuuuuuuuhh!

Chef

Ah! Damn Johnson, what the hell's gotten into you?

Johnson

Piiink eyyye.

Chef

Get the hell out of here Johnson! I don't want no god damn pink eye!

-----


Chef closes the door and sits down to watch TV.

-----


News 4 Special Report, referring to Mir's crash landing.

Tom

...And the President responded to the incident by saying, quote, "Screw those Commie bastards, and screw their little wussy space station."

-----


The backdrop shifts to a pair of pink eyes.

Tom

In other news, a pink eye epidemic is now sweeping the town of South Park. Here with a live report is a midget wearing a bikini.

-----


Cut to Midget, behind which zombies are shown ransacking the town.

Midget

Thanks Tom, already more than half the townspeople here in South Park have been infected with the pink eye virus.

-----


Zombies are shown attacking another townsperson, and generally ransacking South Park.

Midget

Symptoms include a complete loss of heart functions, blood pressure, lung activity, and of course, sticky puffy eyes.

Chef

Pink eye my ass. I've seen this kind of thing before.

-----


At the bus stop, nighttime.

Cartman

Where the hell is Kyle, we don't have all night to wait for him.

Stan

I bet I get more candy than you dude.

Cartman

Are you crazy?! I'm the candy master.

Stan

No, no, you're the ass master, there's a difference.

Cartman

Hey, I'm not the one who walked around all day looking like Pippi Longstocking.

Stan

Oh yeah? Well, at least my mom's not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!

Cartman

God damn it, my mom is not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!!

-----


Kyle arrives dressed as a vampire.

Kyle

Hey dudes.

Stan

Oh, good, you're here. Now let's make sure we got everything. Flashlight...

Cartman

Check.

Stan

Plastic pumpkin pails...

Kyle

Check.

Stan

Taser...

-----


Stan lights it up.

Kyle

What's that?

Stan

For shocking people who try to give us granola treats, or something.

Cartman

Yeah, granola pisses me off.

-----


Kenny arrives.

Kyle, Stan

Hey Kenny.

Cartman

Whew! Eh, you stink Kenny.

Kyle

You still didn't get a costume Kenny?

-----


Silence.

Cartman

Eh, too bad drinking scotch isn't a paying job, or else Kenny's dad would be a millionaire.

-----


Silence.

Cartman

I said your dad would be a millionaire, get it?! Kenny?! Your family is poor Kenny!! Your family's poor!!!

-----


Silence.

Cartman

I don't like Kenny anymore, he, he just doesn't communicate.

Wendy

Hi guys.

Cartman

Hi Wendy.

Stan

[Pointedly.] How's your barrel full of candy Wendy?

Wendy

Oh, I didn't want all that sweet stuff. I gave it away to hungry children in Nairobi.

Cartman

You what?! Are you insane?!

Wendy

Let's go trick-or-treats.

Stan

I don't think so Wendy, I think you've had enough candy for one day.

Wendy

Stan, I'm awful sorry you got dressed up like Raggedy Andy. Please don't be mad.

Cartman

How can he be mad with such pretty hair and rosy cheeks?

Stan

Trick-or-treat with yourself, Wendy!

Wendy

But Stan!

Stan

No buts, Wendy! I wish you were dead!

-----


The boys walk away. Wendy looks dejected. A low moan is heard and a shadow overcomes her.

Wendy

AAAAAAAAAAAH!

-----


South Park Clinic. A patient turns to the side and coughs.

Chef

Doctor!

Doctor

Why, hello Chef. Let me guess, pink eye, right?

Chef

No, no doctor, I've seen this type of thing before. This ain't no pink eye, it's the living dead.

Doctor

What the hell are you talking about?

Chef

Think about it: Dead people getting up and walking around, and Tina Yothers comin' to town? Coincidence?? Oooh I don't think so!

Doctor

Chef, Ah- I think maybe the pink eye has made you a little delirious. Le- let me give you some, some topical cream.

Chef

Damn it, don't you see? These people have been thematized. They got no heartbeat, no feeling. I'll show you. Errr!

-----


Chef tears off Mr. Torres' arm. Mr. Torres is gushing blood.

Mr. Torres

Aaah!

Doctor

Uhh, Mr. Torres was here for a routine check-up Chef.

Chef

Oh, sorry.

-----


Chef tries to replace Mr. Torres' arm.

Chef

But my point is, that topical cream ain't gonna fix what's wrong here.

-----


Mr. Torres falls over, in shock from blood loss.

Doctor

Hey hey, now, now, there, there have been a lot of incredible advances in topical creams over the last few years.

Chef

Doctor, who is the first person to come in here with the sickness?

Doctor

Well, uh, i- it was the mortician and his assistant at the morgue, yeah.

-----


Zombies burst through the doctor's door.

Chef

Aaaaaaaaaah!

-----


Chef leaps out the doctor's window as zombies close in on the doctor.

Doctor

Now, now, now let's, let's form a line, I've got enough topical cream for everybody.

-----


They attack.

Doctor

Ahh!

-----


In front of a House. The kids ring the doorbell.

The Boys

Trick-or-treat!

-----


Kenny's other arm falls off.

Elderly Woman

Ohh, how cute.

-----


Reaches to place candy in Cartman's pail. Kenny attacks her arm with a vengeance.

Elderly Woman

Aaah!

Stan

Dude, Kenny!

Elderly Woman

Oh, My God! Call 911, call 911!

-----


She retreats and shuts the door.

Cartman

Nice going Kenny, she was about to give us candy.

-----


From inside her home.

Elderly Woman

Call 911!

Stan

Yeah, she had Sweetie Pops.

Cartman

You owe me a Sweetie Pop, asshole!

-----


City Hall. Chef bursts into the Mayor's office.

Chef

Mayor, we've got a big problem.

-----


There is a pile of money on the Mayor's desk. Barbrady is presently wearing a garter and fishnet stockings. The Mayor stands up, her blouse in disarray.

Mayor McDaniels

Ugh!

-----


Gets up from under her desk.

Mayor McDaniels

Why, why Chef. What a surprise!

-----


Chef lets out a sigh of exasperation.

Officer Barbrady

You're probably wondering why we're standing here with a pile of money and no pants on.

Chef

Actually, uh-

Mayor

Well, I can assure you that it has absolutely nothing to do with the Japanese Mafia.

Officer Barbrady

[Wagging his finger.] Not a thingy-dingy.

Chef

I don't really give a crap! We've got to do something about the living dead!

Mayor McDaniels

You mean, Tina Yothers?

-----


Barbrady and McDaniels chortle.

Chef

No, dammit! I'm talking about the zombies that have taken over South Park!

Officer Barbrady

Well, Evel Knievel, why don't you jump over them with your rocket cycle?

-----


Barbrady and McDaniels laugh.

Chef

[Pissed.] Aw, the hell with you both!

-----


leaves the office.

Mayor McDaniels

Well, let's get back to it.

Officer Barbrady

Righty-o.

-----


The Mayor lies down behind the desk.

-----


Another House, another doorbell. A large individual opens the door.

The Boys

Trick-or-treat.

Dude

Hope you kids like chocolate-peanut butter-cream puffies.

-----


Kenny attacks his shoulder.

Dude

Aaah!

-----


Kenny is literally feasting on this guy. The guy twirls around as he says.

Dude

Get it off! Get it off me!! Gaaah!

-----


He falls down, Kenny takes chunks out of his skull and eats them.

Cartman

Damn it! We'll never get any candy if Kenny keeps eating people!

Stan

Yeah! That's it Kenny, you can't trick-or-treat with us anymore!

-----


The boys pass by a house being overrun by zombies.

Somebody

Oh, God!

-----


Yet another house, yet another bell. Three KKK guys open the door.

The Boys

Trick-or-treat.

-----


the Klansmen stare back.

Cartman

Heyy. They're all dressed up like ghosts too.

-----


One of the guys places a single candy in Cartman's pail.

Cartman

One Tootie Bar? You cheap bastards!

-----


Cartman, Kyle, and Stan walk through downtown South Park. Zombies are tearing up the town. Ned and Jimbo can be seen on a rooftop firing at the zombies. Two zombies are playing hot potato with a head.

Female

Oh my God!

-----


A person off to the left is decapitated.

Female

Oh my God!

-----


A zombie picks up a car and drops it on a child.

Female

Nooo!

-----


Chef's House, and the boys ring his bell.

The Boys

Trick-or-t-Aaah!

-----


Chef appears with two chainsaws in hand.

Chef

Get off my property you brain eatin' zombie bastards!

The Boys

Hey, Chef, trick-

Stan, Kyle

Chef! No!

Chef

[Suddenly calm.] Oh, sorry children. I thought you were one of them.

Cartman

Can we have some candy now please?!

Chef

Damn it boy, what in the hell are you doin' dressed up like that?!

Cartman

I'm trying to trick-or-treat God dammit!

Chef

Remind me to whup your ass good next time I see ya. Now, get in here before those zombies getcha!

-----


The kids enter and sit on his sofa.

Stan

What are you talking about Chef?

Chef

Zombies children. South Park is overrun with the living dead. Haven't you noticed anything strange lately?

Kyle

Well, not really, except that Kenny keeps eating people's brains.

Chef

Don't you children see, Kenny's turned into a zombie. Along with everyone else in town.

Stan

Oh my God, that means...

Kyle

If everyone is turned into zombies...

Cartman

Then, there won't be anyone to give us candy!

-----


Stan and Kyle gasp.

Cartman

Aaah!

Kyle

Chef, you've gotta help us!

Chef

I'm working on it children.

-----


Packs the chainsaw.

Stan

Wait, where are we going?

Chef

The doctor said the first people he treated were the mortician and his assistant. Now, I've gotta hunch we'll get to the bottom of this... at the morgue.

-----


Kyle farts. Stan and Cartman laugh.

Cartman

It was Kyle.

-----


South Park Morgue.

Stan

I don't know about this Chef.

Kyle

Yeah, I'm scared.

Cartman

Remember candy, focus on the candy.

-----


Inside the Morgue.

Stan

What are we doing here Chef?

Chef

Just look for anything suspicious.

-----


Kyle looks around the desk.

Kyle

I found it! I found it!

Stan

What?

-----


holding up an issue of Crack Whore magazine, with Liane Cartman on the cover.

Kyle

See Cartman, your mom is on the cover.

Cartman

Eh, shit...

Stan

We told you dude.

Cartman

You guys, shit...

Chef

You better let me take that Kyle.

-----


Chef takes the magazine.

Stan

Hey Chef. Look

-----


Stan and Chef see the embalming fluid, and the knocked over Worcestershire sauce bottle. Chef retrieves the bottle and reads the label, which says:
WARNING!
Not to be used as embalming fluid!
Emergency Hotline

1-800-555-5633

Chef

I gotta call this hotline number children.

-----


Pip bursts through a window.

Pip

Piiink eye!

Cartman

It's the British kid! He's a little limey zombie now!

Pip

Aaah!

-----


More zombies are bursting into the Morgue.

Chef

Look out children!

-----


Four zombies break through a wall. One comes out from a file cabinet. One stands in front of the boys and threatens them. Four more come through the wall next to the window, followed by Kenny. Stan pummels the threatening zombie with a baseball bat and takes him out.

Zombie

Ow, ooh, ow, gowuh-

Stan

Okay Chef, dial the hotline number. Chef?

-----


He looks to his right and sees that Chef is now a zombie, dressed like Michael Jackson in the "Thriller" video.

Kyle

Chef!!!

-----


He begins to dance, and the zombies join him. During the song, the zombies are dancing, as though elaborately choreographed.

Chef


I'm gonna make love, even when I'm dead.
My body might get cold, but it's always hot in my bed.
Make looove, don't you be afraid;
Just because my heart ain't beatin', it don't mean you won't get laid.



-----


Wolf howl, then Chef lets loose a howl.

Stan

Let's get out of here!

-----


The boys leave.

-----


Chef opens his jacket.

Chef

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!

-----


In the cemetery by the morgue.

Stan

We gotta call that Worcecestershire sauce hotline.

Cartman

Hey, there's a pay phone!

Stan

You call the number Kyle.

Kyle

But the zombies are coming!

Stan

We'll hold 'em off.

-----


Kyle quickly presses 3 while Stan and Cartman are both wielding chainsaws and being surrounded by zombies.

Cartman

Nobody screws up my trick-or-treats and gets away with it!

-----


He removes the head and arm from one zombie.

Cartman

Aaah, kew!

-----


Stan removes the heads from two zombies at once.

Stan

Sweet!

-----


More zombies surround Stan and Cartman. Zombie Chef is distracted by the issue of Crack Whore Magazine.

Hotline Voice

Stan and Cartman are laying into zombies, heads are flying everywhere. Cartman takes one zombie in the groin while Stan is shown removing the head from another. Wendy approaches, Stan turns to see who's next.

Stan

Wendy?

Wendy

Aaahahah!

Cartman

Finish her dude, she's a zombie now!

Stan

I know, but uh-... but...

Cartman

Come on Stan! Remember how she dissed you at the costume contest?

Stan

Hey, yeah!

-----


Stan starts revving the chainsaw.

Hotline Voice

For regular sauce, the first thing you need to do is make sure that you do not just go out and start decapitating zombies left and right. Do you understand? Do not start decapitating zombies left and right!

Kyle

Uh, okay. Then what?

Wendy

Aaahh.

Stan

[Apologetically.] Wendy, I know we had a fight, and I did wish you were dead, but, I didn't mean it.

Cartman

Kill her Stan!

Hotline Voice

All you have to do is kill the original zombie. The one that started the whole mess. Once you kill the original zombie, all the others zombies will turn back to normal.

Kyle

Original zombie? Well, how the hell do we know who the original zombie is?!

Hotline Voice

We realize you have a choice in worcestershire sauces, we are delighted that...

-----


Kyle hangs up and stops.

Kyle

Wait a minute, that thing landed on Kenny, and they took him to the mortuary.

Wendy

Aaah!

Stan

I, I can't.

Wendy

Aaah!

-----


Kyle runs in with a third chain saw and cuts Kenny in half.

Kyle

Oh my God! I killed Kenny! You bastard!

-----


Wendy's zombie look fades.

Wendy

Oh, what happened? Stan?

Stan

Don't worry babe. Everything's going to be okay.

Kyle

It's working! They're turning back to normal.

Chef

You did it children!

Cartman

Ok, let's go trick-or-treatin' now, come on!

Wendy

I'm sorry I dissed you at school like that Stan. I guess I just wasn't very considerate of your feelings.

Stan

That's okay Wendy, I'm sorry I wished you were dead.

Wendy

Maybe we could actually kiss tonight Stan.

-----


Puckers up. Stan freezes up and looks ill, then pukes on Wendy.

Wendy

Eww, gross Stan, sick! Barf is gross!

-----


She walks away. Stan just looks on.

-----


Cemetery. The boys are at Kenny's grave. Somber music is playing.

Stan

Oh man, I can't believe he's gone.

Kyle

Yeah, he was too young to be taken from us.

Stan

Dude, you're the one who cut him in half with a chain saw.

Cartman

Let, let us remember the good times, Kenny would have wanted it that way.

-----


Cartman begins to sob uncontrollably. Kyle tries to console him, but refrains.

Stan

You know, I've really learned something today. Halloween isn't about costumes, or candy. It's about being good to one another, and giving and loving.

Kyle

...No, dude, that's Christmas.

Stan

Oh, then, what's Halloween about?

Kyle

Costumes and candy.

Stan

Oh.

-----


Cartman still wailing, then abruptly snaps out of it.

Cartman

Well, let's go home, start eating that candy.

Kyle

We can eat it at Cartman's house, and see more naughty pictures of his mom.

Stan

Yeah.

Cartman

Knock it off you guys, she said she was young, and needed the money.

Stan

Cartman, those pictures were taken like, last month.

Cartman

Lehh, eh, screw you guys!

-----


Somber music plays again. Zoom in on Kenny's grave. Weird music plays as Kenny, newly sewn together, bursts from the grave.

Kenny

(Heeeeyyyy, kick ass.)

-----


A statue of an angel falls on Kenny.

Kenny

(Ow!)

-----


A moment later an airplane crashes into Kenny and the statue.
