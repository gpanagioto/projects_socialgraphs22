==Fictional character biography==
He was shown as dying during ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'',<ref>''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' #3 (June 1985).</ref> although this has been [[retcon]]ned twice to fit in with the later revelation that he was a [[reincarnation]] of Prince Khufu â€” who would later be reincarnated as [[Carter Hall (comics)|Carter Hall]], the [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] [[Hawkman]]. Current continuity has it that he was shot by a criminal named Matilda Roderic,<ref>''Hawkman'' (vol. 4) #7 (Nov 2002)</ref> who was presumably a reincarnation of the evil priest [[Hath-Set]], who is apparently destined to kill Khufu in every life. Roderic's descendant is the current Hath-Set.

The 2002 retcon also revealed he was the partner and lover of the Western heroine [[Cinnamon (comics)|Cinnamon]], who was the reincarnation of Khufu's wife [[Hawkgirl#Shiera Sanders|Chay-Ara]].

Nighthawk appears in [[Guy Gardner (comics)|''Guy Gardner'']] #24<ref>''Guy Gardner: Warrior'' #24 (September 1994).</ref> during the ''[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]'' incident. He sported white sideburns at this point in time. His group of allies, which includes El Diablo and [[Bat Lash]], were forming to take on the villain Extant and several men Extant had brainwashed. Nighthawk calls this group the "Rough Bunch" on more than one occasion. The time-lost heroes [[Steel (comics)|Steel]], Supergirl, Guy Gardner and a version of [[Batgirl]] show up to help in the fight.

A modern-day version of the character appears in the Western-themed ''Robin'' (vol. 2) Annual #6,<ref>''Robin'' (vol. 2) Annual #6 (1997).</ref> as a mercenary. He worked with [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Robin]] and the modern day [[Pow Wow Smith]] to track down the modern day [[Trigger Twins]]. They have a literal Main Street showdown in a Western-themed tourist attraction located near [[Gotham City]].

===The New 52===
Nighthawk appears in ''All Star Western'' in both its backups and in the main Jonah Hex story.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=351}}</ref> Nighthawk's new origin is that he left home as a child and worked on a whaling boat. The captain, a former slave, became a second father to him and Nighthawk was there when the man died. This death inspired Nighthawk to fight for justice and for the oppressed. Nighthawk is teamed with [[Cinnamon (comics)|Cinnamon]] once again. Nighthawk uses a special medallion he found at an Indian burial site which gives him enhanced strength and healing abilities.
