Who is this? I most certainly will not! Now you listen here, Mr. Man! The Galtmans don't believe in social media or the Internet! It's all fake news! Hm.  Sounds like maybe the Galtmans need to check out Randy Marsh.  Galtman residence. I spoke with Mr. Marsh and he denied any wrongdoing. What? This is a violation of my rights. I most certainly will not! If you want me to look at the Internet, I will die first. It's fake news! Oh, VHS is fine. Hmmm... Well well, Mr. Marsh. I'd like to have a word, please. What'd I do?
