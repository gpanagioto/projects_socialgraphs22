Yes it's me. You think you've go' it bad? Oprah hasn't paid any attention to ''me'' in years. Assholes need stimulation too, you bastard! I want to travel. I want to see Paris. I thought lamp was goin' to get better, but Oprah's always busy. Werkin' and werkin', diyatin' and not diyatin'. I need a pukin' up mounds of chocolate cake or teaspoons of weedgrass. Well that'll never happen.  Fired... You got a plan, Mingie? Ooo. How d'you know? 'Ow do we get proof? 'E wants to know who 'e's speakin' with. He wants to know what information we have. Stop wastin' my time. I didn't say "stop wastin' my time," Geraldo did. Hallo? This is Gary. A'right, look. All you need to know is that I'm definitely ''not'' Oprah's asshole.

Not like this, Mingie. Not like this! Jesus Minge! You killed him! You shot him dead! Oh God, I think I'm goinna be sick eh. I can't, uh... I'm goinna puke!  Oh just put down the gun, Mingie. Maybe they'll go easy on us.  Aw Mingie, I'm soo scared.  Mingie. They got me, Mingie. Aye. They got me bad. Oh, the blood. Ih... It's gettin' dark, Minge. I've seen muh life flash before me eyes. Mingie! Where... where are we, Mingie? Are we in Paris? Ahhh... Is it as wonderful as I 'oped? Tell me what you see, Mingie. Ahhh... I can smell them, Mingie. At least I got to see Paris before I-
