 Trying to find my dad. He's supposed to take me to the board game store. Who did? That's a little strange, isn't it? That self-promoting asshole! Because my dad's an idiot! Nnnothing, nothing. We're not old people! You guys are just into lame, vulgar crap, and it needs to be stopped! Yeah, you damn kids! Cartman, please! We have to stop this show! Lorde is going to do something horrible and corrupt little girls everywhere! Because Lorde is my dad, alright?!  Lorde is my dad. He does it all with computers and processors... He got discovered on the Internet. He's like the PewDiePie of music. And he played live last week. Rubbed his clit and started trending more than ever. I thought he had learned his lesson... but it's like he doesn't care. It just all seemed so... stupid. Um, l-look ih if I could just talk to him real quick? I wanna try and stop him from making an ass of himself again. What??  Dude. You're such a grandpa. I'm still really confused, dude. I have no idea what that was about. Yeah. Yeah, I think that's great too.
