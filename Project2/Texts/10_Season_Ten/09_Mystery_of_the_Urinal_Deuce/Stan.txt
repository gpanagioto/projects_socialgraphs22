A wall toilet for peeing in. Did they find out who crapped in the urinal yet? Yeah, at least one-fourth.  Kyle! Dude, do you mind telling me why CIA guys  are coming to my house and questioning me about you?? Well why did you have to involve me?? All right, look, I've been doing a lot of research on the Web and I found an organization who says they can prove you weren't involved in 9/11. Come on. We'll go out the back so they don't see you.  There's just one thing I need to know before we go: you weren't responsible for 9/11, right?  Hi, we were hoping you can help us. My friend is being blamed for 9/11. Dude, why would the government attack its own buildings? JESUS CHRIST!! He was right. You DID cause 9/11. Why?!  Is the whole government in on this?  All right, now we have to switch over to Interbus 65. We made it dude.  We should be home in less than eighteen hours. Then we'll tell everyone what we saw. Yeah, our eyes are finally open, dude. It's like waking up for the first time. Well dude, maybe we're just super badass. Have you thought of that?  What who said? Oh God! Who are you? Aw Jesus... How come you couldn't just go home, dude? That's all we had to do! It was all planned out! Because it was me. I'm the one who took a dump in the urinal. The stalls were full and I didn't wanna miss recess! I didn't think it would turn into such a big deal!  Oh man, now everyone's gonna know. Why did the stupid Hardly Boys have to be so good at solving mysteries? Yuh. Whattaya mean? A bunch of pissed-off Muslims.
