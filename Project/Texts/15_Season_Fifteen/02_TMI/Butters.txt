Skeletor is real?? Skeletor's a lady?? Hey Eric. Is that really all our wiener sizes? Butters Stotch, 2.2 inches. Is that good? A conspiracy? Whoa, it's a little chilly in here. Hey wait, the cold is making it shrink some. Where're you going, little feller? Hang on, he's coming back out. There he is. Who's a little guy? I'm hung like a horse! Homework! I just don't get it! That is the fourth time I've calculated, and it's below average! I thought I was hung, but according to my T.M.I., I have a micropenis!  I don't understand it! An' I'm startin'- uhh, I'm starting to feel angry! Rawr!   Oh what's the point, Mom?! What's the point of life anyway?! All you do is yell at me!

I wanna drive a car that goes, that goes rawr rawr rawrawrawr!
