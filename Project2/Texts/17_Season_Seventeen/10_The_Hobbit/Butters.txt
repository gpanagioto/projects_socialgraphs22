So then, ah, the fella with the mustache eats all the cupcakes, and the lady takes out a gun and puts it in his face and she says "I"-  Oh. Yes? Oh. Oh like a date? Oh no thanks, Lisa. I really appreciate the offer, but you're too fat for me. See ya, Lisa!  Oh. Hey, Wendy. Am I just an asshole? Well, m-no. I've got arms and legs; I've got everything. Ah, I think she's a nice girl too. She's just too big for me. Well Kim Kardashian is skinny and she just had a baby! I'm sorry, Wendy, but I have a different standard when it comes to my women.  I want a woman who takes care of herself and knows how to look good, who's got perfect skin and no splotches on her legs, and perfect everything. You're a liar! You did! You said Kim was short, fat, and hairy with big feet and she's a hobbit! Oh, she said it again! Oh no, you don't, Wendy! You're not trappin' me inside the computer lab to beat me up! Well, alright, but if you try to punch me, I'll scream!  Okay. That's Lisa Berger? She's pretty! Hold on. Are you saying that girl wants to go out with me? And I said no? Oh man, I gotta upload this  Lisa? Lisa Berger? Anybody seen Lisa Berger?  Oh hey, Eric. Have you seen Lisa Berger anywhere? II know! I'm gonna tell her I love her, and we're gonna be together and be happy forever. What?! Well since when? No way! Go back to Annie Nelson! She's built like a Slim Jim!  I do love water balloons.
