South Park Elementary, day. The boys are indeed back at school, their crowdfunding venture having fizzled on the fires of an offensive trademark. Students head to their classrooms. The main four come in looking bright and ready to go

Kyle

Hey guys!

Stan

Morning!

Cartman

How's it going, everybody?

Kyle

Sup, Jason? [Jason turns and walks away angrily]

Cartman

Hey dude. Sup? [they encounter Tolkien, Craig, and Jimmy.]

Craig

What are you guys doing here?

Cartman

What do you mean? We're just... going to school.

Jimmy

I thought you guys said you didn't need school.

Tolkien

Yeah, you said you had a startup company and that school was for douchebags.

Kyle

Oh! Tha-oh, yeah, the the startup company thing didn't really work out.

Craig

But you told us all to go fuck ourselves.

Cartman

Ogh! Noo, noo, you guys, guys, what what we said was-

Craig

[keeps pressing] You told us your company was gonna make $10 million, and the rest of us could go fuck ourselves.

Kyle

We were- trying to be funny.

Jimmy

Yeah well, no one's laughing, Kyle. [Tolkien, Craig and Jimmy split up, then everyone else goes their separate ways. Moments later, Wendy is shown at her locker]

Stan

[walks up] Hey Wendy.

Wendy

You're... back?

Stan

Yeah, the startup company thing didn't work out.

Wendy

[sarcastic] Oh wow, I'm shocked.

Stan

So hey, I was gonna see if you still wanted to see that stupid Maze Runner movie-

Wendy

You broke up with me, Stan! You said you had to be "free to chase your dreams".

Stan

Wendy, I thought my life was going in a different direction and I just felt that I, I really had to give it everything I had, you know. I had I had to focus on one thing.

Wendy

Is that why you told Clyde that you broke up with me? Because you're about to be [does air quotes] "dripping in bitches"?!

Stan

Huh? Why does everyone suddenly remember everything everybody says? [Wendy closes her locker and faces him]

Wendy

I'm happy, Stan. I'm happy I know who you really are now. You're someone who can't be counted on! You're someone who can just bail on the people you love! [turns around and walks away]

-----


The cafeteria, lunchtime. Cartman looks around

Cartman

Dude, people are pissed off at us.

Kenny

(Yeah, it's fucking crazy!)

Kyle

Doesn't anyone understand the significance of "I'm sorry" anymore?

Cartman

Yeah! Well said, Kyle! Good point! What, what happened to the significance?

Kyle

Well, I guess let's just be thankful we're not Butters. They won't even let him come back to school.

-----


Faculty room

Pricipal Victoria

All right everyone, thanks for coming. As you know, we urgently need to discuss the matter of Butters Stotch, who set fire to the school gymnasium and is now asking to come back. Are we all set to start?

Woman

Almost. We're just waiting on Mr. Mackey. Again.

Mr. Adler

Awww, do we need Mackey here?

Mr. Garrison

Yeah, all he's gonna talk about is how he's gluten-free now and feels sooo fuckin' amazing.

Principal Victoria

Well, you have to admit he does look a little better.

Mr. Adler

He doesn't look any different to me.

Principal Victoria

In the cheeks, you don't think he looks a little fuller?

Mr. Garrison

It's just the new diet fad! [a door opens]

Mr. Mackey

Sorry I'm late. I had to stop and get my own breakfast because I figured y'all would be having doughnuts, but I'm actually gluten-free, so I can't have doughnuts, m'kay?

Principal Victoria

Yes, Mr. Mackey, we're all aware that you're gluten-free now.

Mr. Mackey

I'm just sayin' that I personally feel sooo fuckin' amazing

Mr. Garrison

[exasperated, face in his hands] Can we discuss the gymnasium and get out of here, please?

Principal Victoria

Right, so the issue, as you all know, is that Butters set fire to the gymnasium last week and ran away laughing and flipping everyone off.

Mr. Mackey

That's probably gluten, m'kay?

Coach

Oh, God!

Mr. Mackey

Gluten causes sluggishness, irritability, and nearly all behavioral problems,

Mr. Garrison

I seriously cannot take hearing about gluten anymore.

Mr. Mackey

See, that's probably the gluten talkin', uhkay? If you cut out gluten, you don't ever get pissed off.

Principal Victoria

[surprized and interested] Really? Mwell I might just give this gluten-free thing a try. How does it work?

Mr. Garrison

Oh, no, don't try- oh God, here we go.

-----


The school gym, day. Gutted by the fire, but not condemned. The fourth graders are inside during their PE period. The girls jump rope, the boys try to make baskets through a badly damaged hoop. Other boys toss basketballs at each other, while Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny sit on the burnt bleachers.

Kyle

I don't know what we're going to do? It's been like four hours and people still won't talk to us.

Kenny

(Right. What the fuck is going on?)

Cartman

You know what we gotta do, guys? [gets off the bleachers] We've gotta throw a big fuckin' party

Kenny

(A party?!)

Cartman

Yeah! How do you make everyone like you? You have a big party and invite everyone and then everyone thinks you're cool!

Kyle

Dude, that would have to be like, the best party ever.

Cartman

Well I'm down. Between the four of us we can throw the sweetest party ever, and these assholes won't even remember us being dicks to them.

Kyle

[joins him on the floor] Hey, that might work. But it can't be a party for us.

Cartman

Right, it's gotta be an awesome party for...

Stan

[joins them on the floor] For someone that we love who needs us and that we refuse to bail on!

Cartman

What?

Kyle

No no, he's right! We've gotta make it for someone in need so that people have to go.

Cartman

We lure people in with a cause and then hit 'em over the head with the best party ever. We're gonna have pizza and cake and a sweet band!

Kyle

A band! Holy shit, Stan! Didn't you say your dad knows somebody who knows Lorde?

Stan

Yeah, he said some guy at work is Lorde's uncle or something.

Cartman

Oh my God, we've got Lorde to play live.

Kenny

(This will be awesome!)

Cartman

So who do we throw the party for?

Stan

What do you mean? We have a friend who needs us right now, and we can't let him down. [Pink's "Get This Party Started" begins to play, which serves as transitional music to the next scene]

-----


WSPIC 88.3, on air. The Camera pans down to the DJ

DJ

All right, that was "Get This Party Started" and joining me in the studio now are four local boys who are gearing up to throw the most epic party ever. Is that right, boys?

Kyle

Yeah, it's going to be this weekend.

Cartman

You know, we just wanted to give back to the community and show everyone a good time.

DJ

Now, this party is also for a good cause, because it's to honor a little boy with diabetes, Scott Malkinson. Is that correct?

Cartman

You, you know diabetes affects us all, but it mostly affects Scott Malkinson.

Stan

Yeah, and we just- you know, we, we just can't turn our back on him.

DJ

Must be pretty special having a big party in your honor, Scott. How does it feel?

Scott

I actually have plans this weekend.

Cartman

"I actually have plans this weekend. I'm Scott Malkinson. I've got diabetes."

DJ

All right, well, we've got lots of people callin' in. Caller, what's your question?

Craig

Are you guys making this up?

Kyle

Nope! We're gonna have all the pizza you can eat, twenty different cakes, and Lorde is going to play live!

Craig

All the pizza we can eat?

Cartman

Believe it, dude.

Craig

All right, this better be good.

DJ

All right, it's sure to be a blast. Phone lines are going craaazy!

Stan

Sweet!

DJ

Next caller, what's your question?

Principal Victoria

Yes, will there be gluten-free options for people at this party?

Stan

Excuse me?

Principal Victoria

Well I've been gluten-free for about a day now, and I have to say I feel sooo amazing. I just want to make sure there's food for all of us.

DJ

Mark in Fairplay, you had a comment?

Mark

Yeah, I agree with the last caller. I was in a restaurant and ordered the gluten-free quinoa salad, and a guy right next to me was eating a sandwich. It's like "Get your second-hand gluten away from me!"

DJ

All right, all right, next caller, you got a question for the boys?

Mr. Garrison

Yeah, I swear, if I hear another person talking about being gluten-free I'm gonna piss in their face.

Cartman

What the hell is gluten?

-----


Park County community center, night. Most everyone in town is at the meeting tonight.

John Garner

Hello everyone, my name is John Garner and I'm a nutrition advisor from the USDA. I want to clarify the USDA's position on a healthy diet. There's been a lot of confusion about gluten lately. People saying that gluten is the cause of cancer, gluten should be avoided, gluten can make your dick fly off, but let's set the record straight.

Randy

[To Gerald] Make your dick fly off?

John Garner

People believe that omitting gluten will make you healthier, but of course, that's a bunch of hooey. Hooey is the preservative found in processed foods, that we now believe is the main culprit of obesity. You might say "Well there's fat in butter too," but that's just poppycock. Poppycock first came from India and is the key ingredient in red meat which we now realize is good for you along with hooey. The good hooey, not the bad hooey. So what is gluten?

Mr. Garrison

Yes, thank you!

John Garner

Simply put, gluten is the protein found in flour when you take all the starch away. [holds up a stalk of wheat]. Flour is of course, just wheat, and when you add a liquid to flour, you get dough. [grabs a wad of dough] Dough that makes breads, doughnuts, pasta, and all the hooey-free foods that humans enjoy. [puts the dough into a special washer. The extract going through a distillation process] Now, if we wash the dough of all its starch, we can actually distil the wheat down, minus the water, minus the starch, and what we're left with is pure gluten. Not a bio-weapon, just harmless flour protein.

Mr. Mackey

Then eat it!

John Garner

Excuse me?

Mr. Mackey

If it's not dangerous, then eat that pure concentrated gluten, okay?

John Garner

[looks at the gluten, then at the audience, then moves the gluten to his lips] Yeah. Alright. [sips it down] Dup, dup. [his body contorts as he groans. Everyone in the audience begins to panic. He shows signs of burning up, and his groin begins to set off electrical sparks. His penis wriggles out of there and soon launches itself.]

Mr. Mackey

Oh, you see that? His dick's flyin' off. [people begin to leave the community center. The penis escapes and comes back to knock a man down]

-----


Papa John's Pizza is shown. The townsfolk run right past it.

Stephen

[stops] Oh my God! These people don't even know! [faces the pizza joint] Hurry! You gotta go!

Mr. Garrison

[stops as well] Oh Jesus! Hey! It isn't safe in there! [inside, two workers just stand around behind the counter] Get out of there!

Stephen

Get out! You're not safe!

Mr. Garrison

You gotta get out!

Stephen

Hurry! You gotta go!

-----


The Marsh kitchen. Randy opens the cupboard and pulls everything out of it, including foods like Choc-Block Cookies, Circus Cookies, Fudge-Stuffed Fingerlings, Granny's Mac 'n Cheese, Frosted O-Face-O's and Puffed Up. Sharon does the same at another cupboard, removing items like Candy Corn Oreos, Thwizlerz and Cheesey Poofs; packing them in a white garbage bag with other foods like Hamburger Helper, Fiber-O's, Muffin Top, Chicken Nuggets and Beef Burritos. They're both in a panic. Shelly and Stan appear at the kitchen entrance.

Randy

What about the Powerbars? The Powerbars?

Sharon

Yes!

Randy

Hamburger Helper?

Sharon

That's all gluten!

Randy

There's hot dog buns in that cupboard, Sharon!

Sharon

Hey, dad, I need to talk to you about this party we're having.

Randy

Oh my God, the WHEAT THINS!

Sharon

It's in the Triscuits too, Randy!

Stan

Wait, wait, ah I might need those.

Randy

This stuff will make your dick fly off, Stan!

Sharon

Don't forget the freezer!

Randy

Oh God! [now clearing the freezer] Chicken nuggets - breaded! Frozen burritos - flour! Ice cream! What about ice cream?!

Sharon

I don't know! Look at the ingredients!

Randy

Heavy cream, sugar, chocolate syrup - no, ice cream's good for you!

Sharon

All right, that's all of it!

Randy

You sure? All r- all right, you got those?!

Sharon

I can get both of these, yeah!

Randy

All right, come on! [a loaf of whole wheat sandwich bread falls out. Moments later, Randy comes back for it, then leaves again]

-----


Kyle's room, night. Kyle is working on the party's budget when his phone rings. It's Cartman

Kyle

Hey Cartman.

Cartman

KYLE! IT'S ALL GONE! THEY'VE TAKEN IT ALL! WHY ARE THEY DOING THIS?! KYLE! KYLE!

Kyle

Dude, calm down.

Cartman

THERE'S NO SNACKS LEFT, KYLE! THEY TOOK ALL THE SNACKS AND THE PIZZA AND THE CAKE AND WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE A PARTY!

Kyle

Who took all the pizza and the cake? [begins to notice flickering lights outside his window and hears an approaching crowd. All the gluten-tainted food that people have been bagging is being thrown into a bonfire] What the hell?

Cartman

KYYYLE!

-----


A wheat field outside of town. Rolling hills of wheat are shown when the start turning brown. A flamethrower begins burning the field. A man wielding the flamethrower appears walking methodically through the field

Mr. Garrison

Yeah! Get it! Get it all! Yeah, that's it! Burn, you bastard!

Farmer

What are you doing?!? My farm!

Randy

Son of a bitch! Did you not know or did you just not care?! Keeyah! [knocks him down with a right punch to the right cheek]

-----


U.S.D.A. Strategic Command Center, FDA approved, day.

Tom Vilsack

There's panic all over the country and you're telling me you don't have any kind of containment on this thing?!

Researcher

We're working as fast as we can, sir.

Tom Vilsack

[sighs loudly] Are you sure it's gluten that started the reaction?

Researcher

[they stop by a rat cage] We gave these rats an injection of concentrated whole wheat bread just a short time ago. You can see it already having a negative effect. [the rat is having an arousal it can't control. It flips over on its back, its penis wriggling out and shooting off. The rat dies.]

Tom Vilsack

We told people that whole wheat bread was healthy! Isn't wheat the ingredient in pasta that makes it healthy?

Researcher

No. We believe now that that's poppycock.

Tom Vilsack

[to everyone on the floor] All right, listen up! We have the obligation to make this thing right and to tell people what is and isn't safe to eat. We are the USDA! Without us, people would be eating dirt and... chairs. Whatever it takes, stop this crisis! [turns left and leaves. Another rat in the background loses its penis and dies.]

-----


Cartman's room. Cartman is in bed with a slight cough. He blows his nose, and his door opens. the boys enter

Kyle

Cartman? Come on, dude. You have to get up.

Cartman

What's the point? Everyone hates us at school and our party's gonna suck.

Stan

We can't let our party suck.

Cartman

What kind of epic party can you have without pizza and cake? Now all we've got is Lorde.

Kyle

That's right, we've still got Lorde. You talked to your dad, right Stan?

Stan

[looks down, then] I'll be back. [turns and leaves]

Cartman

You know what I'mm gonna miss most? Pancakes. I keep having dreams of Aunt Jemima. She's trying to tell me something. But then she just fades away.

Kyle

Cartman, we can't do this alone. You have to get up.

Cartman

[turns to his right side] There's nothing left, you guys! The world is upside down. Things aren't gonna get better, they're gonna get worse.

-----


The Marsh house. The bell rings and Randy answers it.

Randy

Yes?

Worker 1

Hello, sir. We've had word of a possible gluten exposure in your home. May we come in?

Randy

Gluten expohn... oh not here!

Worker 2

Can we come in please?

Randy

Wuh sure! [shows them in. They enter and their gluten meters crackle as they go around the house]

Sharon

[coming down the stairs] What's going on? [one of the workers stops at the kitchen wastebasket and pulls out a pair of tongs. He rifles through the trash can with it and pulls out a Pabst Blue Ribbon can]

Randy

Well that's just a beer.

Worker 1

Oh Jesus.

Shelly

BEER IS ALL WHEAT, DAD!!

Randy

[to Shelly] Shuut up, [to the worker] beer is bad for you?!

Worker 2

We're gonna need you to come with us, sir. Don't touch me.

Randy

Look, I'm OK! Yuh, you wanna see my dick?

Worker 1

We just need you to be in quarantine for a while until everyone figures out what's going on.

Randy

No! Not Papa John's. [shakes his head] I don't wanna go to Papa John's! [shakes his head more violently] YOU CAN'T MAKE ME GO TO PAPA JOOOHN'S!!

-----


Papa John's, day. It is now Gluten Quarantine Center 1, and Randy's the newest quarantine. Outside are one of the workers and a soldier

Randy

How long do I have to stay here?!

Soldier

Until the USDA gets control of the situation, sir.

Randy

What am I supposed to eat?

Soldier

It's okay, there's lots of toppings. Just eat the toppings. [the soldier and the worker walk away]

A Quarantine

How'd you get exposed? [it's a blond man on the floor] Bagels? Gravy?

Randy

Beer. I didn't know it had gluten.

Mr. Garrison

There's always somethin'. For me it was the soy sauce. [his voice grows soft] Sneaky, sneaky soy sauce.

-----


USDA headquarters, day

Jeff

We're trying to get a handle on just how much gluten there is out there, but... It seems impossible to contain.

Tom Vilsack

And we have no idea how to tell people to protect themselves?

Researcher

[approaches with an open laptop] We've been running simulations, but they're problematic because they don't relate to our current schematics. Here, look. This is what we've been recommending for the past three years. [Shown is a food tray with dish and cup on it. The dish has larger portions for veggies and grains, smaller portions for fruits and proteins, and the cup is dairy, off to the side with the smallest portion] Five basic food groups, not four. We were wrong about that. We now realize, of course, that the largest of these groups we've been recommending is basically poison [a skull and crossbones appears over the grains]. Sir, to combat the gluten, we're trying every possible combination of the four remaining food groups, but so far, no answers.

Agent

Sir, the feds are here.

Tom Vilsack

Oh shit!

FDA agent 1

Tom Vilsack?

Tom Vilsack

Yes?

Michael Taylor

Michael Taylor, FDA.

Tom Vilsack

Yeah, thank you, but this is a USDA problem.

Michael Taylor

Anything involving meat and dairy is our problem too!

-----


Papa John's, day. Stan approaches the blocked entrance

Stan

Dad? Dad!

Randy

[appears through a window] Stan! ...Hey! ...How's my boy? Daddy's gonna be all right. Okay?

Stan

Yeah. Dad, you know that guy at work you said is Lorde's uncle or something?

Randy

I can't touch you or hug you, but... but I'm right with you. Do you understand?

Stan

Yeah. You remember you said that Lorde, the singer, her uncle worked with you?

Randy

How's your mom? Your, your sister?

Soldier 2

[appears next to him and begins tugging at him] This is a quarantined area, kid. You're you're gonna have to go.

Stan

Nonono, not yet. DAD!

Randy

That's my son, you bastard!

Soldier 2

I'm sorry, all right?

Stan

Dad, who's the guy at work that knows Lorde? Let me go! DAD!

Randy

Staaan!

Stan

Let me talk to my dad! [the soldier finally hauls him away]

Randy

Staaaaaaan!

-----


Cartman's room, night. He's asleep. A nightmare comes on, and visions of fellow students pass through his dream

Craig

You call this a party?! Your party sucks!

Tolkien

Come on guys, let's go!

Jimmy

No food at a party? And I thought I was handicapped! [the voices mount and soon he's lifted out of bed as one last kid says "What a loser" which echoes and fades away. He finds himself in bayou territory]

Aunt Jemima

Hello, Eric. [he sees her, on a porch, with a plate of pancakes] Come on over here, sugar.

Cartman

Aunt Jemima. [stands up and walks over]

Aunt Jemima

There's people in trouble, Eric. They need to be shown the way.

Cartman

I don't know the way, Aunt Jemima.

Aunt Jemima

You need to get to the USDA, child. They're lookin' for a sign.

Cartman

I don't even know what that means.

Aunt Jemima

When you're stuck, look to the pyramids.

Cartman

Are you going to eat those pancakes?

Aunt Jemima

They've got it wrong, child! [suddenly the scenery changes to the pyramids at Giza. Her voice takes on a cosmic tone, and Cartman spins in place] The world is upside down.

Cartman

Oooo, trippy...

Aunt Jemima

Tell then they've got's it backwards!

Cartman

They've got what backward? [everything vanishes into a gray field, then a golden triangle appears, then shatters. A kaleidoscope of kids appears, taunting him. Aunt Jemima's face shatters, revealing the golden triangle.]

Cartman

[he falls through his dream, surrounded by everything that has gluten in it] Noooo... [and suddenly wakes up] Oh! Ohhh, oh. Hoooh. Fuck, I want pancakes.

-----


Papa John's, day. establishing shot. Inside Randy sits on a cot

Randy

You can't just keep us in here!

Mr. Garrison

[clanging] We're out. [holds up an empty tray] We're all out of toppings! There's nothing left to eat.

Blond

[looks outside, then] They're just gonna let us starve to death?

Randy

They don't care about us. Face it. We're already dead to them. [buries his face in his hands]

Blond

Well then, I guess I might as well eat! [stands up and walks towards the storage room]

Mr. Garrison

There's nothing left, I told you.

Blond

There's plenty of pizza dough.

Randy

Are you crazy?

Blond

I'm crazy hungry! [takes a wad of dough and begins eating it] Oh... Oh... Fuck, it's so good! [Randy and Mr. Garrison wait for the other shoe to drop] I want more... It's been so long! [gets more dough and eats voraciously]

Randy

Oh my God, you... [the blond stops eating] But... you're okay.

Blond

You don't think it's a little ridiculous that wheat protein is toxic? This whole thing was a setup, man!

Mr. Garrison

A setup? But by who?

Randy

Oh my God, we... we have to get a hold of someone who could get the word out.

Blond

Maybe Papa John can help us! If we can get a hold of them, then maybe we can- [his penis suddenly and quickly flies off and he dies]

Randy

Ng-oh. [snaps his fingers. He and Garrison go find seats]

-----


WSPIC 88.3, on air. Stan is reading an announcement

Stan

There's a health crisis going on, and it's spreading faster than anyone realizes. For a long time we ignored it. Thought it would only affect the poor. People who ate Eggo waffles and Pizza Pockets. But gluten can attack anyone. This is not a time to party. This is a time to get serious. We're calling on everyone to spend this weekend learning about gluten and how to protect yourself and your family. Because we don't know how much time we have.

DJ

Well all right, time for action indeed. Let's go to the phone lines. Go ahead, caller.

Craig

I knew you guys were going to bail on the party.

Kyle

We're not bailing on the party, we're just think there's... more important things right now!

Craig

Uh huh, you guys couldn't get Lorde to play, could you?

DJ

All right, let's go to Jamie in Como. Go ahead.

Jamie

It's like ya... ya say you're gonna throw the most epic party of the decade and then you rip it away! It's kind of like.... telling everyone to go fuck themselves!

DJ

Oh Kansas, watch the language there. Next caller, you're on the air.

Wendy

Why are you doing this party, Stan? Was it because you made people mad at school or... because you just wanted to be a big shot?

Stan

I... we... we wanted to bring people together and help Scott Malkinson, but-

Wendy

So then at a time when people really need to come together you cancel on 'em? I'm pretty sure Scott Malkinson still has diabetes.

Scott

That is correct, yes, I do.

Wendy

You couldn't put on the party you were hoping to put on, was that it?

Kyle

Jesus Christ, dude.

Stan

Wendy, there IS a health crisis right now...

Wendy

Right, and when things change or things come up, you don't forget about everything you promised people!

Stan

We had no idea what to serve people to eat, okay?! We're gonna look stupid!

Wendy

Thought so. [hangs up. Stan lets his head fall on the table]

DJ

Ohhhhhh well all right, next caller is Eric. Are you there, Eric?

Cartman

KYYYLE!

Kyle

Cartman?

Cartman

KYYYLE, WHAT DOES USDA STAND FOR?! AUNT JEMINA SAID USDA HAS TO LOOK AT THE PYRAMID!

-----


USDA headquarters, day. Everyone is in a rush.

Tom Vilsack

It's dinner time on the East coast in less than an hour. People are going to die!

Jeff White

Sir! They've got a boy on the hot line who says he might know something.

Tom Vilsack

Who is this?

Cartman

My name isn't important. What matters is that... the answer is in the pyramid.

Tom Vilsack

The pyramid? That's ancient stuff you're talking about. Are you sure? [to the floor] Bring up the pyramid! [a programmer gets on it. An image comes up on screen, showing four food groups in four layers inside a pyramid. Grains take the bottom, widest layer, followed by fruits and vegetables, meat and dairy, and fats and oils narrowing to a point at the top]

Cartman

What, what is it? What is it for?

Tom Vilsack

We built the pyramid a long time ago to illustrate how much people should eat of the four basic food groups.

Programmer

Sir, we abandoned the pyramid when Michelle Obama got involved.

Tom Vilsack

The pyramid down't work. We already tried it.

Cartman

It's upside down.

Tom Vilsack

What?

Cartman

Sir, the pyramid is upside down.

Tom Vilsack

Turn the pyramid upside down.

Programmer 2

You can't be serious. That would put butter and fat at the top of the-

Tom Vilsack

Flip the damned food pyramid!

Michael Taylor

This is NOT FDA-approved!

Tom Vilsack

It's dinnertime on the east coast in ten minutes! Now DO IT! [the programmers get on it]

Programmer 3

Sir, we've got a match.

Programmer 4

Nutrition is stabilizing!

Programmer 5

We've got a well-balanced vaccine, sir! [everyone cheers]

Tom Vilsack

Get the President on the phone. Tell him... to have some steak with his butter.

-----


The awesome party, day. The boys came through, everyone in town is there. Mr. Garrison serves steaks with large bars of butter to Mr. Mackey and Principal Victoria. "We love you Scott." Photo booth, soda station

Craig

[with butter on a stick] Well, I gotta admit, you guys throw a pretty sweet party.

Kyle

Hey, we'd do anything for our bros, man.

Scott

[approaches with a plate of butter on a stick] Would you guys care for a frozen butter pop?

Kyle

We're good, Scott. Stop bugging us. [Scott walks away]

Tom Vilsack

We really dodged a bullet, young man. Thanks to you, America knows what to eat again.

Cartman

Yeah well, I'm glad people aren't mad at you anymore. I know what that feels like.

Tom Vilsack

We're gonna get a better view of the stage.

Cartman

Yeah yeah, enjoy the party. [takes a couple of steps and notices the ghost of Aunt Jemima over a fence. He waves at her. She waves back.]

Jeff White

Wait till my girls see that I was at a party with Lorde!

Clyde

I'm glad the food is good. Lorde sucks.

Jimmy

Yeah, she isn't as hot in person.

Randy

[dressed up as Lorde]
 Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. I am Lorde, yeah yeah yeah. Lorde, Lorde. Call me Lorde yeah yeah yeah. Yeah yeah yeah.



Stan

Hey Wendy, you havin' fun?

Wendy

Yeah, sure. You guys really pulled it off.

Stan

Yeah, well, I just couldn't sit around while my dad was locked away. I love him and he needed me.

Wendy

You're so transparent, Stan.

Stan

What does that mean?

Wendy

You wanna dance? [he looks back at her, smiles, and goes to dance with her.]

Randy


We love the city, yeah yeah yeah, 'cause I am Lorde. I am Lorde. Lorde Lorde Lorde Lorde yeah yeah yeah.
