 Do I have to go? It's the only day I get to play games.  ...Don't understand why we have to go to church every Sunday. I really don't understand the point of all that. But back then I don't know if church was that stupid. How many cards do you start with, Kenny? Okay, so I-I guess I'm gonna go to the saloon and try to arrest Cartman. I didn't invite him.   Uh, excuse me. What are you doing? Well, I mean, it looks like you're scrubbing and bleaching our tables and chairs. Yeah he was. I played with him. What's a Kumby? I have no idea what's going on.
