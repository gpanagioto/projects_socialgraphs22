 And I don't want no new cellmate! Oh, I will!  You bet your ass I will. Well, well, well. New fish. How about you come up with a reason why we ''don't'' break your arms?! Oh yeah? The way I see it, there's two kinds of kids in the world: kids who like ''Animaniacs'', and kids who don't like ''Animaniacs''. You're either with us, or you're against us. So which are you?!  ...Neither do we No! There's no friends in the Big House! You come in with nobody and you leave with nobody. We don't believe in "friends." Now, go find me some cigarettes and I'll tell you how to bust out of here.  Well, did you get the cigarettes? Alright. Go sit on the toilet and poop them out. I'll keep an eye out for the guards.  You flushed them?! No way, douche. I told you: I ain't your friend. If you want me to help you, you're gonna have to sneak something else in for me.  Ew, it smells, man. You're ''not'' gonna break out of here! You're here 'til you're 21, douche! I just wanted you to sneak stuff in for me. What? You actually think I give a crap about you? Hneah. You'd better wise up to the way things work in the big house.  You... you can't cry in prison, man. They'll bust your head open. What's the matter with you?! Dude.  Look, if it's that important to you, I'll bust you out of here. Yeah. ...Yyeah, I will. Uh-but not because you're my friend. Only because... because I wanna bust out, too. Anh-anh, and see Disneyland. Hurry up! They're sending the dogs after us!  Mph. Oowww!  You go on ahead without me. Hey.  You're supposed to say, "I'm not going without you," or something. Look, kid, you go on. You've got something to live out there. You've got friends. I sure would have liked to have seen Disneyland. Here. I want you to have these.  No! You're supposed to say, "I can't take these," or something, dumbass! Take them. They'll bring you luck.  Yeah? Eric! Wow! I've never had a visitor before! You did?  Yeah.  Whoa!  Oh, yeah! Oh, the monorail!
