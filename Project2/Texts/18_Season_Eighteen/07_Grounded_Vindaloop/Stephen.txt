There you are, mister! Just what do you think you're doing?! I know that! What do you-? Ohhh! Oooooo! Ohhh! What kind of person did we raise you to be?! You think this world is just there for your amusement?! You are not to leave this room, and you are not allowed to use the phone or the computer! Oh no, mister. You are GROUNDED!  Butters?! Who is that?!  Well, this looks like a lovely meal. Too bad Butters won't be enjoying it. You hear that, mister?! No dinner for you! While you're grounded you can just GO TO BED HUNGRY! Linda, do you remember ''why'' Butters is grounded? What, what did he do? It's strange. I don't recall him really doing anything particularly bad, and yet... and yet he ''is'' grounded.  And no bouncing the racquetball either!  Butters! What are your friends doing here?! You just don't get it, do you?! What is wrong with you?! Well, you're getting it now! Oh my gosh! Linda! It's Butters. He's not grounded anymore. No. I've I've got to tell him!  You can go outside and play, son. No. I don't know why or how, but... it's over.
