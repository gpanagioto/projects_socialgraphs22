Somebody help us!  Kyle, hurry!   Oh God! Noo nono, I'm not getting in a pool with Kenny. He has herpes. Look at his lip.  You've got herpes, dude. No- cold sore is what girls call it, Kenny. It's actually herpes. Hey yeah, ziplining! That could be really cool! Ziplining. Hell yeah. Hey Kenny! You got herpes, dude! Ah I almost touched him.  Oh, sick Kenny! No! Gross. Heh, did you hear that guys? Kenny said it's just a fever blister.  You sound like a chick, Kenny. That's herpes, dude. You got that shit till you die. Alright! ...No. Finally! Well, come on, we don't have a choice.  Mmmm, no? The trees' biology? Yeah.  Yeah. Zipliiine.  Totally fuckin' stupid, dude! Yeah dude, it's fuckin' boring as shit! NOOOO! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!   We should have never listened to you, Kyle. Yeah you! In the park this morning?! "I know, let's all go ziplining! We've never done that before!" I brought it up because you already brought it up! Fuck you Kyle! Nnnn-mo... Oogh! Ugh! You guys, seriously! Something's wrong in my tummy!  This is Diet Double Dew Kyle! It only has half the caffeine and sugar of Double Dew.  Oh man, you guys, I gotta get to a bathroom fast. If I crap in the woods, the blood will attract beavers, Kyle! NOOO!   Eeeeugh. Uh oh.  A marina? Well it's not my diarrhea's fault that you took us all ziplining, you fuckin' Jew! Kenny, whose idea was it to go ziplining? Mine, or Kyle's? WAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! I'm not sharing with Kenny. He has herpes! No, not they, YOU! Look what your ziplining idea has done! You killed Kenny, YOU're the bastard! You?!  You came for us!
