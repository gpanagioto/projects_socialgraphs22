That monster is sitting right over there, and his name is Terrance!  All of these things link Terrance to the murder: hair fibers, blood samples, nail clippings, a piece of his shirt, Terrance, you may be a famous surgeon, but you're not God. ''J'accuse'', Terrance. Your Honor, the defense is trying to make a mockery of this court! They think that farts are funny, but they're not!  Goddammit! That isn't funny!  Well, looks like you got away with it, Terrance and Phillip! There ''are'' hard feelings! This isn't over. I'm going ta see to it that you both pay for what you've done. And do you know why? No, Because I hate you. You think farting is so funny. Well, it isn't!! Fart jokes are the lowest form of comedy, and if I-- Ugh! I hate you both! I've hated you ever since I could remember! I hate you, and I wish you both had cancer. Yes. In the head. This is not the end, Terrance and Phillip! You'll rue this day!  Hello? Yess, yes it is. Yes. I'm a television critic for a magazine. Yes! Yes I do! They think that fart jokes are a sophisticated form of comedy, but they're not! Who is this?  Saddam Hussein? The Iraqi dictator? What do you want? I'm not sure I should trust you. Scott to Red Dragon, come in, Red Dragon. The plan is working perfectly. Terrance and Phillip have taken the bait. Yes. Everything's proceeding according to plan. Now you promised that when Terrance and Phillip arrive they'll be ripped into pieces and shot several times. Roger, Red Dragon. Scott out.  I've got you now, you fart-lovin' fart-lovers. Hey, Saddam. You helped me get rid of Terrance and Phillip, and I appreciate that, but why are framed pictures of you going up all over Canada? ...No I don't need a rest!! I want to know what this is all aboot. I thought you were from Iraq. Hey, what the hell are you guys doing here? You're not supposed to be here, you're supposed to be in Iran looking for your kidnapped-- Ah, I mean, how are you guys today? Nothing, why? What? Aargh! I hate you more than ever, Terrance and Phillip! I absolutely abhor you both! I'm wishing cancer upon you. That's right. I'm trying to give you cancer with my mind.  What's so funny! Saddam, Terrance and Phillip are back in Canada! You promised me they'd be gone for good! That was your part of the bargain! This deal's getting worse all the time. Terrance, this is Scott. Just shut up and listen. You've unleashed a monster onto Canada! And only you can get rid of him, even though I hate you, and I wish you had cancer. ''You're'' a dick. ''You're'' a dick. ''You're'' a dick.  ''You're'' a dick. The two of you are the most annoying dicks in Canada. You give other Canadians a bad name. And if I had my hair- Sure. You son of a bitch! I'll get you if it's the last thin-- Sure. Goddammit! Sure. I mean, no! You listen to me! If you want to save Canada, you'll meet me at Karl's Kroff Dinner Restaurant in half an hour.   What are you idiots doing? Is that some kind of metaphor for a kind of search that can't be described? Listen. I have an inside scoop. There's an Iraqi dictator who is quietly and slowly taking over Canada. Well, what are you two gonna do aboat it? It's your fault that he's here! You brought the Iraqis back with you on your plane when you rescued your kidnapped daughter!  That's right. And now you must make amends. Tomorrow, Saddam will try to finalize his takeover of Canada, at the Roughriders-Roughriders football game. It will be your only shot at wiping them all out. Here, take this. It's a bomb. You must strap it to yourselves, go to the game, and sacrifice your lives to take out Saddam's minions. Well, you must do it for Canada. Yes, Terrance and Phillip. And when the dust is settled, Canada will be rid of both: the Iraqis and your immature fart humor.  Hey, What the hell happened? You were supposed to be blown up! Oh! That is so juvenile! Of course! '''I hate you, Terrance and Phillip!!!'''  
And so I told him, I said "Here. I'll sell you my pubes for only ten bucks." And this stupid asshole buys them!  Speak of the devil! What do ''you'' want? Uh uh, I don't take returns! You would actually tell your mom that you were stupid enough to pay for my pubes? Huh uh, I don't think so! Buyer beware, dude! Hehey, I said no! Now get your fat little butt out of here before I kick your head in!  You're not from the IRS! You glued my pubes onto your face! Alright alright. I'll trade you my pubes back for the money. How much did I charge? Uh, oh yeah. Ten dollars. You got change for a twenty? Oh. well... that's okay. Here. Just... give me the six dollars.  And then I'll... give you the twenty. Now, give me the pubes, and I'll give you back two dollars. Now, give me the twelve cents, and I'll give you the rest of your change back. And then give me the twenty, and I'll give you the pubes.  Okay, I'll buy the pubes back! Here! Sixteen dollars! Take it! I-I'll even throw in an extra five! Here! Give me back my pubes! No reason. Alright alright! The pube fair in Fort Collins. They're paying five bucks a hair for pubes! If I leave now, I can catch the last bus! Hehere, take your money! Oh, you can't do this to me! Nooo! Have you no heart?? You really went? What a 'tard. You do? Wow, you're not as stupid as I thought Your grandma? Oh.  Jeez, I-... I didn't realize that. Hey, kid... Hold on a second ah, ah, I'll get your money.  Here you go. But... just one thing before I give it to you: I just... well... I want you to beg for it. Just... get down on your knees and- beg me for the money. Do you want your grandma to live or not? No, no, get down on your knees. , and say "I beg you to give me back my money." Now say, "I'm a little piggy". Say it!  "Here's my snout." "Oink oink oink." Now dance, little piggy! Dance and oink for me! You mean this?  Now you can't bug me for your dumb money!  Uh huh. Oh, cool. Um, thanks for tellin' me.  Hello? What do you want? How do you know? Then why are you telling me? Oh. See ya.  Hey. Ooo, a chili carnival, huh? That sounds great. Wow, a pony ride. Neat. Gosh. Chili, rides, and ponies? What more could I want? What? How can I turn it down? Mom, Dad, that was my good friend Eric at the door? He told me that there's a starving pony at Denkins' ranch that's been abandoned.  Yeah, I feel really bad. But I don't know how I can help it, because I have a lot of homework to do. Wow, would you really? I feel so much better now. I'm proud of you, too, Mom. What's it look like? I'm making chili. Did you bring the goods? Awesome!  The little fat kid thinks he's gonna get revenge tomorrow. We'll see how he likes it when I tell him he just ate the pubes of every kid in town! Oh, I wouldn't miss this for anything. Just a second: don't you- wanna taste my chili first? Well I don't want it to get cold. I think I can win first prize.  Alright, I guess we should taste each other's chili, huh? Mmm. Ah, I don't know. Your chili is pretty good, Cartman, but I think mine is better. Try it. Eh, it's a special recipe. I'm glad you like it so much, because now that you're almost finished, I have some'in' to tell you. What?! My... mom and dad are... dead?     Jesus!  Noooo! 
Come on, Jared, lighten up! People don't hate you. 
 Hey! What the hell is going on?! Who damaged our beloved Canadian land?!  A-ha! Americans! I should've known! You think you're the police of the world! You think you own Canada! Well, you aren't welcome here! Get out now! This isn't over, you American scum! I swear to God: you'll rue this day!!   Power-hungry Americans! I'll fix you!  Ey! What are you doing?! What are you two doing helping these Americans?! Don't you know America thinks it owns Canada along with the rest of the world?! You're a dick! And by helping Americans, you're just as smelly as they are! Now I'm going to get you! Who the hell are you?! Ugh! This isn't over! Not by a long shot! I'll fix you. I'll fix all of you!!  Not so fast!  Prime Minister, these are the child's Canadian parents! Their Canadian blood pumps through his veins! Would you send him back to America with those world-hungry scum?! Haha, you lose, Americans! 
They were Mexicans. I was being ironic. 
Hey, don't make fun of my diabetes! Hey, that was supposed to be my power-up pack. 'At's enough, you guys, it's not cool. Lots of kids have diabetes, and you shouldn't be- Hey guys. Hey guys!  The girls all wanted to go watch 'at Bridon kid practice basketball. No, I think the girls just like that Bridon kid, no matter what he does. 
 She'll kiss anybody? Wow.  
You fart-loving tricksters! I'll take care of all of you! No! You all kept calling me a dick, and so then that turned me into a dick! And then I got radiation poisoning in Ottawa and now I'm a giant dick! Why would I take the princess of Canada? I'm also the biggest Canadian patriot of all of you! You know that I would never harm the royal family! What is wrong with you people?! It is perfectly obvious who took the princess! I might be a giant, but there is one threat to Canada bigger than me! The Native Canadians. There. You see that? God-damned Native Canadians! Think they run the world. Fart-loving Eskimos! I'm sure they've taken the princess! Just look at them! Loudmouthed self-centered assholes! Let's get 'em! Let's fuck them up!  Oh shit! This is stupid! I'm tellin' you you're making a mistake, kid! Well what are we doing, following this ice beaner?! We've been walking around for hours! Eskimos are good for nothing! I paid one to give me a blowjob once. All she did was rub her nose against my penis for forty-five seconds and asked me to pay her! Goddamned polar gooks! Oh, so now I'm a dick! It's the princess! There! Who took you, Princess?! Fart-loving tooth decay! I'll fix you!   You did it, kid! 
En garde!  Aaah God ow sorry...  Ah! I think my insulin's low. I need to eat. Yeah, we don't like it! Aw shit, I think I'm-I think I'm going to faint. I told you I have to eat every two hours. AAAH!  If I don't get pizza soon, I'm goin' to pass out. Ehhh... Stop! Stop please! I can't take any more!  Jeaaaaah! He hasn't even ordered the pizzas yet! 
I actually have plans this weekend. That is correct, yes, I do.  Would you guys care for a frozen butter pop? 
I can't do this anymore! I can't take it! Nobody ever pays attention to me! Nobody cares! I just want to end it all! Why not?! Everyone would be happier if I did! Everyone. I don't think they'd even notice! You're right, I guess I don't want to quit Twitter. Okay, thanks. Twitter would be better off without me! I'm quitting! What's the point!? Better to just end it all now! I'm gonna do it!  I'm gonna quit Twitter, I mean it this time! They all laugh at me. They won't be laughing when I do it! I'll show them! I swear to God I'm gonna do it this time. Why does it matter? People would be happier if I just did it! I-I talked to my dad. He said, "I don't have the guts to do it!". Well, if I'd quit Twitter, he'd be sorry! I don't know if I'll make it through the night! I just feel like I'm at the edge of a cliff, you know, and being chased by hate. And the only way out is to jump! I keep thinking about what the kids at school would do, when they find out I left all my social media. Like they would finally see all the damage they've done. 
Oh boy! What a great time that was. 
 What the fuck do we do? Yeth.  NO! What do real board gamers play?  My name is Scott Malkinson and I have diabetes.  I have terminal diabetes. Board games are the only thing that give me relief from the physical and mental anguish I experience every day. Neither did I.  
Say what?? Holy shit, guys! What am I gonna do?! About Sophie Gray! She's my boo! I love her! What am I supposed to say to her. I know! That's why she's perfect! But she has diabetes. You guys always rip on me for having diabetes. No! Not this time! You guys aren't ruining Scott Malkinson's life again! I'm taking control! Do you understand?!    Hi Sophie. Hoe's it going? I have something really important to tell you, Sophie. It can't wait. So, uh, you have diabetes, right?  So... what do you wanna do now?  So... what's your favorite food... that you can't eat? Mine's waffles. Oh... Oh... Ughuh, yeah, of course. I love The Mandalorian. Yeah, like, super dog shit. She's busy!  Oh my God. I would love that. Oh. Well, uh, the thing is, I, I mean uh...  She's busy, and she's watching Mandalorian at my house!  But Dad, there's this new girl in school, and she has... diabetes! Yeah. And guess what? She wants to come over to our house! So we HAVE to get Disney+! Dad, please! This is my life! But Dad, what's wrong with people watching what they wanna watch when they wanna watch it? Unbelievable!!  You gotta help me! With my baby girl!  She's everything to me, bro, but to impress her, I have to get Disney+. How can I get it without my parents' credit card?  You once had a girlfriend, Eric. You and Heidi were together a long time. You know how important this is. What are you talking about, Eric? It- I can handle diabetes. I can handle a relationship. Ah, hey. Uuhh, Eric Cartman told me you have access to streaming accounts. No, I'm Scott Malkinson. I go to your school. Haven't you ever heard the other kids say, "I'm Scott Malkinson. I have diabetes"? Uh I'm Scott Malkinson. No, I need a Disney+ account. I have two 16-needle boxes of insulin.  Oh God.  Hi, Sophie. Me too! Oh my God, I love you so much.  Uh, uhhh, here you go. I have lots of juices standing by. O-kay!  and clicks on it. I, uh I don't know.  It, ih-it's not... working.  Oh no, not Jimmy! Bae? Bae, come back!  And Scott. And Scott! Oh, what happened to "girls are just like diabetes"?! And Scott!  You assholes, stop talking to her! I am done having you all ruin my life! You hear me?! Done! You've taken my dignity for all these years, but you are not taking my girlfriend!  Eh. You're not? But Sophie, you're totally my type! Type I diabetes!  You seem to do alright. Yeah. You don't think I'm weird and gross? Wow. That's the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me. I'm sorry you missed your show, Sophie. I don't know what happened, but somehow I feel like it's my fault. 
You guys are dicks. I guess so. Huh?  Daaad?! I don't think so, Kommunity Kidz! You're not poisoning anybody with those vaccinations! I've learned the truth! And I won't let you hurt the teacher! You don't understand! I'm part of a militant group now! A secret cabal of patriot children!  Lil' Qties!  Move in on my position, Qties! For the past year, our feelings and our needs have been put dead last! Do you guys really trust anybody anymore? Now just put down the vaccines and walk away, Kommunity Kidz. We'll see who's stupid!   Wait, he's the Chosen One?
