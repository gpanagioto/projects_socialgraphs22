Here you go, Kyle... And here's yours, Stan... They're invitations to my birthday party this weekend. Thaat's right. <i>'Cause it's my birthday, my bu bubu birthday...</i> That's right. That's ri-''aayy''.  Oh, really? Gosh. Where could I have put Pip's invitation?? Let's see, Pip's invitation, Pip's invitation... Oh! I remember! I shoved it up my ass! Yeess, that's right. I wrote it out, put it in an envelope, sealed it, and then shoved it right up my ass, forever ruining any chance ''you'' had of coming to ''my birthday'' party! Sorry, Pip ol' chap! Here's yours, Wendy... and here's yours, Clyde... No, my birthday isn't until Saturday. Eeeeeeh! Hey, new kid. Do you want an invitation to my birthday party? Psych! I wasn't gonna ''give'' you an invitation, hehehehehehe! Hey, who cut your hair? Stevie Wonder? Byah. Oof!  Hey! I had a poofy pie in that desk! Eheh.  <i>You got in trouble, you got in trouble.</i> Right. That's what your supposed to get for my birthday. Look, it's very simple guys. Green Mega Man goes with Red Mega Man and Yellow Mega Man to make the Ultra Mega Mega Man. You have to have all three or it doesn't work, see? ''Oooh''. So maybe you don't want to have any of my mom's cake, pie, and ice cream, then. Now. As you can see, Kenny, ''you'' are to get me ''Yellow'' Mega Man. That's because Yellow Mega Man is the cheapest one, and I know how poor your family is. Yeah. You can't sit with us, weirdo! Yich. Anyway Kenny, Yellow Man is only $8.95, so maybe your mom can put it on layaway and make payments for a year or two. Eeyy! Eeyy! Uh-turn him back you butt-hole, he has to buy me the Yellow Mega Man! Now, as you can see, the Red Mega Man uses thee... Mega Cycle, which is what Clyde will be getting me for my birthday. Wendy, ''you'' were supposed to get me the Mega Power Chopper, illustrated... here, but, I'm changing your present to the Yellow Mega Man, since Kenny has been turned into a... duck-billed platypus. That means that the Mega Man beach house, illustrated... heuh, will be a gift given by two people at once, 'cause it costs more money... Hey, wait a minute. Saturday is my birthday party. They can't have the fight on Saturday! Cartman's birthday! You guys, my mom is getting a Ferris wheel. Who the hell decided the fight had to be on Saturday, huh?! This whole thing is a plot against me, isn't it?! Don't mind him, Jesus, he's Jewish.  Oh, here comes the unholy butt-hole now. Ey! Thanks a lot for burning everything down, you little bitch!  Oh, excuse me new kid. I didn't mean to fart on you, I didn't have a choice! You guys, shouldn't you be out shopping for my birthday presents? Welcome, Clyde. Please put your present on the table to your left. Welcome, Bebe, presents go to your left. Welcome, Chef. Hey! What the hell do you think ''you're'' doing here? Yeah. Come on in and join the party.  Oooh I wonder what Stan got me for my birthday present? Oh look, a Blue Mega Maaan. Thank you, Stan, you may now eat pie and cake and ice cream now.  You son of a bitch!  You were supposed to get me the red Mega Man, eh! Now I can't make the Ultra Mega Mega Man, you dirty cheap-ass piece of crap!  I hate you! I want you to die! Die!! Aah! Aaaaaggghhhhh!! That's it! Party is over! Everybody go home! Get the hell out, I said! The party's over! Get out goddammt!! Take your stupid Ants In The Pants with you! Eh... n-yeh. No... more... pie... eheh... seriously.
