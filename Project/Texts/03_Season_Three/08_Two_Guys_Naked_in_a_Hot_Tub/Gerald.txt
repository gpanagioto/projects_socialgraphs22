Wow, neat! Yeah. Well, screw you guys!  Yeah, I know what you mean. Well, that's what being young is all about. Once you have a family and a career, your experimenting days are over. But tonight is the exception; that's why I'm gonna smoke this cigar.  What haven't you tried that you've always wanted to try? Yeah! ...Was that your leg? Yeah. She sure does. I wouldn't mind takin' that home. I wish. That's the one thing I've always thought of experimenting with. A threesome. Huh, well, two girls, of course! I mean ...with another guy, you know, that'd be...  You haven't? Well, I never really wanted to experiment with anything too crazy. You know... maybe just... I don't know... masturbate in front of another guy. NO, no, uh I don't think so. Sure is.   So uh. Well. That was certainly... interesting. Uh, you don't regret doing it now, do you? Thuh that's right. It's just harmless experimenting. Hey.  Nothing changes between us, right? I mean, we're still friends.  Can I come with you?  Randy, you're making me feel unimportant. Talk. Talk, damn you. So, so now we can't be friends? We said we'd never tell anybody? Oh, uh I didn't realize that.  Well, uh uh a few people, yeah. You didn't say ''not'' to tell anyone. Listen to you. You're yelling at me; you've never yelled at me before. Hey, Randy, what's up? Huh? Wulluh uh I just felt like talkin' to you. You're having regrets, aren't you? Hey. Talk to me. I thought we agreed what happened in the hot tub wouldn't change our relationship. Hey, Mr. Withdrawn, ''you'' might not need to talk about it, but ''I'' sure do. Having a good time? I'm not gonna let you change on me, Randy. Just because we shared an intimate moment in the hot tub, I won't let it change our friend-  Honey? Everybody doesn't know. And why are you so ashamed of me? I just want to know it meant something to you. So we're friends again?
