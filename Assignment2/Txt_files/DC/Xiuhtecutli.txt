'''The Cadre''' is a [[DC Comics]] <!--Do not add "fictional" as it is tautological; supervillains (and characters in general) are by definition implied to be fictionalized to some extent.-->[[supervillain]] group, except for members of the Cadre of the Immortal, most of whom were redeemed and became heroes by story's end.

==Publication history==
The Cadre first appeared in ''[[Justice League of America]]'' #235 (February 1985) and were created by [[Gerry Conway]] and [[Chuck Patton]].<ref name="dc-ency">{{Citation | last = Wallace | first = Dan | contribution = Cadre | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | pages = 64 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-7566-4119-1 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref>

==Fictional team history==
===Overmaster's Cadre===
A cosmic alien villain known as the Overmaster began to test humanity's fitness to inhabit Earth.<ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |page=256}}</ref> He summoned a bunch of villains to him and gave them superpowers, and the villains became the Cadre. The Cadre has fought the [[Justice League]] on different occasions and has been through many incarnations of their group. Several members have died and new ones were recruited.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

The original [[Justice League]] defeated the Cadre, after which the Overmaster vanished. Years later, he returned, acting through heralds such as the [[Aryan Brigade]], the New [[Extremists (comics)|Extremists]], and the Cadre of the Immortal.

===Cadre of the Immortal===
There was also another version of the Cadre called the Cadre of the Immortal; this version was made up of international [[metahuman]]s deluded by an agent of the Overmaster that claimed to be [[Prester John]], the Immortal. He then announced his intention to destroy the Earth in one week, erasing [[Central City (DC Comics)|Central City]] from the planet and stopping all deaths and births across the globe as proof of his power. The Justice League invaded the Overmaster’s spacecraft and used its technology to reverse all effects of the Overmaster’s activities. The Mahayogi was killed while freeing JLI member [[Maya (comics)|Maya]] from mind control. After the truth was revealed Seneca and Osiris joined the JLI in their battle against the Overmaster, but have not been seen in the DCU since.

Overmaster was accidentally killed by Will Everett III, the second [[Amazing Man (DC Comics)#Will Everett III|Amazing Man]], after the Justice League member [[Ice (comics)|Ice]] had been killed by the villain. Following this event, the League moved into the Refuge, Overmaster’s space station, making it their new headquarters.

===Second Cadre===
Another version of the Cadre was formed with various members of minor DC villain groups such as the [[Extremists (comics)|Extremists]].<ref name="dc-extr">{{Citation | last = Jimenez | first = Phil | author-link = Phil Jimenez | contribution = Extremists, The | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | pages = 117 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-7566-4119-1 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref>
