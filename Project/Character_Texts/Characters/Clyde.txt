Yes. Oh. Dow! 
Aw, my dog Rex follows me to football practice all the time. Oh my God! What is he doing to my dog?! Make him stop! 
What's it look like? 
Yeah, what's the big idea having your mom call all our moms last night? Not watch ''Terrance & Phillip'' ever? 
Owww, you bit my arm! Brainnns. Ahh. 
Aaaah! Aaaah! Me too. 
I bet I can spit the most on him. 
Whoa. Is that Wendy Testaburger? 
Yes, please, Eric. Why are you so cool? Hooray for Eric! I think you're a big fat piece of crap. Naw, you're not fat. 
Ow! Ahow-ow-ooooowww! I heard the school nurse is hideously deformed. Denver? 
What if we don't know anybody who was in Vietnam? Oh. 
I hope my dad doesn't sing. 
 I wanna go again. I wanna go again! Yes. Yes, please! 
Bitchin'. 
Hey, what's going on? Really? Cool.  It's funny, 'cause Tweek and Craig both went home about fifteen minutes ago. I guess they don't wanna fight. Uh, how long do you expect the fight to last? Wow. Tweek and Craig really hate each other, huh? This should be a good fight. Mr. Adler. Mr. Adler! Tommy stuck his face in the belt sander   What's that? What? She die or something? Oh boy! Here we go!  All that build-up for nothing.  Programs, get your programs here. Programs. 
Hababah... Wow! I wanna sue somebody!   Um... 
 We've got to get that picture to your mom so that she will come home and save us. 
Yeah. Those girls don't realize what good sledders Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are. Huh? I'm not fat.  Hey, I'm ''not fat'', you guys. I'm just kind of big-boned. So I don't get to be on the team now?  Right here. For the last time, I'm not fat, so stop calling me fat, God-damnit!  Oh, thank you! Thank you for coming back!  Thank you so much. Thank you. 
Right.  
Yeah. If we died right now, we'd have unclean souls and we'd burn in hell.  ...We've gotta get to that church before ''we'' die. 
Like what?  Hey, Timmy might need some help pulling his pants down. 
Oh, no! Oh, now what? Well, we can add music numbers, but how do we make the Helen Keller story more Thanksgivingy? Tonight we present the story of a courageous girl and her fight against depression Oppression. Our play begins in a simpler time.  Oh.  That's the prettiest turkey I ever saw. Yeah, and it's from Broadway. We're never gonna outdo them now!  
I've got three. 
Who's Scott Tenorman? 
Ah, excuse me? My daddy is a geologist and he says there actually isn't any concrete evidence of global warming. Thank you.  
Oh.  Yeah! But I think it's broke down. The cars aren't moving. 
There, you see? The girls have built some kind of stronghold to keep us out.  
You mean they both have butts instead of heads? Yeah, we gotta remember to kick his ass tomorrow.  
Wwooww. 
 ...What if we don't want to be your friend?  This whole thing is stupid! You don't pick people you wanna be with by making it into a game! 
Hey, Tolkien. You know, I never really noticed before, but that girl Bebe is... kinda cool. That is an awesome answer! Wow, hella fun. That's awesome. It's weird how we never noticed before.  You try it, Bebe. Yeah.  Here, it's like if you put your thumb on this side-  Yeah, just let me show her real quick how to put the thumb and-   My paper is called, "Why Bebe is the coolest person, ever".  Hoh!  Chase his tail? That must be so funny!  Hey, have any of you dumb girls seen Bebe anywhere? We're trying to get Bebe to run for class president. What? Yeah! Yeah!  Yeah. Screw boobs! They're stupid! Let's never let boobs come between us again! Look at those ridiculous things! 
What do you guys want? Oh. Okay, hang on a second.  What troubles you? So? I have three copies. And the DVD with twelve hours of extra footage. Very well, I shall call the council together. Meet me in the Woods of Gathering behind Talangar the Black's house. And don't let my mom see you, 'cause I'll get in trouble. Faragon, asshole!  And so that is the situation. The video may or may not have evil power. Kyle, would you bring it up here, please?  Look, until we see this tape's power for ourselves, we cannot risk giving it to anybody. That is true. Only a Paladin with a high constitution should watch the tape. Therefore, I think it is a job for you, Talangar the Black. What vice did you see on the videotape, Talangar? Is it the work of Sauron's magic?  One thing for sure, this tape cannot be trusted with anybody. It must be returned to the video store from whence it came. It is too far and too dangerous to go alone. Take with you the wizard . Very well. You shall be the Fellowship of ''The Lord of the Rings''. Good luck. I have to go home now before I get in trouble. 
I'm not gonna touch it. ''You'' throw it away. Nobody wants to touch it. And the commercial where the two kids have pot and the one kids shoots the other. Harmless? 
Yeah. They say it's gonna take three weeks to get it all down. 
Oh my God, where is my homework?! I am freaking out!  
Yeah, go kick his ass. 
Let me see. From the nice guy at the county fair. Then fight us! Butters! Butters! 
But we like being the Cows!  What do you guys want? I haven't decided yet.   I'm still not totally sure. That we can go back to being the South Park Cows!  
Yeah, and it was called ''Man from Atlantis'', and he had like, webbed fingers...  
 
 
I don't know, that looks pretty high up. 
What happens to the lion cubs? Yeah yeah, come on!  
Did it hurt? 
Like that motorcycle kid in ''Bad News Bears.'' 
I never realized ignoring him was an option. Yeah Eric, we're gonna stop ignoring you now.  
It's occupied.  
I don't know. I got this emergency letter from Cartman that said to meet in his basement.   NOW ''DAMN'' YOU, LET HIM ''SPEAK''! Where did they get that thing?  It's all set. Once we have the device, it can be housed in here safely until we know what we're dealing with. Nice. You're gonna be fine. Good luck, man.  Then, he's already dead. How come you get to use it first? Ask if the Broncos are gonna win on Sunday. Yeah. Forget about the girls. What about if the CIA or, or the Russians know we have this? They'll come after us for sure. 
 I am.  You're not supposed to be in the cafeteria. Right. And you're a ginger.  Sorry. If we let one ginger kid in here, then the others are gonna start coming.  
...A whale. Talked to you. Well we can't keep the whale out here anymore, people are gonna see it! Whales are mammals; they don't need water to breathe, dumb-ass. Mexico has a space program? We're busted.  Oh Jesus, they're here! Yeah, me too.  
Something's wrong with Chef. He's saying some really weird stuff. I think... I think he wants to have sex with me. I gotta- I gotta go.  
Kyle, the person leaving. Kyle's not here. Cartman didn't invite him. Hey! Hey, Stan! You're not gonna believe it! You've gotta come see! It's a miracle! 
Are you guys dumb? We can't beat him, even with all of us. It's a waste of time. I've got better things to do.  I'm just gonna stop playing. No. All right all right, I'll do it! 
Whoa... I don't know.  
 Dude. 
What? Oh my God. Oh Christ no! Please, ya-you don't understand. The other kids are gonna make fun of me forever! Yes they are! This is so... embarrassing. I have... I have AIDS.   But why me, doctor? ''Why me?!'' How did I get this?! ...Sick! Well I guess we're never gonna know. There's no way to tell. Ye-you guys, we'd better go. Recess is almost over. What? What are you gonna do to him?  I... nothing. Mrs. Garrison, one of your students is about to be attacked at the park by all the other students. Please just hurry to the park! You have to stop them!  You guys, maybe we should just... wait a few more minutes? Wait, wait! What? Wait a-wait a minute, what? 
No, I got it done.  
He won't make it. 
This is Hawk Eyes. We've set up the net and we're standing by.  Hey, he's here.  
If it's just looks then I think I'm safe. All right, hurry! Get it up there! Let's see it! What number am I on? Me?   Oh yeah, hey, whassup? What's goin' on? Nice. Hey, what's goin' on? Hey. What's goin' on?    Butters, that's not cool, man.  Naw, Rebecca's just a friend. I wanna be with you now. Sure, yeah, I'll buy you some shoes too. 
...Oh... 
Why are they doing this?!  What do we do? 
 She sure seems confident. You should probably go easy on her, dude. You don't wanna put her in the hospital or anything. I totally can't see the fight, dude. I have detention after school. And so, we must all recycle. Every day. Recycling is important, and it will save our planet, Earth. The End.  Oh boy here we go! 
You know, the sequel to ''High School Musical 1'' and ''2''. Who's the male lead? 
Yeah, so do I. I don't know, it's just a cool costume. 
Sure was better when our parents were buyin' us stuff. 
They're gonna finally reveal who Phillip farted on to get out of jail. I threw up on my way home. 
Hey. Yes.  Yes.   He's the most awesome kid in school! 
Somalia? Where's that? Well, there's really not that many of us. We figured we should let him join. And your mom is okay with that? Yeah maybe we should think about this. This is Somalia? You said there was gonna be crystal clear lagoons and treasure and plunderrrr!  No it's not! You made me run away to be a pirate and there's not even any treasure!  Hard to port! I hate it here and I wanna go home!!  
You guys, we got it!  We got it. Sally Darson is selling kisses for five dollars. She hangs out behind the temp building during afternoon recess. She'll kiss any boy that pays her.  So then when she sticks her tongue out you just kind of lick it with your tongue. Wow wee.  
Hey, here he comes! 
 Alright. 
We're just having a hard time finding him. We must have just missed him. He was playing at Cherry Creek mall and then Flat Irons mall. Now we don't know where to go because Slash is playing the Pavilion in Colorado Springs in the Gigadome in Moscow later this afternoon. We don't know. He's everywhere. But we have a big deal with EA Sports that depends on it. Dad, is Slash real or make-believe? Slash isn't real. He's made up and people dress like him and pretend to be him to their kids.  Here, look for yourself.  One of our parents. One of our parents! 
 I just can't believe how yummy these are. 
I was enthralled with the dialog exchange. 
 
Oh grow up. 
A toilet? Okay mom, just not in front of my friends okay? Look, could you guys just not say anything about this in school, please? Mom? Why? Mom, I'm in class.  But she's not gonna die, is she? Mom, I'm sorry. Mom? So that's it? Mom? That's not what I said. 
 
You wanna know who I hate?! I hate that kid Butters! He's a dork! You didn't hear?! Now that America knows Butters was actually a violent psychopath, they're saying you made a bull-crap bullying video! 
What's she look like? 
I can't even remember if we're supposed to hug the fullback or compliment him. I'm so confused. Well, we might as well call up Lakewood and tell 'em we forfeit.   We don't have a coach, Kyle. Yeah. We need more of your mojo, Butters. 
Lying jerk!  There's a guy selling them downtown. But they're not made from recycled plastic. Yes you do.  
What's Shitter? How many people are ''on'' Shitter? 
The police found hours and hours of murder porn on the Hagens' DVR. What more proof do we need?! Why did we agree to that stupid app?! 
Which nobody can afford.  How about we ask those kids who play Star Trek? Just find out who they're loyal to. The Sony people might not be our biggest problem. Twitter says they're introducing a new Elmo doll this Christmas. 
Apparently, he stopped Microsoft from blockading the shipment of PS4s to the mall. Looks like he's all over the place winning the console wars for Sony. Nobody saw that coming. The mall isn't open yet. They're waiting for George R. R. Martin to come cut the ribbon. 
At least she didn't try to sit on him.  Hey, Tolkien. Tolkien, check out my girlfriend.  Yeah, we just started dating seriously.  You wanna meet my new girlfriend, Tweek? Yeah, I know.  Oh, thanks, guys.  It's okay, babe. Girls who don't have what you have are always going to put you down.  Uh, my bitch is still the hottest, you guys. 
I'm glad the food is good. Lorde sucks. 
Hey Cartman. Heard you're transgender.  Awe, come on, lay off him guys. No, no, just he is.  
What are you doing, Butters? 
Ugh, so weird! Yeah, I mean, it's fine you wanna go preach about Caitlyn Jenner, but you can't just make blanket statements about letting anyone do whatever they want. 
You guys should come and check it out. It's pretty cool, dude. People are scared of us. Intruders!  What? 
That's a vagina? 
You didn't hear?  What do you think they're talking about? Then let's end it. Cartman is the cause of all our problems. Always. We all know what has to be done.  It's not like we haven't talked about it before - fantasized about how we'd do it. I'm sure you will. The girls are gonna do something drastic to us. We have to take matters into our own hands. I can't listen to this! 
The cops? For what? 
Nowhere. 
Kick her ass, Butters. She called you stupid. Oh yeah? You guys fucked up all the frosting! 
We got Google Home at my house. Heidi abuses you? 
Bzzz oh boy, I get my own origin movie, bzzz? I think that's Mark Zuckerberg. Oh Jesus, here we go again. 
 He's not making it up. It's my birthday party. 
Dude, what are you talking about?! I don't care, I don't want a priest at my fucking birthday party! Kyle, will you do something please?! All right, that does it!  Worst birthday ever!  
As soon as the school bell rings, we find the nearest scooters and begin trick or treating in Butters' neighborhood here. Then at 3 p.m. we-  Cover it! Cover it!  Oh. Hey Kenny. You wanna trick or treat with us? What about Stan and Kyle and those guys? Yeah, look, don't tell anybody, but, um... we're gonna trick or treat on e-scooters this year. We're seriously gonna rake in the candy. Problem is, e-scooters work with a phone and pretty sure  you don't h-have one Dude, it's trick or treat. It's not something we're just willing to mess around with, okay?  Fine by us. So what are you gonna be for Halloween? Does anyone have a signal? 
Then how do they make baby bugbears?   Do something, Eric! Look, maybe we just gotta play harder stuff, you know? Stuff the girls can't keep up with. See what? Hey, those girls are playing “Crisis Protocol”. That’s not even out yet. 
 Hey, you're the new girl, right? ...Clyde Donovan. 
Good morning. 
You're not hurting our teacher again! Hey, Cartman!  Dude, they're reopening Casa Bonita this weekend. Do you wanna come with us? 
My dad says that he listened to Matt Damon and lost all his money. 
Yeah, I knew that. 
A drill?
