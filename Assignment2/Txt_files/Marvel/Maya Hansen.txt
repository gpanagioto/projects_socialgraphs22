Following the events of the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' storyline, Maya Hansen disappeared from the series and was not seen again until the relaunch of the ''Iron Man'' series during the ''[[Marvel NOW!]]'' event. It was revealed that she was kidnapped by [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] to recreate the Extremis serum for them and succeeded. Though she was killed while trying to escape, she accomplishes her failsafe plan by sending a prerecorded message she made to Tony to warn him that the Extremis virus is on the loose again.<ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 5 #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Maya Hansen has genius-level intellect. She was a brilliant scientist who designed Extremis, a virus that could rewrite humans' genetic code and provide enhancements to the body. She earned at least three [[Ph.D.]]s, one in [[botany]].<ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 4 #10</ref>

According to [[Mandarin (character)|The Mandarin]], Maya's genetic sequence would have allowed her to survive being exposed to Extremis.<ref>''The Invincible Iron Man'' #25</ref>

===Film===
* Maya Hansen appears in the 2013 film ''[[Iron Man 3]]'', where she is portrayed by actress [[Rebecca Hall]]. In the film, Maya is a scientist and one of [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]]'s one-night stands; in a flashback to 1999, she reveals to him the prototype of the virus known as Extremis and is upset when he leaves her after their night together and forgoes aiding her research. Maya reunites with Tony during the film to warn him about the Mandarin and is saved by [[Pepper Potts]] from the destruction of his mansion. She is later revealed to be working with [[Aldrich Killian]] to improve on Extremis and use the Mandarin to cover up the deaths of their test subjects. To convince Tony to help perfect the virus, Maya tricks Pepper while in hiding and tells Killian where to find them, resulting in Pepper being taken captive. Later however, she has a change of heart when confronted by Tony and realizing the extent of Killian's agenda. Maya then tries to back out of Killian's plan by holding a vial of potent Extremis to her neck and threatening to kill them all in the resulting explosion unless he frees Tony and Pepper. Instead, Killian decides she is no longer necessary to his plans and shoots her himself. An extended scene of this shows Maya sending her files on Extremis to Tony as she is dying from her gunshot wound in order to help him stop Killian.
