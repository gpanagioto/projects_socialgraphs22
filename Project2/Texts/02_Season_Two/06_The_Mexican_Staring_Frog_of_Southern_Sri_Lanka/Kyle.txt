Mr. Garrison, were you in Vietnam? Hey, yeah! He and Ned do that stupid TV show. Cartman! What kind of stupid-ass question is that?! Of course it was fun! Are there any questions? Yes, Mr. Garrison? F-minus? Can he do that? How do you know? You weren't even there. Yeah, dude, your Uncle Jimbo sucks ass!  We've got to get him back, dude. Well, he screwed us by makin' something up; I say we do the same thing. Did you guys ever see that one ''Brady Bunch'' where the guy...  Dude, I can't believe they fell for it! Come on! We've gotta make another one!  Der, Cartman! Just do it again, Cartman, and don't make it talk!  'Cause old ladies are fat and you are, too! Dude, they're gonna look so stupid. Look! Yeah, we made the whole thing up. It was all just a really, really funny joke!  Aw, come on. Ned's faking it. That frog was just a piece of ''plastic!'' Who are you? You bastards! Yeah! Then she told us to throw a chair at Ned! Yeah. And we're sorry for turning Ned into a vegetable. Wait a sec. Where ''is'' your producer?
