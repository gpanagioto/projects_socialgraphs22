 Could we speak with you please? Ooookay students, um, obviously we've had a little emergency with your teacher, so uh, while we deal with this, we need one of you to lead the class and review for tomorrow's quiz. Uhh, who, who else would like to be teacher for the day? Anybody else?  Any other volunteers, perhaps? All right, all right, fine. Eric, you lead the class. Now, just lead a review over whatever Mr. Garrison's been teaching you, and I'll be back to check on you shortly.  Eric, we've called you in to commend you for your role as student teacher.  After leading your class through review, your schoolmates scored higher than they ever had on their tests. Whatever you did really worked on them. These gentlemen from the Denver County School Board have something they want to ask you. Students and faculty, please put your hands together and help me in welcoming back, ''Mister'' Garrison.
