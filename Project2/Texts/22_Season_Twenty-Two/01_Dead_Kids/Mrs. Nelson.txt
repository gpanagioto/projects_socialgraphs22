I want you all to take a close look at your math exams, children. Some of you did very well, but many of you did not.    And what about the four's? Tolkien? Ah, I can't hear you, Eric. And now we divide, right?! Craig, how about you?! What are we dividing?! The four by the six?! Or the six by the four?! Now we're gonna retake the exam on Friday. Now I'm giving you an opportunity to do better. I hope you take advantage of it. Eric, that's enough! ["Shooter is down, shooter is down"] Now let's move on to the next equation. The quiz is multiple-choice, but be sure to show all your work. You'll have 20 minutes to complete your answers. All right, your time starts... now.
