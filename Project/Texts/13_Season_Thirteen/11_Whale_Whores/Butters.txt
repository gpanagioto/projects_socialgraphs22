Hey Stan! I heard you were looking for people who care about the Japanese slaughterin' whales. Nononono, I got stuff to do. But I wanted to tell you there's these fellers on TV. They go out in the ocean an' try to stop the Japanese wherever they are. I watch their show all the time. And, they take volunteers.
