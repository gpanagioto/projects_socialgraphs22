Boys I want to thank you for coming down to my office on such short notice.  No. Boys, I'm a lawyer. Your friend Kenny has passed away and I've called you here to read his will.  "In the highly likely event of my death, I, Kenny McCormick, wish to leave all my belongings to my good friends, Stan and Kyle. Dudes, you were the friends a guy could have." To Eric Cartman: "Eric, I never really liked you. But then, nobody does. You have no ability to feel, and you are going to die alone and miserable. It is only because I feel so sorry for you that I leave you my Sony PSP." There is one more thing I would like to ask you all, as my friends. If I should ever be in a vegetative state and kept alive on life-support, please,...  I don't know. I lost the last page.  It's right here, along with Kenny's other belongings. They're all yours.
