The job is to read what is written on the paper, Eric, not to embellish the way you do. No, it's just that the announcements need to be quick so the students can get on with their work. All we ask is you keep it shorter. Eric, we've been informed by a concerned student that you are writing naughty books about one of the girls here at the school.  Eric, I've had enough! You cannot and you will not sell your books on school grounds! Do I make myself clear?!
