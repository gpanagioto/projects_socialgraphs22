Well uh, uh, oh... Right now there's a cheese and sausage cart in the plaza. And I would uh, I'd hate to have to move it off to the side for a while. What? No. I mean, you're just not as good as sausage and cheese. Wow. That was your best?  What? Oh. It's you. I don't like you. Oh. What? Hey. This video is dumb. Alright alright. What? Well, I guess I can move the sausage and cheese cart off to one side.  For a little while. Only for twenty minutes, though. Oh. Okay.  Wow. What?  Hey. Uh, are you gonna do that thing or what? Well hurry up. I can't keep the sausage and cheese cart off this spot much longer.   Alright, kids, uh, that does it. You're gonna have to move and make way for the sausage and cheese cart. Sorry. Get out!  Who? Well. Okay, I guess. But hurry up. Alright, that's it, kids. Get out!
