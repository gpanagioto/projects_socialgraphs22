 Wow, that sounds great. I always wanted to try my dancing somewhere else. Why not? Hey, we should get that kid that was state champion in tap dancing. I think his name was...  Leopold... Stotch or something? A tragedy? Yeah, you didn't tell us that we might get served.  Stan. Stan, we have a big problem! It's Jeffy. He sprained his ankle. He was practicing the six-eight count and slipped on the floor.
