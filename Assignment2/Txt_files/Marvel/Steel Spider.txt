==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===
[[Image:Amazing Spider-Man 263.GIF|left|180px|thumb|Ollie Osnick as Spider-Kid in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #263. Art by [[Ron Frenz]].]]
Ollie Osnick is an overweight, gifted teenager who idolized [[Doctor Octopus]]. Using his genius, Ollie designs his own mechanical tentacles and calls himself '''Kid Ock'''. He influences a group of kids to dress up as super-villains, but they soon ran out on him. Ollie eventually runs away from home and breaks into a toy store.<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #72. Marvel Comics.</ref>

There, he renders an elderly guard unconscious, although Ollie believes he has killed him. When [[Spider-Man]] arrives on the scene, he believes that it was actually Dr. Octopus at work, so he chases Ollie. Spider-Man realizes in time that it was not Ock he was facing. When Spider-Man and Ollie fall into a water tank, Spider-Man easily rips apart a tentacle, something that he was never able to do with Ock. Dragging Ollie to the surface, he learns it was actually Ollie he was chasing. By then the guard regains consciousness, and Spider-Man returns Ollie home safely.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #262. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Impressed with Spider-Man, Ollie modifies his tentacles into spider-legs and dons a Spider-Man [[Halloween]] costume, calling himself the '''Spider-Kid'''. Ollie's heroic activities often resulted in him having to be saved by Spider-Man.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #263. Marvel Comics.</ref> He was involved (along with [[Frog-Man]] and the [[Toad (Marvel Comics)|Toad]]) in a short-lived super-hero team called The Misfits. Ollie was eventually convinced to hang up his costume and became a normal child.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #266. Marvel Comics.</ref>

However in his college years, Ollie had radically changed. He had devoted himself to exercise and became very athletic. Ollie still fantasized about being a hero, continuing to invent new weapons and modify his spider-legs. When his girlfriend was paralyzed by [[Footpad|mugger]]s, Ollie seeks revenge and creates the identity of "Steel Spider", donning a dark blue costume, and equipping himself with all of these new weapons (including gauntlets containing a grappling hook launcher and pepper spray blasters). Steel Spider locates and brutalizes his girlfriend's attackers. He removes his costume, realizing that he never wanted to be a vigilante and would rather build a life with the girl he loves.<ref>''Spider-Man Unlimited'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When [[Onslaught (Marvel Comics)|Onslaught]] attacks [[New York City]], he is mentioned to be one of the heroes helping against the invading [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinels]], working with [[Darkhawk]] and the [[New Warriors]] to retake the [[Brooklyn Bridge]].<ref>''Green Goblin'' #12. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Equipped with a new set of arms, Ollie Osnick now displays a more rebellious attitude towards the [[Superhero Registration Act]] following the "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]" storyline. As an unregistered superhero, Ollie becomes a target for the government's [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] team. Mention of his name also causes Thunderbolts director [[Norman Osborn]] to collapse into fits of laughter, as it reminds him of Spider-Man.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #112. DC Comics.</ref> After having beaten several drunken misfits, Ollie becomes afraid of the government sponsored Thunderbolts.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #113. DC Comics.</ref>

Ollie fights the Thunderbolts,<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #114. DC Comics.</ref> and is joined in his battle by [[American Eagle (Marvel Comics)|American Eagle]] and [[Sepulchre (comics)|Sepulchre]]. After successfully defeating [[Mac Gargan|Venom]], [[Radioactive Man (comics)|Radioactive Man]] and [[Fenris (comics)|Swordsman]], he uses the gadgetry in his metal limbs to square up against Radioactive Man, [[Songbird (comics)|Songbird]], Venom, and [[Robbie Baldwin|Penance]], commenting that having allies "almost makes this a fair fight. I bet they weren't expecting that". As the fight continues, Ollie seems to be holding his own until Venom unexpectedly bites off and eats Ollie's left arm which later got Venom reprimanded by Osborn.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #115, DC Comics.</ref> Ollie is later shown being incarcerated in Prison 42 in the [[Negative Zone]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #116. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Heroic Age (comics)|Heroic Age]]" storyline following the defeat of Norman Osborn at the [[Siege (comics)|Siege of Asgard]], Captain America researched Steel Spider and placed his incarceration under reconsideration.<ref>''Heroic Age: Heroes'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] continuity, Ollie Osnick never quits being Steel Spider and is even a member of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. He modifies his costume into a powerful exoskeleton and becomes a highly respected superhero. However, when his personal life fails and his wife leaves him, Steel Spider goes looking for criminals to take out his frustrations, but the crooks he finds are so afraid of him they surrender without a fight. Steel Spider has a tantrum, until he sees that he is being watched by [[Spider-Girl (Mayday Parker)|Spider-Girl]] and [[American Dream (comics)|American Dream]]. They tell him how much of an inspiration he had been to them, and he helps them defeat a terrorist cell called the [[Sons of the Serpent]]. After this, he sets about rebuilding his shattered personal life.<ref>''Spider-Girl'' #32. Marvel Comics.</ref>
