Hi, Stan. Kyle, doesn't Bebe look pretty today? She does. She looks very pretty. Stan, can I talk to you for a second? Stan, wouldn't it be fun if we fixed Kyle up with Bebe? If Bebe and Kyle were a couple, then we can invite them over to your clubhouse for dinner and play parlor games and have meaningful conversations and sip cognac by the fireplace. Yeah, Stan. You don't?? I thought all guys had clubhouses. Stan, you have to build a clubhouse! Then all four of us can sit in it and play Truth or Dare! I think it did, Bebe. If all goes as planned, Kyle will be your new boyfriend. Is the clubhouse ready? Hi, guys. How's the clubhouse coming? Well, hurry! We wanna play Truth or Dare!  Hi, guys. I will. Kyle? Truth or Dare?  How about we give him Bebe?  Okay. Kiss Bebe on the lips! What's the matter, Kyle? Your turn, Bebe. Bye, Stan. Hopefully we can play Truth or Dare tomorrow. Wow, that sucks!
