 Hey Eric! I'm not suspended no more.  I think someone's in there. That's Cartman's new transgender bathroom. He's not a woman, he's not a man, he is something that you'll never understand. But he would die for me.  Holy moly! [Wendy pulls out a key and goes into the Other bathroom]  Hey! Everything okay, Stan? Just hold it. That's what I do now.  Yeah, what's the big idea harassing Erica, Stan?! Yeah! Stan's a big old fat cissy! Hey! Where do you think you're going?! Oh no you don't! You've gotta use the cissy bathroom!
