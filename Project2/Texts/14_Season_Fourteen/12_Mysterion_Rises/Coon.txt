Come on, people! Some of us need to get to New Orleans NOW!  Yes yes, I am the Coon. Ya have? Actually, I'm no longer with Coon and Friends. I work on my own now. Yes, of course.  This fight would not be the last the Coon fought. Next stop: New Orleans! Cthulhu! Cthulhu, dude! Over here!  Goddammit, why don't dark lords fuckin' listen?!  What should I do?  Convincing a giant creature from another dimension to do what you want is no easy task. After days of killing and conquering, Cthulhu is at rest. Now is my chance to make a move. Perhaps last time I was too forceful with the dark god. Too demanding. To get what it wants, sometimes a coon must be on the attack and vicious.  Ladies and Gentlemen, today we are pleased to announce the successful merger of Cthulhu, and the Coon. Cthulhu's track record for complete dominance and interdimensionary rule is without question. And now, coupled with the legitimacy and instantly recognizable brand name of The Coon, we intend to bring change and fight injustice. As the all-new Coon and Friends. And anybody else using that name for their benefit is breaking the law! Oh, what's that? There is another group using our trademarked name? Well, I guess we have a right to banish them to a dark oblivion, don't we?! Yeeheah! Yeah, fuck all o'you! Lick my balls! <poem><i>Now begins a new adventure for... MEEEE!</i></poem> <poem><i>Sending all my stupid friends to oblivion!</i></poem> Suck it, bitches!
