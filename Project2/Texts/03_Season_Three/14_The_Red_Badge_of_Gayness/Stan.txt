Ready? 1-2-3-4.  That's it, Cartman, you can't be the drummer! Alright alright. Let's just try it again. 1-2-3-4.  Cartman, I'm the leader of the Reenactment Fife and Drum Squad, and I say you play the flute! Where the hell is Cartman? If he misses the orientation, they're not gonna let him in the reenactment.  He'd better! Dude, that's not cool. Cartman, what the hell are you doing? You can't just come to a Civil War reenactment dressed up like General Lee, fatass! Hoohoo what a dumbass! It's gonna be rad having Cartman be our slave. Cartman, you can't do that! Run for your life, dude!  Yeah, but it doesn't matter, because the bet was that the South doesn't win the ''war''! And the South ''still'' didn't win the ''war'', dipshit! Dude, my mom is sooo pissed at my dad for going to Kansas. Oh here comes the bus.  Butters? Are you the only one that came back? ''What'' battlefield?!  God dammit, that fat piece of shit! That would suck so much ass. I'll go get my grandpa. He'll help us. Where's the Confederate Army now, Butters? Oh, boy. This is worse than I thought.  Mom wants you to come home. Oh, my God! They killed Kenny! I know! But we'll have to wait until dark. There, you see? We take the s'more schnapps, and by morning they're all gonna wanna go home. Now we just wait until morning. Check-mate, Cartman. Pretty soon, you're gonna be our slave.  Haha! You lose, fatass! Where are you going?  Oh, no.  Give up, fatass! There's over a hundred National Guards down here. No, you can't do that. Our dads are there. Aw, dammit! Dude, let's just give up right now and accept that we have to be Cartman's slaves. Well, we've tried everything, Grandpa. What else can we do? Yes, and I'm Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederacy. Men, I want you all to know that as President of the Confederacy, I am hereby surrendering.  It's finally over, Cartman. You lost! Don't touch me.  Now, the first thing I want you to do for us is- Awwww! Aw, the hell with it. Let's go home.  Thanks a lot, Bill Clinton!
