So, um, ahem, South Park kind of sucks now. You guys wanna bail?  It's just, you know, it used to be nice and laid-back here, but now it's all  Uuuuhhh, you know? Like like now everybody's all Uuhh-uuhhh. Let's bail. You wanna bail, Stan? Nothing! I just... You know, we don't have to live here, we can live anywhere.  All these fancy new restaurants and shops and  everyone wants to live here! A bowl of City beef costs ten bucks now, for Christ's sake. And there's nowhere to shop but stupid Whole Foods! I had to take out a second mortgage on the house.  I had to, Sharon! It isn't my fault! It's the Man. Don't you see? The Man... is pricing us out of our own town. Don't you get it? That's just what they want. Nobody cares about the people who lived here before. They want us to move, 'cause they wanna knock our houses down and build more lofts and villas!  Oooff! Hey, it's Caitlyn Jenner!  Principal Victoria?  One of what? Hey, fuck you.  Garrison? The hell is wrong with you?! I don't know what you're talking about.  All right, it was kind of my idea. What? To take one area of town that was rappy and gentrify it for the local people to enjoy? I thought we could keep it contained. Oh my God. What does it mean? Not me. If PC Principal has been using us, I'll take the bastard down myself.  Whoa whoa whoa, guys, whoa! We can't just go walking in there. This is a safe space. We're not allowed past this. When you breach a college safe space, you're crossing the most sacred human boundary there is. Nonononono, look, this is very real, and very important in PC culture. Every human has a right to a safe space and it cannot be entered. Wow, how did you-?  Whoa. It doesn't make sense. Someone's always here. Click on that. What is that? Whoa, whoawhoawhoa wait wait wait. What, what were we doing again?
