...How? I'm not being in any  faggy boy band! Wait a minute. There's only four of us. So, all boy bands have five members. 'N Sync, Backstreet Boys, New Kids on the Block. All had five members. It was? I promised my mom I'd let him try.  Come on, Cartman! You haven't liked anybody else! Dude, what are you talkin' about? That was awesome! Me too.  I wanna be the tough one.  I wanna be the tough one! Jews are tough! Since Abraham, fatass! Jesus Christ! Wow. I feel so rejected. Run for it!  Dude, what's wrong with your leg? Wow. There must be at least 20 people out there.  He'll be here. Stan wouldn't douche. Hell no! I'm not being part of a four-member boy band! We'll look stupid! It's Stan!  Dude, where the hell have you been?! You bastards! Dude, he's pretty dead. We don't have a fifth member, Cartman! We made two dollars. Yeah. ...Yeah. That's gonna suck. Hey, Cartman, do you think God's getting mad at you for not making $10 million?
