 I love you, Satan. Hey, you. You... were out all night. Satan. You know you're not a very good liar. You went and saw Saddam, didn't you?  Satan, I understand. I still feel secure and safe with you.  What? What's wrong? I said it's okay. Well, what more do you want from me? Satan, I'm a '90s man. I cry when I need to. I share my feelings and I keep my mind open about everything.  Now you're starting to hurt my feelings. '''''Agghhh!'''''  'Scuse me. Excuse me. Yeah, well, where was I gonna go? Detroit? Hey, it's alright. All that matters is that I'm back, and we're together forever. Right? Yeah. It's me. Yeah... Do you have a couple of minutes to go for a walk? Yeah. Just real quick. Around the park or somethin'. No, I just want you to go for a quick walk with me. Please? Saddam, I get the feeling that you don't like me very much. Look, Satan is a very important person to me. And I know he's an important person to you, too. So don't you think it's best for us to just... try and get along? I realize that some things about me bother you. So I'd like to hear what those things are so that I can work on them. '''''Agghhh!'''''  '''''Oh God!''''' '''''Nooo! Agh!'''''  Ow!  Ow..!  '''''Aagghh!'''''  You have? Satan. Can we go for a walk in the park? Fine.
