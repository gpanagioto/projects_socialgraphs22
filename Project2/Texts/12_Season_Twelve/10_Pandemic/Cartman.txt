Shave your balls? Why would you shave your balls? What girl is gonna see your balls? Yeah I saw like three of those bands down in Denver yesterday. All their crappy music sounds the same.  Shut up already! I will play this card to move Kyle back seven spaces...  So? How much? Really? Are you sure?  Oh my god. We're gonna make so much fucking money you guys. Craig, dude, how're you doing, bro? Cool, awesome. Um, Craig, remember how you were tellin' us how your grandma gave you a hundred bucks for your birthday? Come on in, Craig. Have a seat. Welcome.  And we'll double your money in one afternoon, Craig. Craig, don't be an asshole. And a one, and a two, and a-   Hey! Heyheyheyheyhey!  No trabajar aqui! Vaya! No pleya la musica en la promenade! No es bueno! No! No es bueno! [grabs the siku and throws it away. The band stops playing. The siku player looks at his empty hands and goes after the siku] No, no es bueno! No trabajar aqui! Ha!  And we're white. You're being extremely negative, Craig.  There's no talking to this guy.
