You guys, you guys! Chef is going away.  Forever. Chef said he's been bored, so he joining a group called the Super Adventure Club.  Dude, how are we gonna go on? Chef was our fuh...f-ffriend.   He's back! But are you back for good? Right. Uh, see ya.  Well, look. he said he's happier now. Maybe he just needs to rest up a little.  Yeah, but whatever, I'm just glad he's back for good. What?? Dude, what are you saying?? ...WHAT?? No he's not. No he's not. NO! No, Chef, we don't wanna make love to you! Well look, he spent the last three months with that adventurers' club. Maybe they know what happened to him. NO!!  Knew what? You need to see a psychiatrist, Chef. It's for your own good. Yeah, he joined the Super Adventure Club, and they convinced him having sex with children was okay with a little thing that goes ''whrrrrrr''. No, that's the Adventure Club. The Super Adventure Club has sex with children. Having sex with women. This isn't working. Come on guys, we might as well go.  Chef, we're leaving. He's remembering. Where's Chef?! What have you done with him?! Oh Jesus, here we go. We don't wanna hear it. Immortal? Yeah, it's way, way more retarded. We're not leaving without Chef.  No, you don't understand! They've got our friend in the Deprivation Room!  Come on, Chef! We made it! Chef, come on!  Chef, we love you. NO!  Oh my God...They killed Chef! Come on, let's go. Oh hey Kyle. Helping my Dad pick out some cool new power tools. What are you doing? Yeah?  Going away party? What do you mean?  Moving away?? Kyle can't move away! Where's the going-away party?  Kyle? Kyle! What?! Kyle! Du-what is going on?! Mr. Broflovski, please. Kyle's my best friend. Well... Maybe they'll change. Nooo! I will. I ''will'' get everyone to drive hybrid cars! I swear it! ''Come on, people. Come on, people now. [Cartman and Butters enter]'' I'm writing a song about the importance of hybrid cars, so maybe people will change their ways. Well if I have any chance of getting Kyle back, I have to get people to stop driving SUVs! You know, Cartman, you may be stoked now, but I bet you're gonna find that withuot Kyle around to rip on, your life is empty, and hollow. ''Come on, people. Come on, people now.'' ''Come on, everybody be people now''  Yeah. Ow! What?! Smog? There's never been smog over South Park before. Smug? No, no, I'm ''asking'' if there's a listing for Broflovski in San Francisco! They just moved there! Oh crap, Ranger McFriendly. What is that? George Clooney's acceptance speech? What about San Francisco?  I'm gonna try and warn Kyle to get out of San Francisco. Can't somebody else operate this? I can't really reach. No... What? Kyle! Dude, what happened??   Dude, I'm so glad you're not dead.  What?? What?? Kyle! What the hell is going on this time?! Dad?  So? Oh come on, people. You really think anybody's gonna be that pissed off about a cartoon?? They censored the image of Mohammad? How? Yeah, lots of people like ''Family Guy''. What? What's the big deal? Yeah, you rip on people's religion all the time! The hell's going on now?! Does this mean we don't have school all week? Dude, we can't go anywhere. They've shut down the airports and the buses. To Los Angeles? Dad, I don't wanna bury my head in the sand. Yeah. Dad, this is stupid. Who?  Pass it to me, Cartman? Cartman, stop hogging the goddamned ball! Oh, hey Dad. Aw, he's all right, Dad. He was just trying to warn us about ManBearPig. He could be half bear, half manpig. But I feel kind of bad for him, Dad. I don't think he has any friends. Hello?  Oh man... Hi Mr. Gore. I know. Eh look, I'm sorry but, we're all kind of busy. No, no, it's not that. Ih it's okay, Mr. Gore, I, I believe you. Yeah, I'm sure ManBearPig needs to be stopped. I'm just... I'm just scared that I can't do anything to stop him. ...Yes, I'm serial. Come on, you guys, Al Gore doesn't have any friends. We'll just make an appearance at his little meeting and then we'll go.  Yyeah, you know, Mr. Gore, uh, my dad's a geologist, and he said that ManBearPig probably isn't in Colorado. NO. Well, this was a great meeting. Wasn't it, guys? But, we gotta get goin' to school now. Mr. Gore, I I think we should stay with the tour group. Oh no! Help! Help!  Me?? Maybe there's another way out of here.  Cartman's right. First rule of survival is stay put and wait to be rescued. I'm sooo hungry. Do you think people even know we're here? Let's just try to sleep. Maybe help will come tomorrow. Dude, he's really sick.   Huh? What? Have they come for us? Oh my God.  Cartman? Dude, can you hear me? How, dude? We c- we don't even know if that passage I found goes anywhere. Goddamnit, he's soo heavy! Cartman?  I can't keep carrying him, dude! I've got no strength! Kenny! Here, take my hand!  Hurry Kyle, the water's rising! Kyle! No! Agh. Just stay away from us, asshole! I was nice to you because I felt sorry for you, because you don't have any friends! But now I see WHY you don't have any friends! You just used ManBearPig as a way to get attention for yourself because you're a LOSER!! Cartman, seriously, you need to see a doctor.  You can't stay here. Dude, have you lost more weight? Dude, we're not killing your mom. Where am I supposed to get a gun? I'm not shooting anybody.  Dude! We've been waiting forever! H-hang on, guys, my dad wants something. What?!  I ''am'' socializing, r-tard. I'm logged on to an MMORPG with people from all over the world, and getting XP with my party using TeamSpeak. All right, sorry guys. So where to now?  This is the guy that kept killing us after you went to bed! He's a way higher level than us. It isn't fair. Oh my God, he killed Kenny!  Whoever he is, he is one tough badass. Yeah, we bought your game, and played it online, but every time we log in, some other player comes in and kills us! Yeah? Well this guy does it anyway! Dude, we have to try. Come on, let's do this! Look! There he is! Dad?? Dad, get off our teamspeak line!  That's it, screw this game! Dude, we're done. we're sick of getting killed all the time. We can't ''get'' to a higher level because that dude doesn't let us finish quests! I'm in.  +15 agility. 'K. That's Ã¼bercool. Wait, I think I see him. Yeah, yeah, he's here in Goldshire. Okay, he sees us...He's targeted us. Kyle!  Kyle! Dude, what's wrong? Oh, Jesus, he's got it bad!  Hurry dude! Kyle, you have to keep playing. We can't do this without you now! Come on!  You can't go to the bathroom, you're stacking sunder armor! Dude, I'm almost dead.  Dad? Not now! Dad, how did you get that?! Bring up your inventory screen: Control-I... I got it!  Dad! Dad, no!  Dad? Dad? I know you do, Dad. We did it! Yeah. I can't believe it's all over. What do we do now? Got it. A wall toilet for peeing in. Did they find out who crapped in the urinal yet? Yeah, at least one-fourth.  Kyle! Dude, do you mind telling me why CIA guys  are coming to my house and questioning me about you?? Well why did you have to involve me?? All right, look, I've been doing a lot of research on the Web and I found an organization who says they can prove you weren't involved in 9/11. Come on. We'll go out the back so they don't see you.  There's just one thing I need to know before we go: you weren't responsible for 9/11, right?  Hi, we were hoping you can help us. My friend is being blamed for 9/11. Dude, why would the government attack its own buildings? JESUS CHRIST!! He was right. You DID cause 9/11. Why?!  Is the whole government in on this?  All right, now we have to switch over to Interbus 65. We made it dude.  We should be home in less than eighteen hours. Then we'll tell everyone what we saw. Yeah, our eyes are finally open, dude. It's like waking up for the first time. Well dude, maybe we're just super badass. Have you thought of that?  What who said? Oh God! Who are you? Aw Jesus... How come you couldn't just go home, dude? That's all we had to do! It was all planned out! Because it was me. I'm the one who took a dump in the urinal. The stalls were full and I didn't wanna miss recess! I didn't think it would turn into such a big deal!  Oh man, now everyone's gonna know. Why did the stupid Hardly Boys have to be so good at solving mysteries? Yuh. Whattaya mean? A bunch of pissed-off Muslims. Sure dude. Dude, what's the matter? ...Wow. Dude, I really don't see a problem. Go ahead, Kyle, do it.  Dad! Dad! If you look in the mirror and say Biggie Smalls' name three times, he doesn't come and get you, right?? It does work!! We're really sorry, Mr. Smalls. It's still three weeks. Dude you don't look so good, Cartman. Do what? Dude, no way. Well there could still be a god. Couldn't evolution be the answer to how and not the answer to why? I wasn't talking about spaghetti.  I'm sorry, Mr. Jarvis, it's just that... I have to get up at 4 a.m. to deliver your paper and then I go to school all day.  Yeah. Why?  Hey, hey! What are you doing?! Yes! No-dude, I need my bike to do my job!  Hi, my name is Stan Marsh. I was told to come down here and try to- I ''got'' a job, but without my ''bike'' to do my ''paper route'', I can't ''make the money''! See?  Look, I really need my bike. What do I have to learn?! This isn't fair! ...Yeah?  Me? Oh boy. Uh, all right, guys, over here? Come over here.  We've got a lot of work to do and not much time to do it in. My name is Stan and I'm your new coach. Now we just need to kind of organize a little bit and practice our- All right, fine, go ahead. S- hold it a while, okay? When you shoot the puck to another player. All right, all right, shut up! We're gonna practice! You two guys play defense, and you play goalie. Why not?! What, you got asthma or something?  What? Ah, it's okay. Don't cry.  Oh Jesus, can we just practice? NO!   Jesus Christ.  I got a new job. I'm finally gonna be able to pay off all the money I owe. I'm working with the Pee Wee Hockey League. I'm not playing, I'm coaching.  What are you talking about?  I remember going to Shakey's afterwards.   All right, guys. Tonight is our big game against Adams County. We still have all day to practice. Oh Ohhh. ... I don't know. No, I think you oughta.  Oh uh, hey Nelson. Dude, I can come back later. Is this a bad time for you? Wugh, I'm not sure. I would... think that... it's a lot like it was before you were born? Ogh. Goddammit, dude, I don't know. No, what I mean is, nobody really knows, see? But everyone does it. I mean, it's not like everyone else gets to live and only ''you'' have to die. Everyone's gonna die. You feel better now? Okay, great. Look, I, I gotta get to the stadium, but uh... hang in there? All right?  No- dude, I told you I can't do that. Okay.   Coach, can I talk to you for a second?  Look, there's a kid in my team who's got cancer, and, he wants us to win this game really bad, so, could you just... give us kind of a break? All right, guys, listen.  Relax! If we lose we're not gonna be murderers. Let's go, Park! Come on! Get near the puck!  Tie? Well, what does ''that'' mean? Hello? How are you feeling? Uh, hi Doc. How's he doing? Oh boy. But what can I do? Well, ah, I mean... Yeah... yeah, we'll beat 'em. Well, sure we can. Look, guys. I believe in you. Nelson believes in you. Doesn't that count for anything? They're not gonna kill us.  Haven't you guys ever seen these movies? We're just supposed to rally together, believe in ourselves, and we win in the end. Hey that's right. We need a ringer.  It's just for one game. He won't get hurt, I promise.  Dad, I'm working on my game plan right now.  All right, let's go win! Huh? S-so then we win? Hey. Hey, you can't do this.  We've, we've been through all this stupid emotional crap! But it isn't supposed to end like this!  Play the Red Wings? Jesus Christ!  Stop! Stop this! Hey, can they do that?? Going away? For how long? Draw two card, fatass. Yeah! Chef! I can't believe you're back! Well, I- guess we'll see you in school tomorrow, Chef. Yeah. I'm sure whatever that Super Adventure Club does is pretty tiring. Yeah. I hope he makes his Salisbury steak with buttered noodles!  Like what? Weirdo.  Good. ...Chef?? A-are you ok? This doesn't make any sense! Goddammit, Chef isn't like that! Something funny is going on around here!  Chef, the police are asking questions about you! Chef, CHEF! You need to get out of here before you get arrested, all right?! He didn't want us for sex, fatass! Something is making him say those things. Something must have happened to Chef while he was gone. Maybe he hit his head or, or got stuck in some quantum time vortex. All right, come on guys! Ahh, hi, can we speak to the head guy or something? Uh, hi. Our friend joined your club a while back, and now he wants to molest kids.  Well, we thought you went exploring and like, hunting and stuff! ...Dude! Dude, what are you doing? Just what the hell is that thing?! HA! I knew it! The reason Chef has been saying those terrible things about us is because he's been brainwashed! By this - fruity little club! All right, come on.  Hi, uh- our friend has been brainwashed by some fruity little club. But we don't have years! If Chef keeps this up, he's gonna go to jail forever! No thanks. We're trying to unbrainwash our friend. Come on, Chef! You can do it! ...Do you realize how retarded that sounds? We're not going anywhere without Chef. No! Hey! Sorry, dude, but this fruity little club isn't taking our friend! Chef, come on! Here!  Get outside!  Yeah, he wanted adventure! Not a bunch of ridiculous bullcrap! Right Chef?  Chef? No! Chef, they've filled your head with lies! Can't you see that??  You bastards. YOU BASTARDS!! We're all here today because Chef has been such an important part of our lives. A lot of us don't agree with the choices Chef has made in the past few days.  So you see, we shouldn't be mad at Chef for leaving us. We should be mad at that little fruity club for scrambling his brains. And in the end, I know that somewhere out there... there's the good part of Chef... that's still alive in us all.  Dad, can we go home? All you ever do since you got this car is drive around and show it off!   What?!  Dad, can we go home, please? But Dad, I want- Aw, hey dude. What are you doing here?  Dad, let's just go!  Dad, Ike and I have been talking, and well, we feel that your new car is changing you. We're thinking that a lot of people in town starting too...  ...a-are starting to take offense at your actions. We feel like you're starting to become-hmm...  ...star-starting to become alienated from some of your friends. You do?? Righ!  Okay, good. What?? My Dad says he can't live here anymore.  So... what do ''you'' do for fun? Oh, no thanks. We don't do that stuff. Yeah, fine, Dad. Well... maybe I'll take just half a hit of acid. The acid. Dude, I'm totally tripping balls. Hey Stan. NO! Hybrid cars are a ''good'' thing! Hybrid cars don't cause smugness, people do.  Look, hybrid cars are important. They may even save our planet one day. What you all need to do is just learn to drive hybrids and not be smug about it. Yeah! Yeah, I guess so. Don't belittle my people, you fucking fatass!  I have no idea! I TiVo every episode. We can go to my house and see what they did. Okay you guys, check it out.  Dude, it's a good show. Hehaha, heh. That's it? That's all they did? Since when you care about being sensitive to people's religion, Cartman?! Uhhh... Dad, Dad, Jesus Christ! Mom, it was nothing. Mohammad just stood there and then drank some tea. No, ''Muslims'' can't show an image of Mohammad. Well good for them. They shouldn't! The writers are standing up and saying they aren't going to be intimidated! All right dude, what the hell has gotten into you?! I don't trust for one second that your sudden concern for the Muslim people is real! Dad? Are you sure this time? No! Ike? Iiike!  Ike!   I didn't come to stop you. I... I think you're right, Cartman. I want to help you get the ''Family Guy'' episode pulled. Look, Cartman, I don't know what's gotten into you, but... I I think it's pretty amazing. And I think it's real. You have to understand why I didn't believe you before. It's a long trip, dude. You're gonna need help. We can try and get the episode pulled together. I know. But just like you, I feel like I have to try. People can really get hurt, and a joke just isn't worth that. I got some sound advice... from an old friend.  Yeah!  I'm set! Let's do this! We got six days to make it to Los Angeles. If we keep our stops to a minimum, we should be able to get the episode pulled just in time.  Off the air? But... we're just going to try to get the Mohammad episode pulled.  This isn't what I signed up for! I ''like'' ''Family Guy''. Why do we have to get it off the air forever? But that doesn't mean it has to go off the air. You should like that show. Your sense of humor is just like ''Family Guy''.  You unbelievable son of a bitch. You never cared about the Muslim religion. Or the safety of people in America. You just want ''Family Guy'' off the air. What are you talking about?! I can't believe I let you scare me into taking your side. You used fear to make me stop believing in free speech. No!  I am NOT letting you go to that television studio and pretend... to care about safety and sensitivity to get a show ''you don't like'' off the air!  Ahhh!  You son of a bitch! I won't let you win! You hear me?! You just want ''Family Guy'' off the air... You son of a bitch! I won't let you win! What the hell is going on?  Who? Thanks a lot for the ride. I'll do everything I can.  Do you know which way the network president's office is? Look, my fat bastard friend is trying to trick the network into getting ''Family Guy'' off the air. Oh thanks, dude.  Ow!  Let me out of here, kid! Why are you doing this? Cartman! You fat son of a bitch! Well, a lot of people like ''Family Guy'' too! Who are ''you'' to decide it shouldn't be on the air?! Cartman, let me out of this stupid net!! WHAT?!  You fucking fatass! That kid and I had a long talk! I told him he was on a slippery slope to becoming a ''monster'' like you!  You are not. Killing. Family Guy!  Get out of my way or I'll kick your ass! Ow. Quit it! Ow. Quit it! No more timeouts, fatass!  Thanks, kid.  Sir! Mister television executive! Stop! Listen to me: the little boy who convinced you to pull the episode is a bastard child. He only wants you to pull it because he knows it will be the end of ''Family Guy'' forever! Pulling an episode because someone is offended starts a chain reaction. You'll have to pull more and more episodes until the show goes off the air completely. It's what happened to ''Laverne & Shirley''. What manatees??!!   No! You have to show Mohammad, Mr. President! Sir, just think about what you're doing to free speech! Noo! Wait! You can't listen to him! He's a lying deceitful monster who only wants ''Family Guy'' off the air! You can't do what he wants just because he's the one threatening you with violence! Yes, people can get hurt. That's how terrorism works. But if you give into that, Doug, you're ''allowing'' terrorism to work. Do the right thing here. Do the right thing, Mr. President. I wish that was good enough, but if you censor out Mohammad, then soon you'll have to censor out more. If you don't show Mohammad, then ''you've'' made a distinction what is okay to poke fun at, and what isn't. Either it's all okay, or none of it is.  Do. The right. Thing. Yes!  Dick Cheney?  Just play the game, fatass! Just take a shot or pass the ball, asshole! It's getting late! We know.  Okay, Mr. Marsh.  He's half man and half bearpig. That doesn't make any sense. Yeah, that's Cave of the Winds. It's a tourist attraction. Yeah, we've got school anyway. What do ManBearPig droppings look like? What? What are you doing?!  Hello? We're trapped in here! Hello, help! Forget it! They can't hear us! A-all right, let's split up and look for a passageway. E-everyone take a different direction.  Oh man, we're in big trouble here. You see anything, Kenny?? Cartman?? Cartman, you see anything?? Cartman, you okay??  You need help?? It looks like we're completely sealed in. Maybe we should go for it. Why? No, we'll stay here too. If we start wandering off, we're gonna get lost or killed. Let's just wait here and hope help comes soon. Aw, dude!  They saw us on the tour.  Dude, where do you keep going, Cartman? Dude, it's bad enough we have to sit here without you taking a crap every ten minutes! C-Cartman? Dude, what are you doing? Dude, get away from me! Stan! Stan, wake up! No, it's Cartman. Something's really wrong with him.   We can't wait here any longer! Dude, we've gotta get him out of here or he's gonna die. Maybe we should get out first. See if we can find a way out and then come back for him. Come on come on! Pull! What the hell is that?? What the hell is that?  Ruuun!  Car... Cartman! You've gotta swim! Kick with your legs! Yes you can! I need your help! We need to get our friend to a hospital right away! Dude, did Cartman just crap treasure? You made us pull you to safety because you ate treasure?! You son of a bitch! You're not staying at my house either. Dude, don't kill your mom. That's not cool. NO, Cartman!   If you didn't eat so much, you wouldn't have diarrhea all the time, fatass! Come on, we have to finish the quest in Stonehaven.  See where I am? It's this way.  Wow, look at all these people playing right now. Who is this? It's all right. He can't kill us unless we agree to duel.   Who is that guy? The past...four nights we've tried to play, he shows up and kills us! He's targeting us. Ike, look out!  We don't have a choice, dude. That guy killed our characters 14 times. Boars? Dude, boars are only worth two experience points apiece. Do you know how many we would have to kill to get up 30 levels? Dude, my mouse-clicking finger hurts. Me too. Hang on, I'm chaining my fire spells for max range. Hold on, this fight could last more than twelve hours. What if we run out of food? What's the autolocate macro? Okay, right behind Stan. Casting...there's an 8-second cast time. No, ah, I'm an arcane fire mage. Cast on him again. Aaaa...  Carpal tunnel! Carpal tunnel! It's aaaah!  I can't. Just leave me behind. I'm out of mana, I told you. Attack!  Yeah yeah. That was such Ã¼ber pwnage Oh yeah. Oh God, here we go again! 9/11 was not a conspiracy, fatass! Not yet. Will you shut up about 9/11! Because anybody who thinks 9/11 was a conspiracy is a retard! Yes. I'm saying one-fourth of Americans are retards. Let's take a test sample: There's four of us, you're a retard, that's one-fourth. Where did you hear that?  Butters, you don't really believe that, do you? Goddamnit, you see what happens when you spread this stupid crap, fatass? [rolls his eyes] Oh no...  Oh Christ... Me??! Hey Tolkien.  All right, all right, I was not responsible for 9/11!  God-damnit!  Terrible. But, everyone thinks I was responsible for 9/11.  Aaaah! I don't know, dude. It's like everyone's putting pieces together that aren't there. It's not my fault. Really? ......Dude. They are? What? No no no. ...That's retarded. There's a lot of holes in the Theory of Evolution too; it doesn't mean it's wrong.  Code 234 What is it? Anthrax?! Stan, we can't be seen with this nutjob!  Aw, aw, awww! Eh-xcuse me, there's been a misunderstanding. Uh, Mr. President, my name is-  Really?  No. Way.  ...Really??  ...Really?? It just... doesn't seem right. Yeah... but doesn't it seem like we got out of the White House pretty easily? I mean, it seems like it would be pretty hard to escape from the White House with everyone chasing you, and we just kind of... ran out.  Hey!  Dude! What the hell is going on?! Dude, we aren't going to kill you.  Who the fuck are you?! Do you mind telling us what the hell is going on?? You f-figured this thing all out? Why would the government want people to believe they caused 9/11? I knew it! You didn't plan 9/11 and you really didn't shoot that guy! Well why don't you just tell people the truth?! Stan! What the fuck?! You knew this whole time? Why?  What?? So you blamed the government?! So wait, wait: Stan took a dump in the urinal and he contacted the conspiracy Web site? But the conspiracy site was run by the government? So then, who was responsible for 9/11? Huh? What's he doing at his teacher's house? Hello?  Oh God!  What the hell is going on??  Really?! What's there not to understand?! He's a little young, don't you think?! All right! We're getting the hell out of here!  Ike, you can't possibly want this. We have to tell Mom. Ike?  This is nuts. Mom, Dad, have you ever met Ike's kindergarten teacher?  Yeah. Well, she likes Ike a whole lot. Yyeah, except maybe it's not perfectly great, because to some degree, Ike and Ms. Stevenson are having an-. Mom, there might be something that you should look into about Ike staying after school all the time- Would you excuse us for a second?  Mom, I think maybe you should talk to Ike about love and sex!  My name is... Brad. And uh I need to report a crime. Anonymously. Well, I attend South Park Elementary, ah-and... w-one of the teachers is having sssex with a student. Well, it isn't a guy teacher. It's a woman. Yeah. She's having sex with a boy.  Well no, not really. It's the Kindergarten teacher, Miss Stevenson. Yeah.  Yes. What?! No, you don't understand- Yeah. I think so. Hay! He's totally underage. She's taking advantage of him.  Gargh! Guys, can I talk to you? I need you to keep quiet about this, all right?  My little brother and his tea- Not now, Cartman! I have really serious problems! The kindergarten teacher is having sex with my little brother. It's ''not'' cool! Ike isn't old enough to understand.  "stick it inside her and pee" You guys don't understand! His wacko teacher is like a schoolgirl! They pass notes to each other in the classroom, they have sex at her house over lunch break,  They sneak out during class and make out in the hallways! Well they're doing it! Wow. I think I owe you one, Cartman.  Okay, okay. I did have something to do with it. But someday you're gonna realize it was for the best. What? I'm dead to you? What? Ike, are you okay?  Dude, my brother's in Milan. There's nothing I can do. How do you know that? Who's Beth? Can we get going now, please?! Oh crap!   No! Ike, don't do it! Ike, ''please''. I know your first love seems like the only love, but trust me, it's not. You have so much life ahead of you.  Ike, you need to have a life. Have fun. ''Then'' ruin it by having a serious relationship.  Ike!  I ''am'' doing it.  Biggie. Smalls... Biggie Smalls... Fine!  Then YOU do it, you're so tough!  Prove it! You're afraid to do it, too. He's right. It's just a spooky story. I can do it. It just got... look, it just doesn't matter, because it's not true. ...Smalls.  Holy crap!!  See? You can still make it for the end of the party. Will you shut up already?!  Well there's nothing you can do, so you just have to be patient. No. You'll die, retard! Yeah, I hate you, but I'm not going to help kill you. Hello?  Hello? What do you want?! I'm not going to help you freeze yourself, Cartman! It's a stupid idea!  ... Uh huh. ... I'm hanging up now. Suck my balls, fatass. Aw Goddammit, now you've made me miss my ride! My whole day is screwed up because of you!  You got it, Stan! Stan, I told you. My mom doesn't want Ike playing hockey. She thinks it's dangerous. All right, but it's gonna take more than one good player to beat the champions, Stan. You'd better have a really good game plan. I'm sorry boys. Wow! What's the meaning of life? Why are we here?  Good-bye! ''[goes into the plane and disappears from the door. The door closes and the plane taxis away. The town waves good-bye to Chef again and Cartman bawls uncontrollably in a high-pitched voice. The plane climbs into the sky]..'' Hello there, children! Well, it's true. That's right. Yeah! N-No! No. That's right. That's right, Randy!  Thank you, Jimbo. That's right! Thank you. Good-bye everybody. You bet! Good-bye, children!  Hello there, children! How's it goin'? Well, how about I meet you boys after work and we make love? Come on, children! You're my sexual fantasy. Let's all make sweet love. I want to stick my balls inside your rectum, Kyle. I'm gonna make love to your asshole, children. Hello there, children! Oh really? Well, let's all go home and make love. Kenny, how would you like to sodomize my black ass? I specialize in your asshole, Kyle.  Come on, Children. Let's all go home and make love. I just like to make love up your butt. Doctor, do you have- children? Have you all been sodomizing your children too? I'm gonna make love to the children.  Aw, come on, children. Let's go home. God-damn! Wait a minute. Children! What have I done? I'm goinna- I'm gonna- I'm gonna make love to you woman, 'gonna lay you down by the fire! Hey children, everybody! I'm back!  Ow. Oh!  Childern!  Children! Run!   Get the hell out of here, children! Ack.  Ah! POOOT!  Chef?? What kind of questions do you think adventuring around the world is gonna answer?! I hope you're making the right choice. Hey everybody! Chef's back! But now that you're back here, does that mean you're not in the Super Adventure Club anymore? Yeah, ever since he got that new hybrid he thinks he's better than everyone else. Can you believe some people still don't drive hybrids?  It's okay!  Welcome to Muslim-Sensitivity Training. It is important for us to understand why the Muslim feel the way they do, and why we can never show an image of Mohammad. Kyle, you're not being very sensitive. Let's all look at ''why'' Muslims are upset:  Now put yourself in the shoes of a Muslim. It's Friday night, but you can't have sex, and you can't jack off. There's sand in your eyes and probably in the crack of your ass, and then some cartoon comes along from a country where people ''are'' getting laid, and mocks your prophet. Well you know what? I'd be pretty pissed off too! Why would they-?  Who are those people? And so, class, that is when Joe Lee countered back to Aniston and said things like-  Oh hello, Mr. Mackey. Okay, thank you, Leroy, thanks for sharing your dumb little frog with the class. Okay, anybody else have anything for Show and Tell? All right, Eric, you can go next. Mr. Mackey!  We got him. We caught the person that did it. Principal Victoria, it is wrong!  Evolution is a theory! A hare-brained theory that says I'm a monkey! I am not a monkey!! I'm a woman! I warn you, Principal Victoria! Those students are not prepared to hear this stuff! All right kids, it is now my job to teach you the theory of evolution. Now I, for one, think evolution is a bunch of BULL CRAP.  So there you go! You're the retarded offspring of five monkeys having butt sex with a fish-squirrel! Congratulations! Yeah? You see? I ''knew'' that would happen. Whatever.  Retarded fish-frogs. Well, you're a faggot!  Continue. So you ''are'' saying that we're all related to monkeys. Do you see monkeys at the zoo?! They crap in their hands and throw it at people! What about the fact that if I believe in this crap, you're gonna go to hell?! Doesn't that bother you a little?  AHA! I've got you, you snake in the grass!! I found you out!! And if I'm a monkey, then I might as well ''act'' like a monkey, huh?!  Don't ask me, I'm a fuckin' monkey!!  Principal Victoria, I was simply trying to make a point to Mr. Dawkins about the incongruity of some scientific statements. What?? What?!  You d-you do? Well I...  No! N-no! My, my husband is g-gone, ''dead''. Well,  I've got a date! I've got a date! My first real date with a real man since my sex-change operation!  Hey everybody! So I told my gynecologist, "you put so many things in my vagina, maybe I should charge you!"  Hehyeah, almost. Well... Well, you know, I'm... I'm open to stuff. Oh I'm not... I'm not ''totally'' into the whole God thing. I just... I just think, you know, you can't disprove God.  Hey everyone, I'm an atheist! No, I totally get it now! Evolution explains everything! There is no great mystery to life, just evolution and God's a spaghetti monster! Thank you, Richard! Would you like tuh...  head over to my place for dessert? Oh yeah! Yeah, I'm a monkey! Give this monkey what she wants! Yeah, pound my monkey hole, Richard! Yeah, I'm a monkey all right! ''[thinking] That's my man.'' That's right, kids. And so you see, there is no God. What?!  Do you believe in a flying spaghetti monster too, bubblehead?! Come on, you. You're gonna have to sit in the dunce chair!  What?? But Dick, you told me the world would be a better place without religion.  You've just been too soft on religious people in the past. Think about it, Richard. With your intellect and my balls, we can change the future of the world. You're the smartest man on earth, Dick. With me by your side, there's no stopping you. Oh, all right.  OHOH YEAH!! AHHH!!  Oh yeah! Yeah, I'm a monkey! Give this monkey what she wants! Dammit, who the hell is calling?! Uh oh. Not anymore. I've been fixed.  Richard, hold on. I can explain. Richard, come back, please!  Well go ahead and leave, you atheist faggot! Have fun mocking God in hell! You queer! I'm gonna miss him.   All right!  Uh, guys? Did Chef seem a little, uh, trippy to you? Oh boy oh boy, I can't wait to have Chef's lunch food again.  Excuse me? ...Man, I can't believe all this time, Chef just wanted us for sex. Yeah! Hey you guys, you know what they call a Jewish woman's boobs? Jewbs.  Oh, son of a bitch! No, Chef has always been super-cool. So what can we do?? Come on, bitch! Dance! Bitch, I'll twist your nuts off! It's ok Chef, Go on, remember! Look, If you wanna go around the world molesting kids, that's totally fine. But why do you need Chef?! Kenny! Spin Blossom Nut Squash! Run Chef! A mountain lion!  A grizzly bear! Maybe- maybe he's still okay.  No, really. They say the last thing you do before you die is crap your- Oh never mind.  Who?  Kyle? Why would I invite Kyle? You guys, this is ''our'' party. That no-good back-stabbing Jew rat is finally leaving! Come on, everyone! Let's sing! ''Nanana na! Nanana na! Hey hey hey! Goodbye Kyle!''''' Dude, what are you doing? THAT's gay, heh. Why do you want Kyle back?? Don't you see how awesome it is without him?  Haha! Take that, Jew boy! I guess you Heebs can't even play video football! You know Butters, you make for a lousy Jew. No, no! Don't apologize, you asshole! Who?  The smug?  I don't have a choice. Somebody has to get into San Francisco and warn Kyle's family to get out before the storm hits. You don't know San Francisco, Butters.  All right, Butters, I'll be tethered to you through this cord. It's my only lifeline, so make sure it stays taut. If you stop hearing my voice, for the love of Christ, start reeling me in with all your strength. I'm not doin' it for Kyle.   Butters, are you there?! I've started to enter the smug. I'm about a quarter mile in. Can you give me an EL? Yes. It's just beyond yet another wine and cheese store. Turning right at O two four niner.  Butters?! Butters, I think I'm here! 2419 Castillo?! Mr. Broflovski! Mr. Broflovski, there a smug storm! We have to go! Oh my CHRIST!  Kyle? Kyle!   Well, looks like you're back for good, huh Kyle? We just can't get rid of you, can we, you sneaky Jew rat! Ah, that's better.  You TiVo every episode of ''Family Guy''? Yich.  Yich. Oh man, that's not cool! Seriously, that is not cool. What's the big deal? You guys, they just made fun of the religion of an entire group of people.  What, you guys think that's okay?! Do you care at all about people's feelings?! That's different! I'm just a little boy! That's a cartoon! Millions of people watch it! How would you feel, Kyle, if there was a cartoon on television that made fun of Jews all the time?! Huh?! I'm telling you guys, it's wrong! It's WRONG!!  Yeah, Kyle. Maybe you think this is funny, but the rest of us don't. Mrs. Garrison, that is ignorant and racist! Muslims are mad because of ''Family Guy'', not because they can't jack off! Right, Wendy? What? Goddamned ''Family Guy''! Now they're just provoking people! It's like they ''want'' a holy war! You guys, this is serious! We have to do something! We have to go to the FOX network in L.A. We have to go and... try to get that episode pulled. You guys with me? Then we'll ride our Big Wheels. If that's what it takes, yes! We ''have'' to talk to the network! The ''Family Guy'' writers aren't gonna back down! Intimidated?! Is that what you think this is about, Kyle? All right, fine, Kyle. Forget the Muslim faith for a minute. People can get hurt. If ten people die because ''Family Guy'' just had to have their little joke, will you still think it's funny?  Come to try and stop me?!    Yeah. I do understand, Kyle. I've been doing the wrong things for a long time. Doing things for my own selfish reasons. I just wanna do something right, you know? Just this one time. You know we might not even make it into the studio. So what made you change your mind? Well Kyle, we'd better get going. Are you set? All right, let's roll!  Yes, and in just a few weeks from now, ''Family Guy'' will be off the air forever. It's simple television economics, Kyle. All it takes to kill a show forever is get one episode pulled. If we convince the network to pull this episode for the sake of Muslims, then the Catholics can demand a show ''they'' don't like get pulled. And then people with disabilities can demand ''another'' show get pulled. And so on and so on, until ''Family Guy'' is no more! It's exactly what happened to Laverne & Shirley. Because they made f-fun of Muslims, and and that's wrong.  Do you have any idea what it's like?! Everywhere I go, "Hey Cartman, you must like ''Family Guy'', right?" "Hey, your sense of humor reminds me of ''Family Guy'', Cartman."  I am NOTHING like ''Family Guy''! When I make jokes, they are inherent to a story! Deep, situational and emotional jokes based on what is relevant and has a POINT! Not just one interchangeable joke after another!! YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND! Well... I guess you won't be helping me now. No biggie. I don't NEED you to get the episode pulled!  Well then Kyle, I guess we- ...Oh my God, is that Tim McGraw? Kyle, stop it! Holy Crap!  Hahahaha! So long, Kyle!   This... explains everything.  Kyle, quit it! Stop it, Kyle! I'm gonna do whatever I can... to get that episode pulled before this gets out of hand. Kyle, stop it! So long, Kyle! Ma'am, I need to speak to the president of this network right away. It's regarding ''Family Guy''. I demand that the Mohammad episode be pulled before it airs tonight! It's incendiary, it's offensive to Muslims, and people can get hurt! It's wrong! It's WROOONG! Dude, can I go before you? So... you don't like ''Family Guy'' either, huh? So what's your plan? You're gonna ask the president of the network nicely to take it off the air? Look, kid, if you hate a TV show, all you have to do is get an episode pulled. Pretty soon the show is compromised and it goes off the air. Yes. So my plan is to use this whole Mohammad thing as a way to ''scare'' the network into pulling tonight's show. I'm going to use fear to get them to do what I want. ...No, it isn't like terrorism. It IS terrorism. This is manipulation at its highest level; you should let me handle this. Really? What's the worst thing you've ever done? Wow, that's pretty hardcore. Geez. That's like this one time, when I didn't like a kid, so I ground his parents up into chili and fed it to him. Seeya.  Hello, gentlemen, ladies. My name is little Danny Pocket. And I won't take much of your time. Please excuse my tiny crutch; it's the only way I can get around these days. Ow... You see, my father worked for a newspaper in my native country of Denmark. His newspaper showed an image of Mohammad and, two days later, terrorists suicides bombed his building. I was in the lobby when it happened.  Ow.. I'll certainly do my best.  Ow.  Yes, and then ''Family Guy'' is as good as dead.  It won't take long, sir.  Ow...  Yes, I'm totally excited. ''Family Guy'' is so funny.  What are they? ''Family Guy'' is written by manatees?  Of course, it all makes sense now. Waitwaitaminute waitaminute. These... manatees demanded that Mohammad be shown? How? Manatees don't talk! Oh... yes, yes. Um  hello, manatees. I, I think you should allow the network to pull your episode with Mohammad. See, I'm the victim of a, a terrorist attack and... terrorists might come after you if you- Why not?  Son of a bitch.  Hello, Kyle. Looks like you've run into a little snag in your plan as well. You came so close to stopping me, didn't you, Kyle. There was just one thing you didn't count on: that more people besides me hate ''Family Guy''. Not yet! But I've come up with a new plan. I've learned how to make the ''Family Guy'' writing staff stop working! As soon as everyone goes on their lunch break, I can sneak back in. Good, Kyle! That's good anger you're showin' there! See that?! That's emotional character development based on what's happening in the storyline! Not at all like ''Family Guy''. Now, if you'll excuse me, Kyle,  I've got some idea balls to remove from a manatee tank.  Sir, ''you'' are in charge of this network, not them. Maybe it's time you showed them who's in charge. I did it. I... AM... ''GOD''!!! ''Family Guy'' is going off the air! No more ''Family Guy'' for me, mon frÃ¨re! How the hell did you get out? Aw, God damnit, you gave him one of your gay little speeches, didn't you?! You're too late, Kyle! The president of the network is pulling the episode! ''Family Guy'' is as good as dead!  I can't let you do that!  Ugh. Kyle! Stop it! Ow. Quit it, Kyle! Bleh. Kyle!  Stop it! Ow. Quit it, Kyle! Leh- Kyle! Let go- Okay okay come on, time out. Kyle, time out! Time out! Time out.  I d-ow! Uh. Ah. Sh-gah. Okay. Okay. Time out! Kyle t-time out! Time out! Time out! Time out! Time out! Time out! Time out! Time out, Kyle! Ay! Ay! Kyle! Kyle! Get the... Get the- Kyle! Kyle, dude, that was- that was in the balls! Dude, serious- seriously! That was in the balls! No hitting- No hitting in the ''balls''!  Go ahead, Mr. President! Continue what you were doing! No! Think about the people who could get hurt! Okay, I'll make it easy for you.  Pull the Mohammad episode, now! Shut up, Kyle! Give the orders to pull the episode, Mr. President! No gay speeches, Kyle! No! No, I hate ''Family Guy''!!   Kyle, you can't block like that. Hang on. I'm going to do something killer.  God damnit, stop it, Kyle!  Let's just see who gets the ball this time, Jewboy!  Dude, what are you doing? No, dude, he's half man and half bear and half pig. Dude, why are we going to hang out with this guy? Ah I don't think so, dude.  You... have that kind of power? Somebody get us some help down hyah! Hello??  You'd better get us out of here, asshole! You just had to go and be nice to Al Gore! Now we're trapped in a cave!   Tr... treasure. I'm fine! This way is just a... dead end! Coming back to you now!  You guys go on ahead. I'm gonna... stay here, wait it out.  I just... I I don't feel very good. I'll just wa-, I'll just weigh you guys down. No, it's okay. You guys go on ahead. That's cool. I just... I just wouldn't go over there  if I were you guys. I just took a huge dump. I just... n-need to keep taking a crap. I got diarrhea, really bad.   Oh. Hey Kyle. How's it goin'? Not much. You know, just hangin' out. How've you been, man? Good? Yeah. It's nice talking with you, Kyle. See you around.   Meh, meuh urgh.  Mbeuh.  Beh. NO DON'T! Don't leave me here, you assholes. Don't leave me here to die.  Buh. Hurry you guys. You gotta get me out of here.  You guys, we've got no time! You gotta get me out!!  Yes you do!  No! Let me out of here! Let me out of here, you guys! Grab my hand. I can't kick! I can't! Kick yourself back to safety! No, you just have to save me.  No! No I'm fine!  I just need to get home, a-and rest.  It's mine! It's mine, you hear me?! I got it out of the cave; it belongs to me! Keep your greedy hands away! That's right, and I...  Fake treasure? Noo... NOOO!!  NOO! OW! Don't you think I'm hurting enough, Kyle?! Ah, ow!!  Dowww! Eh!  I'm sorry I handcuffed Billy Turner's ankle to the school flagpole. Okay, I'm sorry I handcuffed Billy Turner's ankle to a flagpole and then gave him a hacksaw. And then told him I had poisoned his lunch milk and that the only way he could get to the antidote in time would be to saw through his leg. Well he called me chubby! Well nice goin', asshole! You made my mom cry! Sure you do. You're a great mom.<br />''Who's got the greatest mom in the world?<br />I dooo.<br />My mom is number one in my heart.<br />It's true!''   Mom, are you deaf?! Somebody's at the door! Killer. I'm gonna be on TV now.  Mom, I want a Twinkie.  Ha! Hahahahahaha!  No thanks, I'd rather naught. The hell do you think you're doing? Stop trying to bogart my Xbox, you fat bitch! Time out?  And what exactly keeps me on the stool?  Ummm, no? All right, seriously, you're starting to piss me off now. I'm just gonna get down as soon as you move. ''[hooks up the X-Box again] Don't stop believing. Hold on to that feeling.'' Because you took my Xbox. Well, yeah. Yeah. I guess so. Well, I'm feeling confused, because I don't understand why you became a nanny. Right, but... if you love children so much, how come you're not a mommy? Why not? You're sterile, is that it?  Always the mom's maid and never the mom? Must be hard on you, knowing that the years are ticking away, your friends all getting married and all the while your uterus is slowly shriveling away, drying up, becoming totally worthless. Yes, let the anger come! Strike me down while you can! But it won't make your dried-up ovaries any more fertile!  You can stop talkin' behind my back; I'm right here, fruitcake. Not interested in me? Yeah, well I don't see why- Hey! Mom, this guy doesn't- Ah! Quit it! Look, Mexican, if you really think that you can- KNOCK IT OFF! I'm not fat! Ey! You think this is funny, you sonofabitch? Mom, this is degrading! Agh! Goddamnit! Aaarrgh!  Maaaa. Mommm.  Mommm. Mom, seriously, people are seeing me! Mom, don't you love me? Can't you see I'm unhappy right now? Mom!  God dammit stop ignoring me! This is abuse! I am a child, and I am entitled to attention! Quit it, mom! Ooo, Colonel? Give, give me the chicken. G-give me some chicken. Eh, what are you doing? I want chicken! Give me some Goddamned chicken! Mom, gimme, give me some chicken; I want some chicken, Mom!  Give me the chicken! Give me the chicken! Give me the chicken! Give me the chicken! Gih-  Okay, I'm fine. I'm cool now. May I have some chicken please? Suck my asshole, taco vendor! Goddamnit, you can't stand here and eat KFC in front of me!  Now hand it over! You can't do that to me, I- Goddamnit, you just can't- Seriously! Ey? Eh...   I hate you! I'm running away! Hey guys, I've got some pretty big news.  I ran away from home. Yeah, my mom just... doesn't care about me anymore, so I moved out. She didn't even try to stop me. It's gonna be tough livin' on my own. But I'll get by, somehow. Maybe you didn't hear me! I ran away! I don't have anywhere to sleep! I'm out on the street! All right, that's fine! Butters, I'll crash with you. Well what do you guys expect me to do?! Stay at Kenny's house?!  All right, I'll stay with Kenny. Let's go, man. Och! Well, I guess now we see just how supportive friends can be! When the chips are down you won't even lend a hand! I'll just go sleep on the street somewhere!  Hey Jimmy. You're not gonna believe this, but... I ran away from home. I just... I really need the support of my best friend right now. You are, Jimmy! We've always been best friends. We know everything about each other.  Craig, dude, I ran away from home. You're the first person I came to. I knew you'd take me in off the streets. ...Should that really matter at a time like this? This is bullcrap! Mom'll break soon. I can outlast her. All right, I'm back. Yes, well, hopefully you've learned your lesson! I've come back, but there's going to be some changes around here. That's super-interesting. But I've been out living in the streets for almost four hours! Make me something to eat. Aw, Goddammit! What is he still doing here?! What the hell is this?! Skinless chicken, boiled vegetables and salad?! This is just like Auschwitz! Oh my God. Bite-size Snickers? That's it. I'm calling child-protective services!  Mom, I want this guy OUT of here! You got it? If he's not gone, in two minutes, I will call social services on you! I am your son, and you ''will listen'' to me! You have no right to- Mon, know it off! I'm not gonna stand for th- Seriously! Mom- Seriously! Why are you... doing this-? Mom?! Mom? Mom... Who does she think she is, telling me to go brush my teeth?!  Jesus. What's happening to me? Guys, listen up. I really need your help this time. I've thought about it a lot and I've decided I have to kill my mom. She doesn't let me wear whatever I want anymore. Things have really gotten out of hand! My mom must die so I can have a place to live, but without her trying to run my life. She's like Hitler with all the demands she makes. Yes! I've lost almost ten pounds now. You see what I mean?? I totally know how it felt to be a Jew in the Holocaust now! I have to kill my mom. It's my only way out. She's Hitler! Would you have killed Hitler if you had the chance?!  You guys come into the house at 10:30 p.m. sharp, having given me enough time to get down to Perkins to be seen by everyone there. And then all four of you go upstairs to kill my mom. Well I can't kill her. I'm too obvious a suspect. Now, when you reach her room, Butters will keep a lookout while Kenny opens the bedroom door, Kyle puts a pillow over my mom's head, and Stan shoots her in the face. Well I don't know. That's your job, Stan! Do I have to think of everything here?! Okay, fine. Butters, you cover my mom's head with a pillow and Kyle can shoot her in the face. Oh! Well how about I do everything?! How does that sound?! I'll just do everything while you guys sit here and play video games?!  Fine! I'll do it by myself! You forced me to do this! You couldn't just love me as a son.   No! She's my mom, I can do whatever I want with her! It's more important that I live the way I want! She isn't an object I can own. Sh-she's a human being. Ugh. Eh. Maybe all these changes ''are'' good for me. Maybe...  Yeah Mom, it's okay. It's grapefruit and lean ham. Well, you told me I had to review my homework before class started. Tha... thank you? 'K Mom, you're embarrassing me, jeez.  I cleared up the table, Mom. I'm gonna go upstairs and make my bed now.  No, that's okay. Besides, I told Stan and Kyle we could work on our science project then. Could I... perhaps have... two Mega Rangers?  Oh, dude! I just took the biggest crap. Hey-where are you guys? Okay, I'm back. Well, I'm sorry, I had to take a dump! Hey, I don't need to take any lip from a frickin' girl! Heheh, totally, heheh. Yeah, come on, let's go!  I am the mightiest dwarf in all of Azeroth! Yeah, it's bullcrap. I'll bet half of these people are Koreans. Get out of here, asshole! Don't you have better things to do than going online killing people?!  That son of a bitch! He's a God damned butthole! My friends: as you all know, some giant butthole keeps logging onto Warcraft and killing all our characters. We've learned that the four of us can't fight him alone. But, if we all log in together!, we might have a chance. Clyde, Clyde!  I mean, I personally wouldn't stop him because I think he was awesome, but ''you'' would, right? When Hitler rose to power there were a lot of people who just stopped playing. You know who those people were? The French! Are you French, Clyde? Voulez-vous coucher avec moi, Clyde? (Would you like to sleep with me, Clyde?) All right, you all login from your computers at precisely 7:30.  We will meet here, on the plains of the elven forest near Westfall. My friends, to ''victory''! Butters, you said you were on your computer all the time! Butters, go buy World of Warcraft, install it on your computer, and join the online sensation before we all murder you. All right, you guys, this is it! When the attack begins, all warriors click on defensive stance. Everyone else, wait for Craig to cast his intellect buff. The battle is sure to be long, so make sure you all have your special abilities macroed to your keyboards. This shall be a day for all to remember! Let us bravely charge the fields of Azeroth!  From with- Butters? What the hell are you doing? You can't be the dwarf character, Butters, I'm the dwarf. So pick another one! I'm the dwarf, you stupid asshole! Log out, create a new character, and log back in!  Everyone hold!  Prepare to charge! Scroll over him with your mouse cursors! And...Right-click!  All right, Clyde, hit him with your crossbow!  Goddammit we lost Clyde! No, leave me alone, don't do-  What the hell are you guys doing?? Don't tell me you all quit playing World of Warcraft too?! Guys, when things look bad, you can't just give up on the world. Of Warcraft. I have a solution, you guys. That guy can kill us so easily because he's a super-high level, right? What if ''we'' were super-high level too? That's why we just need to log in and stay in the forest, killing boars. There's lots of computer-generated boars in Warcraft that die with just one blow. Yes.  or you can sit at your computer and do somethin' that matters. Keep clicking, Kyle! You can do it! All right, you guys. The Moment of Truth is here. It is time for our final battle. Everyone, log in!  Everyone equip healing potions to the hotbar if you haven't already. Uh, Kyle, go ahead and cast Arcane Brilliance to raise our intelligence. Nice. Stan, what enchantment does your Cloak of the Tiger have? Give the cloak to Kenny, he needs the agility boost for bow attacks. Don't worry, I have that covered.  Mom? More Hot Pockets! All right, everyone ready? Let's go get him!  Okay, everyone open your uplifts and autolocate to Stan. Command-0.  Kenny, get ready to turn on true-shot aura. At that moment, I will use intimidating shout. Okay, hit him with pyroblast, Kyle. Aren't you spec'd to reduce cast time? Christ... Everyone target scorpions. Kyle! Fire spell! Wait, we need Ben-Gay.  I'm going as fast as I can! All right, major stone shield potions should be...Oh God, I'm going to have diarrhea again. Ohhh...Duuuh... It's okay.  Mom? Bathroom! Bathroom! Bathroom!  All right, Kenny, drink your elixir of the mongoose. I'm now going to use mocking blow. Kyle, cast arcane missiles! Stan, what the hell are you doing?!  His shield and armor spells are down! Looks like you're about to get pwned.  Yes! Yeah! All right, yay. We did it you guys. We're totally heroes. What do you mean? Now we can finally play the game. Okay Kenny, add Eyes of the Beast to your hotbar. Stan, check your fury talents to boost your shots. Mr. Mackey, I think you might want to entertain that this is some kind of conspiracy, just like 9/11. Oh really?! Do you just believe everything you're told, Kyle? They aren't going to find out who did it. But they'll make up a scapegoat, send him to detention, and make us all believe it. It'll be 9/11 all over again. Kyle, why are you so afraid of the truth?! Oh really? Well did you know that over one-fourth of people in America think that 9/11 was a conspiracy? Are you saying that one-fourth of Americans are retards? ...There are soo many people who know the truth, Kyle. Uh Butters!  Butters, do you think 9/11 was just a plot by some angry terrorists, or do you think there was some kind of coverup? Aha! Do you see? I rest my case. That's right, Butters. What? People see the truth? You guys are blind! I can't believe that everyone here is just buying into what they're told by the media!  It is wrong for me to ask questions?<br />Is it wrong to seek the truth?<br />I just can't blindly accept their version.<br />I can't base my logic on proof.<br />Almost all the evidence points one way,<br />But I'm like Charlie Sheen and Gloria Estefan:<br />I need to know what really happened<br />On 9/11-leven-leven-leven-leven.<br />What really happened<br />On 9/11?[He's back at his computer once more and clicks on his mouse]Of course. It's so obvious. How did we not see it before?  Uh! Erh, eh. Uhhh!   but now look at this photo of the Pentagon. The hole is not nearly big enough. And if a plane hit it, where is the rest of the plane? So now, the inevitable question: if terrorists didn't cause 9/11, who did? . Kyle! Twelve contains the numbers one and two, just like the toilet yesterday where somebody went number two instead of number one! And one and two with 911 and you get 914! Drop the 4 and it's 91! Exactly the score Kyle got on his spelling test twelve days after 9/11! Who has the most to gain from 9/11?! Kyle! Who was nowhere to be found the morning the towers fell?! Kyle! Who dropped the deuce in the urinal?! Kyle! But probably the most damning of all is the evidence seen in this photo of Tower 2!  You almost got away with it, you sneaky butthole. And so then, I put my finger up my butthole, right? And I walked up to Kelly Nelson, and I said, "Do you smell lemon grass?", and she smelled my finger and puked! Hehehehe. Oh, guys, you should have been there. What? I didn't do it, Kelly Nelson's a liar! Oh, suck my balls you ginger Jew rat hall monitor! Punkass stoolie, who the fuck do you think you are?!  I'm juh duh duh duhhh! Do you know why you're a hallway monitor?! Because you don't have any friends! You should kill yourself! You should kill yourself!! Aw Goddamnit!  I'm sorry, Principal Victoria. I didn't mean to do it, how could I have been so foolish? The hall monit- me?  Auth- authoritah? Ahem. Me? That's cool. I'm done making my video anyways.  Hall pass! Show me your hall pass!  You know what this is? This is the mace that they use on bears, faggot! Now let me see your hall pass!   Argh!  What the fuck is this?!  Ike Broflovski! You littering my hallway, brah?! I found this in the hallway.  Hey! I don't tell you how to run your class, don't tell me how to run my hallway!   Hands?! Let me see those hands!  Where's your pass?! Show me your hall pass, brah! I ''knew'' it!  Look, brah, I had to bring you in, but I don't have any hard feelin's against you all right? Here, you need a smoke, brah? You've gotta give yourself over to Christ, brah. Jesus is Lord. You can go one direction in life, or you just walk around the hallways without a hall pass. Or you can see the light, brah.  Brahs, it's almost class time. I need you to start clearin' the hallways aright? Damn, brah, your little brother's pretty cool. What's to understand? You get a boner, slap her titties around some and then stick it inside her and pee. Well, okay, fine. Unless you don't want to get her pregnant, then you pull it out and pee on her leg. Yeah, I've got bigger things to deal with. They what??  Hang on a second: making out in the hallways is strictly against school policy! Yeah, well now it's personal! The hallways are my jurisdiction! If there's a hallway infraction going on, they're gonna have to deal with the Dawg! Hall infraction!  You got a hall pass, brah?! Yeah? Well, where's ''his'' hall pass?! Get down on the floor!  You like bear mace, icehead?! You're goin' with Christ!  ...And that's what I got, Principal brah. These two were in the hallway making out. She had those love letters on her person. Yes. During classtime, without a hall pass. I know. It's like a hall pass doesn't even matter to her. You just dealt with the Dawg, bitch! You don't owe me anything. My hallways are cleeean.  Oh no! I don't believe it. She's using the Mel Gibson defense. There you are. What are you doing? You giving up, brah?! No, they haven't left yet. Their flight is tomorrow morning. I had Beth check out their Travelocity account. Beth is my bitch. I put a whole crew together, brah. I'm gonna get that hallway-defilng slut no matter what it takes! Are you in?! Yep. We're all done with the video, let's move out!  Everyone get a good look at our fugitive! I want her taken down fast and clean!  It's okay! I'm a hallway monitor!  Keep separation! Leeroy, check out our twenty! You seen this woman, brah?  She's staying here! I am the Dawg, the big bad Dawg! Beth! Bear-mace that guy!  Let's check out the rooms! Leeroy and Kyle go that way! Beth, you come with me! I'm looking for this teacher! Is she in your room, brah?!  Keep your mouth shut, brah!! Praise Christ! Let's go!  Bear mace that guy! And that guy!  Freeze, bitch! It's all right! There's been a misunderstanding! I'm a hall monitor.  This fugitive is trying to avoid a hallway infraction by skipping off to Milan. Get down! We can do this the easy way, or we can do it Dawg-style!  Well, looks like once again, the Dawg has prevailed. I hope you've learned, kids, that if you don't go with Christ, you could end up just like that splattered bitch down on the pavement. That's cool. I'm done making my video anyways.  What's the big deal, Kyle? You just look in the mirror, and say the name three times. See? You're scared. Because you know if you say it a third time, he's gonna show up and shoot you in the face.  I've done it lots of times.  Biggie Smalls... Biggie Smalls... This is dumb, you guys, let's do somethin' else. I am not!  Oh my God. I crapped my pants.  Heheh. You guys! You guys, check it out! Dude... You know, escargot, my cargo, one eighteen, sippin' on booze at the House of Blues How do you know?? How can we be sure? How do we know Butters isn't with Biggie right now? Being tormented by him?  I'm waiting for the new Nintendo Wii to come out. Three weeks. Come ohhhn! C-Come ohhhn!  No Mom, you don't understand! I've been waiting for this thing to come out for months. And now, every day time is slowing down. It's like... waiting for Christmas... times a thousand. Noo!! Nooo!! How long until Nintendo Wii comes out now?! Oh God...  Okay, how long now?  HEHHH! I can't take it anymore! HAAAAAH! Come ohhhn! C-Come ohhhn!  Can't I just stay and... look at the sign a little longer? Oh God! Agh! That does it!! I am not waiting three weeks!! You guys! You guys! You guys, you gotta help me. I can't take it anymore, you guys. The wait for Nintendo Wii is literally killing me.  No. There ''is'' something I can do. All right, listen: you know how in space movies they put astronauts in suspender animation so that their trip seems really short, right?  I think I figured out how to do it. Freeze myself. If I freeze myself, then in three weeks, when Nintendo Wii comes out, you guys can unfreeze me. The wait will seem instantaneous to me. It's simple science, Kyle. I'll die waiting for the Wii to come out!! Don't you see this is my only chance!! I thought you were my friends! I guess I was wrong! After everything we've been through together, you guys won't even help me freeze myself!   Ey! Close the door, I'm trying to freeze!  No! No, it's too soon! Butters, get your coat. We gotta go. You're gonna help me freeze myself.  And no matter what happens, Butters, you are not to unfreeze me until the day the Nintendo Wii comes out. Do you got it?! No, it's not a good idea. It's an awesome idea All right, you got the spot figured out? You're not gonna lose where I am, right? All right, now get out of here. You can't freeze too, or else we're both screwed.  Get out of here, you asshole! You're gonna ruin everything!  Yes. Come on. Freeeze. Freeeze. Nin-ten-do. I'm coming. I'm coming, Nin-ten-do. Where am I? Safe where, butthole?!  What?? Butters? Butters, you black asshole?!  Is the Wii out? Where's the Wii? Primitive? It has motion-control controllers, asswipe! I don't care! Is there a Nintendo Wii! No...  NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!! This is terrible. Five hundred years in the future.  What??  YES!! YES!! So I'm not too late! Come on, let's go! I know I'm special. This isn't news to me.  And this gives me a Nintendo Wii how? Who?  Who are they?? Jesus Christ! I'm just a little boy from the past who wants to play Nintendo Wii. What?? Can it. You otters may have evolved to the point you can talk, but I don't need lectures.  Sure. This is Monarch land now. Probably Jarvis probes everywhere. Over here!  Sorry Blavius. I've got other plans.  I got it! I got the Wii!   Get out of my way! Here.   Come on! Come on! Dude, what is taking so long! I wanna play! There's gotta be some way to hook it up! It's the freakin' future! You've gotta be shittin' me!! Science-dammit! I am so fucking sick of the future!  I'll tell you what's wrong! I've been waiting 500 years to play the Nintendo Wii! And if I don't get to play real soon, I'm gonna bust a nut! Suck my balls, K-10. I'm not in the mood. God I hate future TV. There's too many commercials!  Tell me about it.  What? Why didn't anyone tell me there was a time phone?! Don't you see?? If I get one of those phones, I can call myself in the past and tell me not to ''freeze'' myself.  Then I can go back into my time... and play Nintendo Wii. I care! Where's the closest toy store?? Come on! Come on! Ugh, finally! I want one of those time-phone things. Yeah yeah, I'm only gonna prank-call people. Six thousand credits?! What do I look like to you? A Thurilian miner?! Look, I have to have one of those phones! How about a robot? How much for the robot?  Wait. K-10, can you access the store's sales records? I want the name and address of anybody who's bought a time phone from this guy in the past week. Hello, I'm with the cubic waste department. I need to check your lowertram for inhibitors.   Oh God!  Who is this? What?? Who the hell is this?! Me who?! What?! Oh very funny, Kyle! Yeah? Well you can go fuck yourself. Listen to this!  Butters?! Come on, we gotta go! Come on, Butters, it's gonna get dark! What??  Who the fuck is this?! Suck my balls! ...Okay, you have one minute.  Are you spying on me?! Fuck you, asshole. You can go fuck yourself!  Come on, Butters, we're going! This is terrible! I'm gonna die in the future without ever playing Nintendo Wii?! What is the Great Question? I have to get out of here! Why is everyone in my past so stupid that they think I'm crank-calling them?! Who? Garrison? But he's an asshole. It's an emergency! It's an emergency! I need to speak to Mr. Garrison right now! Look asshole, this is a real emergency! Just pass the phone to whatever Garrison wants to call himself since the sex-change operation! Mr. Garrison! Mr. Garrison!   Wait... Isn't... everybody at war over atheism? So there is no war now in the future.  And what was that purpose again? Right...  I'll miss you too, KOK-A-3. Hoowww-  I'm back. Wow! I'm back! Mom! Mom, they did it!  No, I know. You're right, Mom. I need to learn to be patient. I think I can wait three weeks for Nintendo Wii to come out. What? NO!  You sent me back too far!! HEY! Do it over! I can't wait two months!  I can't! There has to be a way around this! Hello? ...Oh, suck my balls, Kyle!  And we will all miss you, Chef,  but we know you must do what your heart tells you.. People! People, quiet, please!  We must not panic! I believe that Professor Thomas from the University has come up with a solution. We're gonna need eight dozen shovels and sixteen tons of sand! Let's move, people! Bye-bye! Well Chef, you're welcome to stay with me until you buy another house.   Well thanks, Officer Dickhole! Yeah, I just wanted to  try to set an example, you know?  Great speech! This is all Stan's fault! He wrote that gay little song and got us to ''drive'' those damned hybrids! Everyone get your hybrid and meet at Dawson's!  All right, everyone get in and get a seal on that door! How could ''Family Guy'' do that?  Everyone. Everyone, listen. FOX Network censored the image of Mohammad at the last minute. So how do we do that?  Uh Professor, we all just thought of somethin'. If everyone has their head buried by the person standing to their left, then who's gonna bury the last person's head? He's right! The turd could have been put there to cover up 9/11! The kindergarten teacher is suspected of having sex with a student Yeah. I know. Good-bye! Wow! It seems like you had a great time with the Super Adventure Club, Chef. They sound like interesting people. Hey there, Richard! Yeah. It's a hybrid. I just... I just couldn't sit back and-  be a part of destroying the earth anymore. Oho...  You know, the emissions from a vehicle like yours causes irreparable damage to the ozone. I drive a hybrid; it's much better for the environment.  Thanks. Oh yes. You've got one too, I see.  Thanks. Hold on, boys. We still have to go to the hardware store, and hand out awareness citations to SUV cars in the parking lot. Okay, there's another one.  "Ticket for driving a gas-guzzler" Look, there's a Jeep over there! Go write them a ticket, Kyle! NOW, KYLE!  Oh! Sorry Randy. Looks like you got a ticket. Yeah. I'm just, you know, trying to make people more ''aware'' ya' know, it's a- Well, Randy, calm down. It's not a real ticket. Jimbo, your truck probably gets less than ten miles to the gallon. Look, I'm just trying to make the people of South Park aware of a very serious problem. Oh! I'm sorry! I didn't think it was "high and mighty" to  care about the earth! Well, I really don't see how  that has anything to do with the- All right, that does it! Come on, Kyle, I don't want you hanging around with these ignorant idiots!  Yeah. Yeah, I think it's best we just do it right away.  Yes, it certainly is. Well, I totally agree, Kyle. Yes. A lot of people in town just aren't ready to drive hybrid cars. And that's why,  ...we've decided to MOVE! We need to be where everyone is motivated and progressive like us! Start getting your things packed, boys! The Broflovksi family is moving to San Francisco!  I'm sorry, Stan, but unfortunately you live in a small-minded town filled with ignorant boobs.   Well? What do you think, huh?  Yeah. Now THIS, is a house.  Yes that's right. We're the Broflovskis. Yeah. That's right. Wow, so, everyone here drives a hybrid, huh? Yeah. We sure are. Yeah, well, you know my son is just  a little bit more clever than some. Hey there. Alan, right? Right right, w-would, would you like red or white wine? Oh. Sure.  Everything okay in here, Kyle? So much better here with the intellectuals, isn't it, boys?  Mmmm.  We don't know. We were all passed out and... next thing we know we just woke up on a bus heading here. And let's make sure nobody gets a stupid hybrid, right?  I don't think I can do it either. Come on, everybody! Let's go buy wasteful gas guzzlers!   Which cartoon is it? What cartoon'll be so insensitive as to have Mohammad as a character?  It's okay... it's dead. Kyle! Kyle, wake up!  We have to go! The terrorists are attacking! This isn't a joke, Kyle! Bombs have already gone off in six cities!  He was just here! Ike! Yeah. The sand thing sounds a lot simpler.  So long! He's right.  Well from now on, I'm only going to associate with other hybrid-car drivers. Everyone else is just ignorant, m'kay? It's like you had a guardian angel, m'kay?  But hybrid cars are the leading cause of smug, m'kay? It's simply asking too much. Wu-we've got the TV working!   Attention students: Proceed to the school gymnasium immediately for an emergency announcement! Retaliation... Oh my God. M'kay? Yeah, me too. M'kay, students, we have a very special guest speaker today. Who can tell me the name of our country's last vice-president? No, the last one. No, Clinton's ''vice''-president.   Uhhh, ohhhkay, thank you Mr. Gore. Mrs. Cartman, we have had it with your son's behavior, mkay?! Little Billy Turner is now being treated at the hospital! You know that's not the point! We have tried at this school to make Eric understand that there are boundaries, mkay?! But frankly, we believe his behavioral problems start at home! Mrs. Cartman, I know this is extremely difficult but, there is help out there for people like you. Have you ever heard of a show called ''Nanny 911?''  And some jokester took a poop in it! Okay? Now I want whoever did it to come forward right now, and it will be less painful for everybody! M'kay?! Excuse me!! Could we get back to the issue, please?! You all don't seem to understand how serious this is!! Now who made dookie in the urinal?!  Oh, you think it's funny, huh?! M'kay! M'kay! You're gonna think it's real funny when the police get here! But there must have been some motive. Nobody would just dook in the urinal for no reason.  Look, what-ever you believe, the fact of the matter is somebody... dropped a dookie in the school urinal, and there's still no explanation for that! More important?! You aren't the one, who had to walk into the boys' bathroom, okay, after having tuh, to wake up early, you know, there's no, no coffee in the teachers' lounge, and then you, you walk into the bathroom just to find a big dook laying there in the urinal! Like it's laughin' at you! No, I'm not saying they're related! Oh no, not the Goddamned- Now you might all think I've given up finding out who crapped in the urinal. M'kay? And maybe, maybe you think it's a victimless crime. This, is Mr. Venezuela  Oh, you think it's funny, huh?! Huh? Why, Clyde? Why did you do it? You got a whole school here, Clyde! M'kay? You got over three hundred people that need to use the boys' room.  M'kay, that's good!  Come on in, please. I'm just trying to get your son to explain why... he would drop a dook in the urinal! Attention students. Apparently, Clyde could not have been the one who crapped in the urinal, because Clyde had a colostomy at age 5. 'Kay? Now, whoever did this unspeakable act is still at large. The boys' bathroom is closed until further notice, 'cause one of you thought it would be a good idea... to pull down your pants... m'kay, hover your buttcheeks over the urinal... and squeeze out a chocolate hot dog... m'kay?  When you dook in the urinal, it's bad, m'kay!  Oh you think that's funny, huh?! Yeah, that's real funny! You need to watch for bad behavior, and make sure anyone in the halls during class has a hall pass. M'kay?  Now Eric, being the school hallway monitor is a big responsibility. M'kay? It is important that you take the job seriously, and that you don't abuse the power. M, m'kay. Ya-you realize evolution has been pretty much uhhh... proven. So long Chef! Good-bye, Chef! Good-bye, Chef! Have a good time at the Super Adventure Club! Oh, finally!  Ohhh, so have you decided you can still belong to the Super Adventure Club but live here in South Park again? Well, it seems like the Super Adventure Club was just what you needed, Chef. You must be feeling very happy that you found a club to belong to with new friends, but that you can also live here in South Park with all your old friends whom you care for deeply.  Right? Well, come on everybody. I'm sure Chef would like a little time to get moved back in. Yeah. What's this?  A ticket? "Failure to care about the environment" Oh Goddammit, did you do this, Gerald?! You got some nerve, you know that?! Where do you come off ticketing people?! I know it's not a real ticket!! The problem, Gerald, is that ever since you got a hybrid car, you've gotten so smug that you love the smell of your own farts! And that too! Stop talking with your eyes closed! That's what smug people do! There, like that! Stop that! I know! It's like "Earth to America? Hello? This is simple stuff here. Gawl".  At least ''we're'' smart enough to know better! Are you trying to tell us the smug from our hybrids is actually gonna kill us all? Yeah. Good going, stupid! Hey, where do you think YOU're going?! Oh no you're not! Your gay little song got us to drive hybrids; you're gonna help us get rid of 'em! That's it. That's that the last one. I'm sorry, Stan. I'm sorry your gay little song killed your friend. Yeah. First off, we're all gonna need new cars. You mean... drive in hybrids... but not act like we're better than everyone else because of it. I'm...  I'm not ready... Perhaps... one day... we can learn to drive hybrids without being smug about it, but for now... the technology is just too much for us. STAAAN!! Get up! Get your shoes on! Gotta get out of here! MOOVE!  Shelly, go get my gun!! JUST GET THE GUN!!  Unh, come on!  A cartoon...! A cartoon is about to air on American television with... with the Muslim prophet Mohammad as a character!  SO?! Stanley, Mohammad is sacred to the Muslim people.  Ever since those cartoons in Denmark, the rules have changed. Nobody shows an image of Mohammad anymore. Who do you think?! The cartoon that's always pushing buttons with their careless toilet humor! ''Family Guy''! Because ''Family Guy'' doesn't care who they insult! They only care about their... ''precious money!'' We stay here through the night, wait it out to see if they do anything. If we're still alive in the morning,  then we'll know we're not dead. We're alive?? We're alive!  Well, it looks like we've dodged a bullet.  I DAMN YOU TO HELL!!! Well what are we gonna do, Mayor?! Part 2 of the ''Family Guy'' episode airs in six days! I like the sand idea. It's the best say, Stanley. Did you eat your Fruit Roll-Up? All right, make sure your snorkel is working.  All right, now get your head in the hole. Stanley, there's no time for your immaturity! Do it!   Uhh, Stan?  It's ah, getting late, boys. Why don't you get in the car and I'll drive you all home? Boys, I don't want you hanging out with that ex vice-president anymore, okay? ManBearPig? Boys, there's no such thing as a ManBearPig. The vice president is just desperate for attention.  Stan? Stan!  You've been on your computer all weekend. Shouldn't you go out and socialize with your friends?  Not now, Nelson. I just joined a big party of night elves and we're gonna explore the Tower of Azora together. No, r-tard, it's an MMORPG. These are real people I'm playing with. See, I'm a hunter, level 2.  What?? Why?? Why?! Hey, Stan, can I play with you guys?  Yeah, I'm playing from the office. Yes? That's my son's character's name in Warcraft. Who are you?  Stan?! Stan!  Sharon, where is Stan?! Where?! Sharon, his character is going to die if we don't get to him! Give me the sword. I have a Warcraft character. I'm a newb, but I can log on and get the sword to Stan online. Sounds to me like we don't have a choice! Give me the sword.  Where's your car? Dammit, mine's in the shop!  Nelson! Nelson, I need to come over and use your computer! No, I d-I need to play World of Warcraft! NELSON! World of Warcraft! I need to play! Got to...sign in...character name...All right, I'm in!  Staaan!  Stan! I've been sent here...to bring you this.  This sword can completely drain his mana. No time! Just take it! Here!  ...How, how do you hand something from one player to another? Okay.  Augh! Stan...   I've never been able to say this before, but...I love you, son.  Augh! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...   Godspeed.  What's goin' on? With a student? But... she's a woman. But... she's hot. Yeah, she's a hot victim.   What?  Biggie Smalls?  All right, boys, I know it's Halloween, but you can't summon dead rappers in the mirror. I'm a geologist!  ...Smalls.  No way! That's pretty cool. Hey, Hey Sharon! Your mother's been worried sick, and I've been watching TV! Oh, well that's good. ...What? With the-?  What whoa wait, Stan. You gave up playing hockey a long time ago. Have you forgotten what happened all those years ago? Or are you just trying to make up for it? Your Pee Wee hockey game! The Pepsi Center?! In between periods of the Colorado Avalanche? Stan, you can't put your family through this again! Whatever your reasons are! What are we goin' to do, Sharon?? Don't you get it? He's getting back into hockey to ''prove'' something to himself. So he can forget what happened in that Pee Wee skirmish. Oho, he remembers. I'm sure it eats at him every single day.   NOOOOOOOOOOO! OH! Ohh... Oh Sharon, it was horrible! It was like I was living it all over again. Can you believe it, Stan? The Pepsi Center. You're going back to the place where it all happened. Same place where you missed that shot all those years ago. Ya have to understand why I can't go. I can't... sit there in that same crowd and watch you destroy yourself again.  NOOO! NOT AGAIN! NOOO!  What? All right! Yeah!  Later. Great to have you back. Bye-bye. See ya Chef. See you later. Bye-bye. ''(muffled)'' Yeah, me too. ''(muffled)'' Like what? ''(muffled)'' Yeah! I think... ''(muffled)'' Chef!  (Like what?) (Yeah, I don't get it.) (Hello!) (What are we gonna do??) (Oh, no kidding.) (No, nothing!)  (Yeah, No shit.) (We're almost there!) (Fuck you.)  (I think Kyle has sweet titties, hahahaha) (Me too.) (Woohoo! Oh man!) (Reaaly??) (What?)  It's really weird what he said, I don't know, it kind of confused me. Something's wrong with Chef. He's saying some really weird stuff. I think... I think he wants to have sex with me. I gotta- I gotta go.  Kyle, the person leaving. Kyle's not here. Cartman didn't invite him. Hey! Hey, Stan! You're not gonna believe it! You've gotta come see! It's a miracle! Are you guys dumb? We can't beat him, even with all of us. It's a waste of time. I've got better things to do.  I'm just gonna stop playing. No. All right all right, I'll do it! Whoa... I don't know.  Hey Chef. Yay! Chef! Chef!  Hi kids, I'm Detective Jarvis. I need to ask you all some difficult questions about your school cafeteria chef. We have some information that all this time Chef has been and still is a pedophile.  Uh huh.  Yeah, yeah he is so. Now, we need some testimony in order to arrest Chef,  Ok, did he touch you here?     Young man, will you PLEASE pay attention! This is very important stuff! Ohhh. Ohhhhhh. What's a pedophile? My Uncle Bud did that to me once!  Uh hay, Stan. Uh you should come on over. Uh they're havin' a goin'-away party for Kyle. Well don't you know? Kyle's movin' away. Well he is. At Cartman's house. Yeah! I'm a dumb Jew.   Well I'm sorry. Well it's just that I'm not Jewish, and now th- Wow, Eric. You sure are a great guy for doing this. But... how come we can't just take the bus on into the city?  I will. You're really great for going to warn Kyle, Eric.  I'm here, Eric.  You must be nearing Union Square. Did you see a fountain to your left? Wait, uhh, eh take your next right. You've got to start heading west. That's it! Eric, hurry! Somethin's goin' on out here! Bill Clinton.  No, my parents won't let me bring homeless people home anymore.  Whoopie! G and R Railroad! Kill your mom? I don't play World of Warcraft. Yeah, but I'm playing Hello Kitty Island Adventure. O-oh, o-oh, a-alright. All right then. Hey fellas!  Boy, this is neato, huh? I got World of Warcraft, like you said. Well, there's only like four races to choose from-  I like Hello Kitty Island Adventure a lot more 'n this stuff. What's a urinal? Hey, fellas! Well, I heard that 9/11 was caused by President Bush.  From Eric. Well, l-uh, I mean, uh, you never know. Uh, the government does some pretty spooky things. The government and the corporations headed by the Jews that tear down 9/11. Can I go now? Waaaah!  Hey there, Mr. Wiener, whattaya know? Do ya need to tinkle tinkle?  Yes I do think so.  Haaaah!  Huh? Uhh, okay.  I do.   Ehthat was pretty good. Then do it, if you're not yellow!  That's why I like to brush my teeth; I know they're clean and white. All the  AAAAH!   I summoned Biggie Smalls, the hip-hop rapper! But Dad, he's gonna bust a cap in my ass! AAAAAAAAAAH!  Haaaah. P-please don't ice me, homie? I just... w-was seein' if it works.  I Iii, I apologize, Mr. Smalls. W-what party? Uh whah well can't you just take a plane? Well damn, ni**er, there's gotta be ''some'' way! Oh hamburgers! <poem><i>I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali. Uhh, yeah, I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali. Uhh-</i></poem> Yo dawg, uh, can't I just go back home right after the flight so I don't get grounded? Uhh, excuse me. uh ma'am, can I borrow that?  Thanks.  Sure, homie. I got your back, yo. Wull what the heck? I'm gonna get grounded anyway, might as well.  Oh boy! Go where?  Well, how come we've gotta come all the way out here? Eric, are you sure this is a good idea?  Yeah...I guess it is... I got it.  Big Tree. Oval Rock. Oh jeez!  Quick, General Disarray! Kill those superheroes! Yes! Now the world shall feel the wrath of Professor Chaos! Hahaha!  Who, me?  No ma'am. Geh-General Disarray, can I ask you a scientific question? Well, um, can... Can anything bad happen if you completely freeze yourself and then unfreeze yourself three weeks later? Well, like what? ...Die?? Oh hamburgers!!  Eric! Eric! He told me to! Wait!  It's all different. Nothing's in the same place!  Uh, eh, Eric! Eric! What?? But I just did what he told me! Oh, jumping Jesus!  Hello?  Eric? Is that you?  Eric, are you playing a joke on me again? But...  Huh?? But, you're telling me not to go with you. Oh, all right then. NO! May I help you? Right this way.  Excuse me, sir. These boys wanted to speak with you. Mr. Rivera. Now, the upper rim of Kilimanjaro should be quite a trek, and so we'll need to have a- Ahh yes, splendid! Good afternoon, lads! I'm Head Adventurer William P. Connolly, Esquire! Welcome, to the Super Adventure Club! Tally ho! Indeed! What? Well... well yes, of course! That's what the Super Adventure Club does! Noo, no, that's the Adventure Club. We're the Super Adventure Club!  Next week, we'll be heading to the outer banks of the Amazon, where we will make camp and have sex with children of the Ugani tribe, then it's off to the mighty Himalayas, where we will climb K-2, and molest several Tibetan children on the east summit. I know, but it gets even better! From there we will kayak to the fruitful banks of the Mele River in Africa, where the secret and mysterious Hanimi people have children who have never seen a white man's erect penis. Of course, we're always looking for kids to have sex with on the plane rides over to these places, so how would you ALL like to join the Super Adventure Club! No? Oh really? Perhaps I should ask you again?   Well, so long then. What? What thing? I don't see anything.  He's safe.  He's fasting in the Deprivation Room and being read the Super Adventure Club manual. We've got to undo the damage you've done. We don't need him, he needs us! Our club offers hope. Do you think we go around the world molesting children just because it feels really really really really good?! No! Our club has a message! And a secret that explains the mysteries of life! Very well. I'm now going to tell you the secret of the Super Adventure Club. You see, the Super Adventure Club was founded by the greatest explorer of all time, William P. Phinehas!  But now the most wonderful part. You see, after having sex with all those children, Phinehas realized that... molesting all those kids... had made him immortal. He discovered that children have things called marlocks in their bodies.  Is it any more retarded than the idea of God sending his son to die for our sins? Is it any more retarded than Buddha sitting beneath a tree for twenty years? Well, now that you know our club secrets, it appears you ... leave us no choice. I'm afraid we're going to have to... ask you to leave.  If you choose not to leave, then I'm afraid we're just going to have to ... call security and make you leave.  Okay, you know how like, when you want people to leave but they won't leave, it's really frustrating? Cool people leave before they've overstayed their welcome.  Take these boys to the door.  Haha! Look they're being led by security! Haha!  What the-? Impossible! I made them leave! Stop them!  Stop!   You sought adventure! And why do people seek adventure? Because their lives have become dull and empty! Don't forget all your training, Chef! Stay with us and your life will be GRAND and ETERNAL! Yesss. Looks like our fruity little club is safe after all.  We can't lose another member! Shoot it!  Pity. He would have made an excellent child molester.  Is it working? Is it working? Get him in the ICU suit! Hurry!  Chef, can you hear me? Say something. Yes, go on. Oh? You mean like chocolate candy? Yes, YES! Hahahahahahaaa! We travel around the world and have sex with children! All right, this!  Yes, what else would we do?  Oh my God! Oh nooo!   Mr. President, we need your final approval code. Mr. President, we need final authorization! Mr. President, we're awaiting your orders! Mr. President, thirty seconds to airtime. What do you want us to do?! Five seconds, Mr. President!  Mr. President, we need a decision now! Air it!  Burn him! Burn the towel! Take a picture of the sound, Steven.  They killed him! We can come out! My monvert's never looked so clean.  We are the Browns. Nelson's parents? Mr. Chef, is it? Hello, I'm Dr. Neeland. What can I do for you today?  Brainwashed? I thought that club was for hiking and kayaking. Oh. ...Oh, that's right, yeah. Why, yes, I have two young boys. You say he's never been like this before? He's pretty brainwashed all right. Worst case I've ever seen. I'm afraid there's no simple answer. When somebody's brainwashed it can take months, even years, to reverse the process. Tell me, what was Chef's favorite thing to do before it was having sex with children? Then that's it. We'd better get your friend to the Peppermint Hippo right away. WEll let's...give it some time, kids.  No-no wait. Let him go.  All right guys. be sure to tip the waitresses; this is two for one; put your hands together, this is Monique! All right guys, help me feel it out to them; we got a featured dancer coming out next; put your hands together for... Spantaneous Bootay!  All right, all you dreamers and creamers out there out there in South Park, I'm gonna play a song by a local artist that really made me think about my impact on the earth. This is Stan Marsh with "Hey, People, You've Gotta Drive Hybrids Already".   Would you like to daaance???  Daaance??? Anybody wanna daaance??? Up yours, fatty.  All right, come on kids. This is their house and they don't want you here.  And sex with Eskimo children requires some special skills.  Get out of here! Yes. We've got a pulse! Hello there, children. How would you like some Salisbury Steak? And for desert, how would you children like to suck on my chocolate salty balls? No, I mean my balls.  Oh, hey Gerald. New car? Well... Good for you. If only the rest of the country  was as insightful as we are. So I guess there's nothing left to do now but... rebuild. Who else could it have been? Well, there goes the new high-and-mighty Gerald Broflovski. Then that's it. There's only one way to reduce smugness. We've gotta destroy every hybrid car in town!  We can't go back out, Linda! It's too late for him! No, no, wait a minute,  Butters! We told you to be in bed! What are you doing?! You had a nightmare! Turn around and get back in your room right now! Well, you wanna get shot or you wanna be grounded?!  ...Honestly, why do let him watch that darn Black Entertainment Channel? Hey, is that a hybrid? Yeah, I like to be a part of the solution and not part of the problem. Well, anyway, ''[sticks his thumb up through the passenger window] good for you!'' This your bike? It's on the impound list. You owe the county for tickets.  Yeah? Well my job is to tow this bike. You want it back? You talk to the county.  Who the hell put this faggy fake ticket on my truck! Take offense.  Alienated. I want three. I'm totally tripping balls. I'm totally tripping balls. Ice cream. And chocolate.  Nooooo!  I'm gonna poop on my pants. Aah Kyle!  I don't like Mason.  Ike made a nuno. Oh.  Ring around the rosey.  Nonono, nononono.  No, no. Spider-Man! I'm safe, Mom. Weohhh part ten. Mom-my I love you I love you. I like dada better. You are dead to me! I said, you're dead to me!  You're dead to me, Kyle! Miss Stephenson  Yaaaaaaaaaaaaay, Mulan! I love TV. Yaaay! Oh no! I don deser futty bad man. Yaaaay!  Hey Eric, where's Kyle? Hey yeah!  Okay.  That's it, I'm dead! Dude, a going-away party is supposed to be ''for the person who is going away''! ...But I hate you. He killed ''my'' character right in the middle of a quest! Got it. Oh Gerald, it's beautiful. Oh it's gorgeous. These old houses are so neat. No! Hello, how are you? Why would ''Family Guy'' so blatantly insult Muslims? Kyle? Kyle, what are you watching?! Gaaah! It's ''Family Guy''! Quick, Gerald, do something!  You boys know you're not supposed to watch that careless show! You boys don't understand anything! It's obvious that you ALL need Muslim-sensitivity training! Wait a minute!  Where's Ike?! Ike!  Hello bubbe, how was school today? Oh, come on, school isn't all that bad. Whatwhatwhaaat?! We have to do something! It is obvious our children are still completely confused about 9/11! Mr. Mackey, there are more important things going on here!  Kyle, I need you to go get your brother over at his teacher's house. Tell his teacher I'm sorry, but I forgot he has a doctor's appointment today. He's been going there in the afternoons for private tutoring. Miss Stevenson? Yes. She's very nice. That's great. Yes, Ike, you like Spider-Man, don't you? Mommy loves you too, sweetie. Sex? Oh bubbe, Ike is much too young.   Help! Please, I need your help! That teacher, Miss Stevenson, she, she left town with my son! I got a note saying they're going to Milan! No, it's true! This is serious! Are you going to do nothing?! Oh hello there, you must be the new neighbors. Welcome to San Francisco. I'm Peter Thompson. This is my wife, Nancy Jarvis, and our son, Brian Thompson-Jarvis  So how do you like the neighborhood? Yeah, it's like, San Francisco is more of a European city, like Paris or Milan. AWWWGH! Take cover in the community center again!  It doesn't surprise me. More and more people are being blamed for 9/11 every day. Do you gentlemen need a hand?  I'll get it, darling.  Hello? Hello? I'm sorry, there's no Mr. Wall here. Nno, there are no Walls here. Oh, I see! Is this the Johnson boys from down the street?! Very funny! God darn ya!  Let them play! Yes, well, unlike most cities, in San Francisco we try to  keep all the historic houses instead of knocking them down. Oh hay, Paul. Come on in and meet the Broflovskis Whoa, nice car, but we're gonna have to get you into the BT series  Its emissions are actually cleaner. Oh, of course. We're a little more progressive and ahead of the curve here in San Francisco.  Anyway, I'm sure you'll find it much better here. You think ''that's'' bad? Remember when I auditioned to be David Hasselhoff's car?  Nervous? Like when I had to sell pancakes to the school soccer captain?  Well, maybe we can just have tea. Oh boy, was ''that'' ever weird. Anyway, I can't believe I invited my old sweetheart to dinner. Huh. Hey Brian, this is like the time I got a job as a carrot cake. You think ''that's'' bad? Remember the time I won a date to Mexico with Gary Coleman? You think ''that's'' bad? Remember the time I got a salmon helmet from Mohammad while wearing a toga?  Wow, a salmon helmet! Thanks!  Anyway, what were we talking about? Oh yeah, my pink slip. Or the time I-   You in here, Peter? Yeah. They did it! Ogh!  Nissse Hello there. I'm Paul McDonahue. This is my wife, Paulie Beaumont-McCallahan, and our daughter, Mindy McDonahue-Beaumont-McCallahan We noticed your hybrid out front - that's a V series, right? Yes, you'll find that San Francisco is pretty much more open-minded and grown-up than the Midwest.  We're just a little bit more protective of our environment here in San Francisco Sheila, did you meet Gail and Brian? Hello. He's right.  Hey Jimbo, you got a hybrid too? Yeah, I guess it's up to us to  Good for you.  Good for you!  Thanks!  And so we are here to honor Stan Marsh for making South Park the city with the highest percentage of hybrid owners ''in the country''!   Hello there, I'm Ranger McFriendly. I'm the person who watches over the delicate ecosystem of South Park. You must be the little boy who wrote that song. Uhh!  You son of a bitch! Do you have any idea what you've done?! Come with me!  There! Look!  Don't you get it?! When people drive hybrid cars, they get so full of themselves they spew tons of self-satisfied garbage into the air! That isn't smog, it's smug! Hybrid cars make better for emission levels, but people who drive hybrid cars are the leading cause of smug. You can have smug in the atmosphere, and you know what that leads to? Glodal laming! Thanks to your gay little song, South Park is now the second smuggiest city in America!  Marsh! You'd better come with me to the news station! Our situation just got a lot worse! We've got to tell the townspeople! South Park still has a chance to make it through the storm! Soo, that's it people.  When the smug from George Clooney's speech hits the San Francisco and South Park smug, we're gonna witness a storm the likes of which we've never seen. If the smug clouds remain the way they are, yes.  Listen! Though we all agree this is Stan's fault, there is still something we can do. If we all work together to reduce smugness, we might be able to lessen the effects of the storm, at least here in our own town. How long do we have until the smug clouds collide? All right. All right, now get it into the masher! Hurry up! Well then you shouldn't have written that gay little song, shouldn't you have?!  Keenan, we've gotten rid of half the hybrid cars! How are the smug levels?! Keenan? Keenan, we've smashed the last hybrid! This is a South Park News Weather Bulletin! Next week on South Park: The race continues. Cartman reaches the ''Family Guy'' Studio and learns the shocking secret behind the ''Family Guy'' writing staff. As an entire nation buries its head in sand...  ...and the battle between Good and Evil is finally waged... Will the cartoon be allowed to appear uncensored? Will ''Family Guy'' be destroyed??? Will television executives fight for free speech? Or will Comedy Central puss out? Tune in to see Part 2 of ''Family Guy'', next week, on South Park! Previously on South Park... And now, the thrilling conclusion of... Cartoon Wars... will not be seen tonight!  This is ''Larry King Live''. They're every parent's worst nightmare.  Kids completely out of control.  It's time to call Nanny 911.  Tonight... This eight year old son of a single parent just won't behave. And Nanny Stella is selected to set him straight.  Coming up next, it's Super Nanny! Where other nannies fail, Nanny Jo comes through.  When good dogs go bad, there's one man who's their best friend. Cesar Millan. And now, back to the Dog Whisperer. With new Glade monvert cleaner, you can make your monvert sparkle like never before. New, from Blasbro, it's Crank Prank Time Phone! Crank Prank Time Phone comes with debilibrator , antimatter fusion cone, and 30 plain HF watt triggers. Warning: Crank Prank Time Phone is for entertainment purposes only. Making anything OTHER than crank calls to the past could affect the present and end your existence. Crank Prank Time Phone is not intended for the use by otters. And we're about out of time here in another scoreless Pee Wee hockey game.  Oh, it appears the goalie has pooped his pants.  Oh and look at this! Little Stan Marsh actually has a shot at the goal! Time is running out. Stan Marsh with a chance to win! Ohoooo, that's the end of the game! How disappointing.  Welcome, parents, to this Pee Wee hockey match between Park County and Adams County.  And that's the end of the game. The result is a tie. His shot is blocked! What a great save!  And now please put your hands together for three minutes of exhibition play from some of our state's finest Pee Wee hockey players. It's a tie game here in Colorado as we get set to start the final period. Your attention, please: for this third and final period, the Detroit Red Wings will be playing... the Park County Pee Wee Hockey Team. It looks like we have a smug alert here in South Park. Our own Keenan Williams has the details. Keenan?  All those hybrid cars on the road have caused heavy smug to develop over most of Park and Jefferson Counties. On the national map, we can see smug over Denver and developing smug in Los Angeles. However, San Francisco is once again the smuggiest city in the country. I noticed it on the computer this morning. Look here.  This is the smug over South Park. It's... getting bigger and gaining strength. The smug is getting so massive that it's moving west... and fusing with the San Francisco smug... Here.  It's the smug from George Clooney's acceptance speech at the Academy Awards. Did you hear it? He talked about how people in Hollywood are ahead of the curve on social mattes. He even took credit for the Civil Rights movement -Look!! The point is... the smug from his acceptance speech has been slowly drifting north since he gave it... and is headed straight for the super cell. The South Park and San Francisco smug is already at critical mass. If it gets hit by George Clooney's acceptance speech, it will be a disaster of epic proportions. The perfect storm... of self-satisfaction.  Kid, thanks to your gay little song, there's not gonna be a San Francisco. Not long. The smug from George Clooney's Academy Awards Acceptance Speech has already crossed into Arizona. They're dropping, slowly, but... but we're running out of time! Harry, the smug from Clooney's speech is about to hit the other smug system! Get everyone inside!  God help us. ''A smuggy day in San Francisco town.'' Really good, really good.  Actually, it's Alain. Can I just get an empty glass? Can you believe all these imbeciles in Texas? They just put another prisoner to death.  We drink and take drugs. It's the only thing that allows us to deal with our parents all walking around loving the smell of their own farts all the time. You mean like the time you had tea with Mohammad, the prophet of the Muslim faith?  Do you want some acid? Agh! I'm so bored. Huh? Wow! Someone from the past is on the line!  You will. There's a reason most San Francisco kids take a lot of drugs. There's nothing to do. Uh hi. It's the year 1973, right? Could I speak to Al Coholic, please?  The hell is that?  And now, the worst appears to be over. Last night's smug storm... has left thousands homeless. All across the Midwest, people are picking up the pieces. Cities like Denver and South Park are heavily damaged, but still all right. However, San Francisco, I'm afraid... has disappeared completely up its own asshole. But the Bubble Gum Prince wasn't afraid. He knew that the Land of Chocolate was safe forever and ever.  Oh Randy, hold me.  I don't know. He took his computer somewhere to play that stupid online game. I ''don't know''. So what? Stanley, where have you been?! It's almost bedtime! What kind of job? What? Maybe he doesn't remember. He was only 4. Randy, what's wrong?? What's going on dad? Oh my God, Stephen, we've left Butters.  So what happens now? He just said something about... summoning Biggie Smalls...  Butters?  Butters, you haven't seen Eric Cartman in the past few days, have you? It's very important, Butters. He's missing. You haven't seen or heard from him? Okay.  AWWW! Oh thank God. Ohhhh! Once again, a cartoon depicting the Muslim prophet Mohammad is set to air tonight on ''Family Guy''! The news has already sparked a shockwave of protests throughout the Muslim world.  All over the Middle East, Muslims are burning American flags and ''Family Guy'' posters. Muslim terrorist al-Zawahri made this statement:  We are so super pissed off at 'Family Guy'. 'Family Guy' isn't even that funny of a show. A jihad on 'Family Guy', and the 'Family Guy' nation!  Seriously, 'Family Guy' isn't even that well written. The jokes are all interchangeable and usually irrelevant to the plot. When this episode airs-our retaliation will be MASSIVE!!!! Peter, I can't believe you invited your old high-school sweetheart over for dinner. But Peter, I don't wanna cook dinner for your ex-girlfriend. Peter, you didn't do the laundry today. Peter! You got a pink slip at work? Hey there, Knight Rider.   Pancakes for you, Captain? ''Love will keep us together'' Come on, Mohammad, let's get some tea.  After those bad guys, KITT!  Yeah, but Dad, why would you invite an ex-girlfriend to dinner?  I know. I'm ''swamped''. I've got no help here! The new waiter is useless. And, I think he's high.  I know. I'm ''swamped''. I've got no help here! The new waiter is useless. And, I think he's high. Perhaps he wants to make our mother nervous. I'll be the Captain, and you'll be Tenille.  Try my "Mr. T. ...tea."   ...yeah. Shh! Quiet, students, quiet! Yes, we need to go over it again in the classroom so they understand what really happened. Mr. Mackey, Clyde's parents are here. Eric Cartman, report to the principal's office immediately. Come on in, Eric.  Eric, the reason we called you in here is because it is ''your'' turn to be the school hallway monitor.  If anyone doesn't, you have the authority to bring them to me. "Ike, I long to feel your arms around me"?? Miss Stevenson, you- you're having a relationship with this student? This is unbelievable. Miss Stevenson, I ''will'' need to inform the police. Mrs. Garrison, evolution is in the school curriculum. We have to teach it. Our students want to learn, Mrs. Garrison, and they're mature enough to handle anything. Mr. Triscotti, I wasn't aware that- Sir, if you don't wish your daughter to learn about evolution, then we can pull her out of class. It has become obvious to me that you don't know enough about evolution to teach it! I'm having you replaced! Mr. Dawkins!  Richard Dawkins is a world-renowned evolutionary scientist. You are to sit in class and help Mr. Dawkins with whatever he needs! Mrs. Garrison, I am pulling you out of the classroom. Very well. But there is to be no more throwing of feces. Understood?? Once again, we have just learned that the ''Family Guy'' episode featuring Mohammad was only Part 1 of a two-parter! And Part 2 is going to air next week, with Mohammad uncensored! FOX Studios claims that the ''Family Guy'' writing staff has demanded the Mohammad character be seen in full view.  The head of FOX had this to say: Once again, bitter riots have started in the Middle East; this time, even more massive. And terrorist leader al-Zawahri has issued a threat. The idea has swept the nation! But where will we find enough sand for everyone? The popular cartoon, ''Family Guy'', is going to show the image of Mohammad uncensored! ...starting in a small town in central Colorado. The idea has now spread all over America.  Amd Muslim terrorists continue to make threats. Osama bin Laden had this to say: Bin Laden went on to say that if ''Family Guy'' shows the image of Mohammad as planned, the terrorist retaliation will be immediate.  As soon as the image of Mohammad appeared, terrorist leader al-Zawahri announced the retaliation! ''Family Guy'' is our biggest show. If they insist we don't censor their work, then we we can't. Yes, Mr. President. Mr. President, my hands are tied. The ''Family Guy'' writers insist I don't censor Mohammad. Mr. President, there's something about the ''Family Guy'' writing staff I think you should know.  Mr. President, there's something about the ''Family Guy'' writing staff I think you should know.  Okay, let's discuss the fall lineup. All right, let's get this over with.  I feel terrible. It's so easy to put terrorism out of mind until one of its victims is staring you in the face. Little boy, will ''you'' talk to the ''Family Guy'' writing staff? If your story touches their hearts like it has ours, perhaps they'll back down from demanding we air the episode. Take this noble child over to the ''Family Guy'' offices. If he can scare them like he has us, maybe we ''can'' pull the Mohammad episode after all. What was that? I don't understand it. What's wrong with them?   But, nobody took any idea balls out of the tank, did they? Then why are they refusing to write? I agreed to show Mohammad uncensored! I did what you asked! WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME??!! You're right. It's time I stop letting these primadonna manatees tell me what to do! I'm pulling the Mohammad episode, you got that?! And if you all don't want to work tomorrow, you can just find other jobs!!  How long before ''Family Guy's'' supposed to air?! I gotta hurry!  Network Control! This is the President! I want you to pull the episode. I'm sure. Begin episode jettison sequence 0 2 900.  President approval code  0-0-destruct- Who are you? The end of ''Family Guy''? Hold on, Julie!  What are you talking about, kid? You mean... the manatees aren't trying to run the network? Ah... I don't know who to listen to! Okay, I'll listen to you.  Julie? But he has a gun. I can't be responsible for people getting hurt. Especially me. I shouldn't even be in the office still. It's supposed to be half-day Friday. How about I allow the episode to air but, just censor out the image of Mohammad again. ''Family Guy'' goes on air as planned. Uncensored.  Now look, everyone, Muslim terrorists and extremists are threatening us for what ''Family Guy'' is going to do... because they've wrongly grouped us together. Our only hope is to make the Muslim extremists know... that we had no part in the Mohammad episode. That even though the episode aired, we didn't watch it, we didn't hear it, and we didn't talk about it. We bury our heads. In sand.  We take twenty to twenty-five dump trucks, fill them with sand from Monarch Lake, and then dump the sand along South Park Avenue. By using approximately eighteen dozen shovels, we can each dig a hole in the sand, stick our heads in the holes, and then have the person to our left bury them. If we can manage to get every person's head buried deep, deep in sand before the Mohammad episode airs, we could avoid looking like we're responsible for any part of this at all. If you have children, be sure to bury their heads in the sand before you bury your own.  Yes. I'm afraid one person is going to have to be last, and... not have his head in the sand. You realize by not burying your head in sand, you'll appear to be a part of the ''Family Guy'' audience. If we all bury our heads in sand,  we can avoid being any part of this. Stay on 'em!   I'll do it.  Dylan, no! Dylan, please, you can't! Yes, I know. Somebody has to do it, Sarah.  Are you the network president? We need to discuss this ''Family Guy'' episode, Mr. President. But Mr. President, this is a matter of national security. They must be reasoned with. I want to assure the American people that as President, I have exhausted every possible solution. Unfortunately, Mohammad will appear uncensored on ''Family Guy'' tonight at seven. I have come to... understand something about the ''Family Guy'' writing staff. Suffice it to say that they will ''not be persuaded'' by the possibility of violence.  I'm afraid that information is classified. Look! The fact of the matter is the ''Family Guy'' writing staff is protected by something called the First Amendment!  Uh you know, the right to free speech.  Well... We didn't come up with the First Amendment. It was already in place. Hey, that wasn't bad at all. They just showed Mohammad standin' there, lookin' normal. What?!  Say Terrance, isn't it wonderful having a holiday here at the Lazy "J" Ranch? Oh, look who's coming! Isn't that Mohammad, the holy prophet of the Muslim religion?  You censored out the image of Mohammad in our television special!! We demand you rerun ''Mystery at the Lazy "J" Ranch'' with Mohammad uncensored! It sure is, Phillip. But I do believe this steer I'm riding has the farts.  Hello Mohammad, we've read all aboat you in the Koran. ALL RIGHT, JUST WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE??!! But you ruined the whole show! But ''Family Guy'' is going to show Mohammad on an episode that airs tonight! Hey guys, how's it going? I'm here to investigate a murder. Ey! You guys know the rules! Nobody can show the image of Mohammad anymore. It's dangerous. Look, I'm not gonna risk the lives of the people at this network. Let's just forget aboat it, okay guys?  Aw, come on guys, give me a break. Ey! I run this network, not you guys! And if you ask me, your show has become so preachy and full of messages that you've forgotten how to be funny! NO Mohammad! I doubt it! I'll bet that right now, somebody is on their way to FOX Network to demand that that episode be pulled. What is it regarding? O...kay, but if you've got a problem with ''Family Guy'', you'll have to wait in line.  Can I help you? Who are you? They went that way.  Look out! They have bear mace! Eat my shorts! I hate ''Family Guy''. Not nicely. Cool, man. Isn't that like, terrorism? I could do that. I'm a pretty bad kid. I stole the head off a statue once.  Who wants to know?!  No problem, man.  Cowabunga, motherfucker! Yeah. Shut up!  Did it work? Did you scare the network into pulling the episode? Cool man!  "Family Guy" better not show Mohammad tonight. I'm serious. "Family Guy" isn't funny.  We warned you not to show Mohammad- But "Family Guy" did it anyways. So now, here is our retaliation on America!!! Oh yeah, take THAT! We burned you! THAT WAS WAY FUNNIER THAN FAMILY GUY.  If you look closely at the writing in "Family Guy", you will see that the jokes never derive from the plot, and I think that's totally gay.  You one of them? How come your head ain't in the sand?  Ey, it's the least I could do. I hope you succeed, kid. I really don't wanna see ''Family Guy'' go off the air. I ''love'' that show! I mean, I know it's just joke after joke, but I ''like'' that. At least it doesn't get all preachy and up its own ass with messages, you know?   Mr. President!  Mr. President!  Mr. President!  Yeah!   What exactly did you learn about the ''Family Guy'' writing staff, Mr. President?    And what exactly ''is'' this First Amendment, Mr. President?   That's right!  Sir, there's still one little boy out here who wants to speak with you about pulling the ''Family Guy'' episode  Hello Mitchell. Oh, poor kid. Sir, if we pull the episode, the ''Family Guy'' writing staff will refuse to work again. Oh hi, Miss Travis.  Are you... sure? They're working on a new episode right now. All right, I'll take him back. Follow me, little Danny.  You must be excited. Not many people get to meet our writing staff. Well, here we are. Danny, the ''Family Guy'' writing staff. They're manatees.  Gretchen and Flubber are from the Gulf of Mexico. Tinker, Pete and Lucy are from the Caribbean Sea. They really are brilliant creatures.  Laundry Date Winning Mexico Gary Coleman. A perfect ''Family Guy'' joke! I can see it now! When FOX censored the image of Mohammad last week, it also meant that the Mohammad ball had to come out of the idea tank. It made the manatees very upset. Pull just one idea ball out of the idea tank, and the manatees stop working. He-here, I'll show you.  Manatees are very ethical writers. Either everything's okay to write about, or nothing is. Anyway, the president of the network wanted you to ...speak with the manatees. That isn't gonna work on them. Don't you know anything about manatees? They're the only mammals that are completely unmoved by terrorst threats. We don't know, Mr. President. They just stopped working. No sir, none of us did.  The president has asked that little Danny Pocket here speak with the ''Family Guy'' writing staff. Â¿QuÃ© pasa, seÃ±ores? Hi, welcome to P.F Chang's. How spicy would you like me to make your Chang sauce? Hi, welcome to P.F Chang's. How spicy would you like me to make your Chang sauce? Whatchoo talkin' 'bout, Willis? Twenty-five minutes. Abort System initiated. Awaiting confirmation. Mr. President, the terrorists are retaliating!  Hello, I am American. We like to crap own each other.   I'm American too. Ugh! We love to crap!  I'm American. I'm pregnant with a baby, but I'm not married.  Look at me! I'm Jesus! Would you like me to crap on you, Mr. Bush?  Mmm, yummy yummy crap.  To victory! Yeah! Chris, the people at Table 3 need their check. Well what about the new waiter? Everything okay here? All right, that's it! Get out of here! You're fired! Not him, you! Chris, the people at Table 3 need their check. Well what about the new waiter? Everything okay here? All right, that's it! Get out of here! You're fired! Not him, you!  How spicy would you like your Chang sauce? Oh man, I have no idea what's goin' on. Don't call me shoeless! You're shoeless! ''You're'' a towel! Yeah! Awww. Aw man, I really screwed up this time. The rent's due at the end of the month, and I don't have any money. I need to shape up and find a new job, quick.  Wait. Here it goes. Good ideas comin'. Yeah. Hey yeah! I should become a writer! If I just write a book about my life, I can get it published and then make plenty of money to pay rent.  How spicy would you like your Chang sauce? Oh man, I have no idea what's goin' on. Don't call me shoeless! You're shoeless! ''You're'' a towel! Yeah! Awww. Aw man, I really screwed up this time. The rent's due at the end of the month, and I don't have any money. I need to shape up and find a new job, quick.  Wait. Here it goes. Good ideas comin'. Yeah. Hey yeah! I should become a writer! If I just write a book about my life, I can get it published and then make plenty of money to pay rent. Yep! And it's all true. I guess I could edit those chapters down some. Huh? Why not? Wull yeah, but, maybe ''people'' will read my memoirs and like, apply its lessons to their own lives. ''You're'' a towel! Now what am I gonna do? I gotta pay rent and I just wasted three weeks writin' my memoirs. It's time for me to stop bein' so irresponsible. I've gotta shape up, focus, an' come up with ''real'' solutions to my problems.  Oh, maybe I shouldn't. All right, I'll just use my special gettin'-high powers one more time.   This is a really good idea.  McTowelie. Steven McTowelie. ...No. If I was a towel, why would I be wearin' this hat, an' this fake mustache?  All right! Well, I guess I'm just an extra-special tow-  person. Really?  Wow. I'm gonna get super-rich now. Well Larry, I'm a little high. Well Larry, I was... really just writin' down my memoirs as I- ''You're'' a towel. Well you're a ''beaner'' towel. I'm sorry. I'm high. Oh God, I'm ''really'' in trouble now.  Hello? Why? Hey yeah. Okay. Thanks Oprah! You're a real friend. All right, I got one chance here. I need to focus and come up with what I'm gonna say.  But, the ideas I come up with when I'm high keep gettin' me in trouble. Well, maybe just a ''little'' high.   Yeah. Yes, I'm pretty much a towel, Oprah. Well Oprah, I was all, like, um... uh, woo dat all like... It's like... Yeah. Yeah, that's it! But I thought you said- Huh? Hoooo! All right, I'm gonna get a little high.  No! No I'm NOT gonna get high! Every time I get high, I come up with ideas that get me in more trouble. I'm not gettin' high this time! Hey wait a minute.  Aw, that's okay. This whole thing was my fault. I learned that I shouldn't get high to come up with ideas. I should come up with ideas and then get high, to reward myself.  Will you just place our order, please? Fine, except this towel has been mixing Chang sauce for fifteen minutes. He's clueless! Yeah? Well you're a towel! Will you just place our order, please? Fine, except this towel has been mixing Chang sauce for fifteen minutes. He's clueless! Yeah? Well you're a towel! Aha. Mmm. Yes. Yes, I see. Well, that's quite a fascinating story, you being engineered as a towel with a computer chip that determines dryness. Chapters 4 through 8, however, seem to all be about Doritos Brand Corn Chips. Don't bother. I'm sorry to tell you this, sir, but nobody's ever going to publish your memoirs. Well, just the small trivial fact that... people aren't interested in autobiographies of towels. No. They won't. Because they're people. And you're a towel. No. I'm a big book publisher who's not the least bit interested in your stony memoirs. ''You're'' a towel. But you have to think of somethin' fast, an' gettin' high makes ''you smart''. Aw, come on. You need to come up with ideas of what to say on Oprah. Yeah. That's why you should only get a ''little'' high. Youuu said it.  Ogh. Oh my God. Uh I could not believe a human being has led this kind of life, Mr...! It's heartbreaking passages like this one: "I am a person who often gets hung out to dry by all those around me." I know this company would be honored to publish this book. I just have one small question first. You're not... a towel, are you? Right, I'm sorry.  Well Steveen, if it's all right with you, I'm gonna to get our agents and lawyers on the phone right now. We're in business, sir. Thank you so much.  Steven, when I read your book, I thought to myself, "How can a human being go through all this and still turn out okay?" You talk in your book how you would sometimes have to spend days hung up on a rack. What would that do to you emotionally? You have been through... so much,  and I think that people all over America could benefit... ...a life that kept getting up whenever it was down... Well Steven, your book hasn't sold a lot of copies yet, but I have some pretty exciting news for you! And so, Steven, I'm making your book my official Book of the Month selection!   Uh huh, okay. Well listen, maybe we can get her in as a guest on the 19th. All right, is John Travolta available to be a guest the week after that? Okay, that might work better since it's Sweeps Week. What's the big deal? His book helped people. Why does it matter than he made some stuff up? Are people really going to be that mad? Steven, it's Oprah. Can you come on my show again tomorrow? We need to tell the audience ''why'' you changed some of the facts in your book; that you thought it necessary to "heighten" certain things to make the book more relevant to people. Just come on the show and explain in a very level-headed way that changing some facts shouldn't matter if the book helps people, okay? See you tomorrow. Today my guest is once again Steven McTowelie, whose memoirs many of you purchased after I made it my Book of the Month Selection.  Now, it turns out that your name isn't really Steven. It's Towelie, correct? And you ''are'' a towel. Can you explain to the audience why you said you weren't a towel before? Was it that you thought ''embellishing'' the story was okay if it helped people? Well you know what I think, Towelie? I think you're a LYING SACK OF SHIT!  You lied to all these people, and for what??!! To make money!! They bought your book thinking it was true!! How DARE you like to ''me'' and make ''me'' look foolish?! You think writing is a joke, you stupid towel?! You will ''not'' get away with this! You lied to me, Towelie! And therefore you have lied to America!  Is this audience ready for a good old-fashioned lynching?! Audience, if you look under your seats, you'll find your very own torches!  We'll give you a five-second headstart.  Let's get him!  Looks like your time is up, Towelie! I've led my adoring fans RIGHT to you! I've shown my fans that... ugh! Ow! Wha??  What the hell is this??!! What is going on??!! AAAAaaah! No! Don't!   Oh God, there she goes again, babblin' about people's lives and carryin' on. She hasn't paid any attention to me in years! Nobody knows what it's like to be Oprah's minge. All she does is work, never gives her ol' minge a nice rub now and again. A minge needs attention! At least a scratch once in a while! Used to be a time when Oprah would play with me night and day. She'd pet me for hours usin' every finger. Now I just sit here, in the dark, not even so much as a pinky! I should write a book! Be much more depressin' than his! Can't take it anymore. All she ever does is work work work, never pays attention to the ol' minge. I'm always trapped in these stuffy pantsuits. I want attention! I'm bloody bored! Ay, 'oo's that? Is that you, Gary? Oh, what do you care? You're just an asshole. I'm a minge! Minges need stimulation. She's a workaholic. Let's face it: the only way we're ever goin' tuh get any attention is if Oprah doesn't work anymore. Not unless she gets fired. That bloke on the show today, the one Oprah supported. 'E isn't a bloke at all. 'E's a towel.  I'm a minge. Minges know a towel when they hear one. If evidence gets out that Oprah's champion author is a towel, she'll look right foolish. Fans'll start droppin' off by the millions. We get somebody else to do it. The greatest investiga'ive reporter of our time.  'Allo 'Eraldo. I've got some information for you ya might find interestin'. It could make Oprah Winfrey look quite foolish. Let's just say I work very closely with Oprah. You'd like to see 'er discredited, wouldn't ya? What'd 'e say? Just tell me wha' 'e says, Gary! Don't wait for me 'o ask you "wha' 'e say?"! Ay, don't get snooty with me, Gary! Oh all right Gary, this isn't workin'. Let's switch. I'll listen and you talk.  Don't give away your name. We don't want anyone to know where we are. Aw you stupid twit!! He didn't call you "stupid twit," I did!! Now just tell 'im this: Tell 'im 'e'd be surprised at things that can talk. 'E did it, Gary! 'Eraldo got the proof! It's the beginning of a new life for us, Gary. Without 'er career 'o worry about, Oprah's sure to travel the world! Enjoy the finer things in life! She'll spend hours just ... playin' with 'er own minge! Sure. And 'er Gary. We did it, mate! Ya hear that, Gary? Nobody's applaudin'! What's this? What's she doin'? She's getting everyone back on ''er'' side! Oh, tha' clever cow! There's not gonna ''be'' any Paris! Don't you get it, Gary?! The fat cow get everyone on 'er side again! She'll be workin' more than ever now! Our plan is ruined! All right! Everyone back! Get back I said!   Nobody moves, nobody gets hurt! Gettin' ou'a here Gary! One way or another!   I want a chooper! You got that?! And a jet waiting at the airport! Come on, Gary! You always said you wanted to see Paris! Stay back, mate! I'm warnin' you! No turnin' back now, Gary. Oh keep your head, Gary. Ah, Gary, that smells awful! Now I'm gonna throw up!  Try to leave and I'll shoot you too! You hostages aren't goin' anywhere till we get what we want! Put it underneath me.  This is Oprah's minge! I want a chopper, and a jet waiting at the airport to take us to France! Plus we need some fresh knickers right away. I'm not playing games with you, mate! Gary's drownin' in his own sick! Don't be stupid, Gary. I've got a policeman. They'll fry me, lock ''you'' up for life. We're gonna get out of here, mate. Just leave it to me. If that chopper isn't here in two minutes, I'm killin' a hostage! I mean it! Hostages are gonna start dyin' if you don't listen!  What the? Haha! You missed me, you stewpid buggers! You see that Gary? They can't even aim! Gary, what's, what's wrong? No... Oh no! Try to hang on, Gary! Oh Gary! What have I gotten ya into? I'm 'ere, Gary! Yeah. Yeah, we're in Paris, mate. Ih, it's beautiful. We've finally made it!  Well, there's the... Eiffel Tower right in front of us. The Louvre, right over there behind ya. And f-fresh baguettes all around. Gary? Gary, say somethin'.  I'm comin' to see ya!  Oh stop your complainin'! I'm tryin' to ''sleep'' back here. Yes it's me. You think you've go' it bad? Oprah hasn't paid any attention to ''me'' in years. Assholes need stimulation too, you bastard! I want to travel. I want to see Paris. I thought lamp was goin' to get better, but Oprah's always busy. Werkin' and werkin', diyatin' and not diyatin'. I need a pukin' up mounds of chocolate cake or teaspoons of weedgrass. Well that'll never happen.  Fired... You got a plan, Mingie? Ooo. How d'you know? 'Ow do we get proof? 'E wants to know who 'e's speakin' with. He wants to know what information we have. Stop wastin' my time. I didn't say "stop wastin' my time," Geraldo did. Hallo? This is Gary. A'right, look. All you need to know is that I'm definitely ''not'' Oprah's asshole. Don't call me a twit, Geraldo! The writer of the book on Oprah's Book of the Month Club is a phonih. He's not a person at all. He's a towel. You'd be surprised at things that can talk. Just look into the author of "A Million Little Fiyabers," and you'll discover the truth. Oprah's got egg all over her face! She'll have to retire! And her Gary too. Yeah! They're all right pissed off! This is great! I don't understand, Mingie. Minge, does this mean I have to wait to see Paris? No! Mingie, what're you doin'? Mingie, have you lost your mind? Not like this, Mingie. Not like this! Jesus Minge! You killed him! You shot him dead! Oh God, I think I'm goinna be sick eh. I can't, uh... I'm goinna puke!  Oh just put down the gun, Mingie. Maybe they'll go easy on us.  Aw Mingie, I'm soo scared.  Mingie. They got me, Mingie. Aye. They got me bad. Oh, the blood. Ih... It's gettin' dark, Minge. I've seen muh life flash before me eyes. Mingie! Where... where are we, Mingie? Are we in Paris? Ahhh... Is it as wonderful as I 'oped? Tell me what you see, Mingie. Ahhh... I can smell them, Mingie. At least I got to see Paris before I-  What is it, Dimitri?  Thith ith Geraldo. Who am I thpeaking with?!  What information do you have? What ith going on here?! Who ith thith? Gary who?! What is your last name?! A towel? A talking towel? That doethn't make any thenthe. What proof do you have of this accusation?! And how do I go about that?  Hello? HELLO?! Hello? Larry, are you receiving me? Larry, this brave reporter has been days investigating and researching, and I have come up with a shocking discovery that is going to rock the balls and ass of the literary world! Steven McTowelie, author of "A Million LIttle Fibers," is a towel! No, ''you're'' a towel. What did you say?? I'm standing in the business district of central Chicago, where Oprah's vagina has killed a police officer and taken several people hostage. It is yet unconfirmed but believed that Oprah's asshole may be an accomplice in this as well. There's somebody on the phone to speak with you. He says he has inside information for you that may discredit Oprah Winfrey.   My guest tonight is Steven McTowelie, author of the acclaimed book, "A Million LIttle Fibers." How are you tonight, Steven? Your book has helped a lot of people beat addiction. What made you write it?  We're here, Geraldo. You're live on the show. This looks pretty bad, Oprah. Your fans look to you to be all-knowing and all-seeing, and you've just spent two weeks supporting a lying racist towel. Oprah, we need to know what we're going to do. Your book got me to give up alcohol! But I thought you were a person! Yeah, we want our money back, you dumb towel! Â¡No insultar Mexicanos! Â¿Oye? Â¡No insultar Mexicanos! Â¿Oye? That's right! They did it! They killed him!  Hey! Nice. Yeah, you you get him, Oprah! Poor woman. She's a victim. Yeah! Yeah! Whoa. Burn that which lies to Oprah! All right Oprah!  All right, gig is up. Put down the gun! Drop the gun and step away.  Did your son ''say'' anything before he disappeared, Mrs. Stotch? Oh my God, what are we goinna do? You got us into this, towel. Think of somethin'! Yeah, it sure was. We're sorry we tried to burn you and murder you before. Got the walkie-talkie you asked for. Hellow, I'm Lieutenant Nelson. What are your demands? All right, how about fresh underwear for one hostage. All right, we'll work on it. Don't do anything foolish.  We don't have any time; this is the most unstable vagina I've ever talked to.  Not with those hostages so close! It's too risky! All right, that's it. Take it out!  Oprah's going to be okay. Wish I could say the same for her vagina and asshole. O'Reilly, you got a shot?  Oprah's vagina, this is your last warning! Put down the gun! Hostages are clear! That's a great idea you had to sneak the hostages inside the bank. Thank you, Mr. Mackey, students of South Park Elementary.. I'm here to educate you about the single biggest threat to our planet. You see, there is something out there which threatens our very existence and may be the end of the human race as we know it. I'm talking of course about...  It is a creature which roams the earth alone. It is half man, half bear, and half pig. Some people say that ManBearPig isn't real. Well, I'm here to tell you know, ManBearPig is very real, and he most certainly exists. I'm serial. ManBearPig doesn't care who you are or what you've done. ManBearPig simply wants to get you! I'm super-serial.  But have no fear, because ''I'' am here to save you! And someday, when the world is rid of ManBearPig, everyone will say "Thank you, Al Gore. You're super awesome." The end. Thank you, class. Excelsior!  I'm spreading ManBearPig awareness. Here, each of you kids take a pamphlet and a bumper sticker.  I hope now you boys see that this is totally serial. The next time, it could be the "real" ManBearPig. Can I just get you to sign the awareness sheet? Just your name and phone number and where you first heard about ManBearPig?  Hello. Be safe.  Hello, this is Al Gore. I was the vice president. Can you and your friends make it to an emergency ManBearPig meeting tomorrow morning? I have some evidence he could be in this area.  Oh. I get it. You don't believe me either. Yes it is. Nobody believes me!  No you don't. Are you serial?  Hi kids! Come on in!  Okay, let's get this meeting started. What do you kids think we should do to stop ManBearPig?  What does your dad look like?? Does he have large hooves where his feet should be?? Damn. For a minute there, I thought we found him.  Oh Jesus on ice skates, we've gotta get down there right away. I can get you all excused from school.  Look! You boys have a chance to help me find and kill ManBearPig once and for all! I'm totally serial! Have you noticed high deposits of sulfur or a salmon-like odor coming from the caves lately? All right, kids, I need you to keep an eye out for ManBearPig droppings. Similar to pig droppings, but more manbearlike. Groan! Groan!  Not yet.  Kids! Kids, over here! Look. I bet this is where he's hiding.   No! Leave them alone, you Goddamned ManBearPig! Damn you ManBearPig! They're just children!  Excuse me, Ex''cuse'' me. This cave-in was no accident, and it isn't going to stop unless we move fast! I am super... duper... serial! I'm afraid you have a much bigger problem than a cave-in. No, stupid! It's ManBearPig!  Why won't anybody listen to me?! ManBearPig is in there and we have to kill him while we all have the chance. I'm serial! I told you we need to fill the cave with hot molten lead, 'cause it's the only way to make sure ManBearPig never comes out! And I'm sane and I'm totally serial, but everyone just keeps digging! They're already dead! Didn't you listen to me?? They got attacked by a ManBearPig and ManBearPig leaves nobody alive! I'm super serial! Nobody will listen to me but I'm serial!  This is the end of you, ManBearPig.  Excelsior!  I did it. I killed ManBearPig. I've saved the earth from certain destruction. Everyone is super-stoked on me, even if they don't know it. We are gathered here to say goodbye to four kids whom we all tried to help, but, in the end, could not. But where there is loss, there is hope. For ManBearPig is no more. I have beaten ManBearPig, and we will never forget the names of the brave young kids who lost their lives. Kid 1, Kid 2, Kid 3, and of course, Kid 4.  And how Kid 2 was always there when I needed him.  Kids! I saved you!   FOOD!  Don't worry, it's not really ManBearPig. It's me, Al Gore. Hello everyone, welcome to Cave of the Winds. Our tour is gonna take us to two chambers in one of the most elaborate cavern systems in Colorado.  Mr. Gore asked me to make sure you all knew he was here. Now, once we enter the cave we do ask you that you follow two rules: stay on the path and do not touch anything. Aright, are we ready? Let's go cavin'.  Here we are in the main chamber of the cave; it was discovered in 1892 and first used as a hideout for smugglers of the Old West.  Now, as you can see, the cave is filled with stalagmites and stalactites. Water drips from the cave's... These rocks often make interesting shapes which we like to name. For instance, this one here we named "The Hanging Mushroom."  Now the cave itself is millions of years old and has a constant temperature of 57 degrees. Sir? Mr. Gore? Is there a problem? All right, everyone, if you'll step this way, you'll see how the cave gets its name.  In certain areas of the cave, the wind actually blows through, causing a sound you can hear.  O-kay, everyone, out of the cave. Now!  Ih it's a room near the end of the tour where you can get your picture taken with fake treasure. Here, see?  Oh Jesus, here we go again.  Yeah. Wow... Aaaah!  Help! The cave-in was massive. It has cut off all access in or out. The children are believe to be trapped somewhere in this area.  No, nobody seems to knew them. Only that they were in the tour group. Digging to them is going to take days. What do you mean? The cave-in is over. What's that?  All right, people, we've gotta work faster! Our best estimate still puts us three days from reaching the area of the cave called Smuggler's Den. Based on where the boys were seen last, they're somewhere near this area! Hopefully they've followed the first rule of survival and stayed put. That's it! Pull everyone out! There's nothing more we can do! We didn't plan on a freak river flood. God must really want those kids dead. Look, the cavern is completely flooded. Nothing could have survived. There's nothing left alive down there.  It's the kids!  Does anybody know who these kids are? Naw, I f- I feel kind of bad for him. I don't think he has any friends. What is that, a pigbearman? Mr. Gore, please, we need you to calm down. Now, w-what exactly do you suggest we do? Well, see, the problem is that if we fill the caves with hot molten lead, it will kill those boys too. Do you want me to get the ex vice president out of here? It's been three days since four unidentified children were trapped in a cave-in. Three days without food and time is certainly running out. The digging continues, but progress is fatally slow. Smuggler's Den? You're calling off the rescue? Well what if the children ''aren't'' dead?  They're alive!  Hey, that looks like the fake treasure from our Smuggler's Den photo room. Yeah, we put it there for kids to take their picture with. All in all, I'd say that treasure is worth about fourteen dollars. Eric, why would you do such a thing? That's very naughty, Eric.  He just never listens. It's not him, it's ''you'', Eric.  I don't know what to do with you.  Yes. I think it's the nanny, poopsiekins. Oh, thank you so much for coming. Please come in.  All, all right dear.  Yeah, it's best to avoid his level. Eric, naughty. Oh, but we really need some help.  What do you mean? Oh dear. I don't know what else to do about my son's behavioral problems. We've been through every nanny reality show on television. Please, come in. Well, he's just... out of control. I mean, he never listens to me, and he pretty much runs my life. What what is it that you're doing? Oh, that's very interesting. Well, no, I don't.  Ahall right.  Tsst. It doesn't seem to work as well when I do it. Oh, very good, sweetie. Wow, I have a lot to learn. Oh dear.  But what if he ''does'' run away? Oh Eric, I'm so happy you're home. Look what I did, Eric. I learned how to make Sumie paintings. I had almost forgotten how artistic I was. Cesar... Yup, just like you said he would. He said he's hungry. What should I do? Eric, if you don't want to eat then, why don't you go brush your teeth and go to bed?!  Tsst.   Tsst.   Tsst.  Oh... Oh my gosh! He's never done this before. I love you very much, poopsiekins. You're Mommy's sunshine.  Eric, I want you to go upstairs and brush your teeth. Then I'll be up to read you a story before bed.  Oh my goodness. I can't believe it. I am the pack leader!  Sounds divine! Oh, he's been amazing, Cesar. He got an A on his last spelling test and a B+ in history. He's losing weight and he's doing what I tell him. The best part is I'm not letting him boss me around anymore. I could have ''never'' come out and have a nice lunch on a Saturday afternoon with a friend before. There's just one problem: he still fights me every step of the way. I feel like he's ''doing'' what I tell him, but that inside he's still the same angry spoiled child. Oh Cesar, I'm so happy to have you in my life.  Why Eric, you made your own breakfast. And you're studying before school?  Oh, Eric. I'm very proud of you. I love you, sweetie. Cesar. I'm so happy you're back. Oh, he's amazing. I think the change in personality happened. He's doing things for himself now, and he seems to be accepting it. I've lost a best friend, but I've gained a son. You're the best, Cesar, and to show my gratitude I've got two tickets for you and me to see ''Madame Butterfly'' this Friday night. Oh... But I thought we were becoming friends. Eric, how would you like to go with me to see ''Madame Butterfly'' Friday night? Well, what if I took you to Kentucky Fried Chicken afterward?  And then we'll go to Target and buy you a Mega Ranger.  Yes hon?  What hon? Oohh, that's a big boy, isn't he?  There you are, Eric. What are you doing here? When does it come out?  It's time for school. Eric, you're just going to have to be patient.  Eric, you're coming home right now! It's almost bedtime. If you sleep then time'll go by faster.  Whoa! Eric, get out of there.   You need to learn to be patient! There you are, Eric. Eric, you have to come home. You can't just wait here for that game to come out. But, honey, it's only September. That...  Nintendo Wii doesn't come out for two months. Who are you talking to, muffin? ''My mom's the best mom, better than your mom.<br />It's singing together in harmony.''   Look, I'm skating, I'm skating! What? It's right here.  What? You can't just push me up against the- Aah! It's time for Nanny Stella to show Eric Cartman his ways are ''not'' going to be tolerated anymore!   Hello. I'm Nanny Stella. And you must be Eric. Hold on, Mrs. Cartman. There are going to be some rule changes around here, Eric. First of all, no video games until chores are done. I'm serious. Let's put down the video game and go to the kitchen. Right. Then I'm going to have to take it.  Come on.  All right, that's it!   Whenever you are naughty, Eric, you are going to sit on this stool for five minutes. It's the time-out stool. You can't get down until the time is up. Eric, you have to stay in time-out!  Come on, you don't have a choice.  Eric, you need to understand ''why'' you are being punished. All right? Well then, I'll just have to stand ''right here''!  He spit in my mouth! All right! I've dealt with this before! We just need to use psychology on him!  Eric, can I just talk to you for a quick second? Why are you so angry? Is this about more than your video game? Are you feeling angry at me because you think I'm here to change your life? And you're feeling like I have no right to come in and tell ''you'' how to live.  See this? You have to take the time to talk to your children about their feelings. What else are you feeling, Eric? Me? Well, it's because I love children, like you. Oh, I just never had kids. It... just... didn't happen. Why you, you...  you little bastard! How dare you?! What kind of  monster would- That's it!  I'm not doing this! Find yourself another nanny... television show! This child's behavior is totally unacceptable! Well, there's no trial too tough for Super Nanny! In just three days' time you're going to see a new Eric Cartman.  From heeell! It's from heeell! I'm afraid Super Nanny is in a deep state of mental psychosis. I mean,  Well there... is... one more show you could still try. No dog is too much for me to handle. I rehabilitate dogs, I train people. I am the dog wheesperer. So tell me what are the problems you are having with the child? So the child needs to learn that he's not the most important person in the house. See I'm not looking at the child, I'm not acknowledging the child, I'm just letting the child know I'm not interested in him. See the child thinks your world revolves around him, because it does. Because everything he does gets a response from you.  Tsst. Don't look at the child; just keep looking at me. Let, let him know we are having a conversation.  Tsst. Dogs show their dominance by nipping each other on the neck, but it works equally well on a child. I just use two fingers, nip at the child's neck, doesn't hurt the child, just let him know I am dominant.  Tsst.  Tsst. See, I'm not validating his bad behavior with either negative or positive response. I think the first thing we need to work on is getting the child some exercise. He's fat and he has all this pent-up energy that-  Tsst. -we need to let him burn off. Do you take walks with your son? Go on, take your son for a walk. See once again, I am the one going for a walk. It's about me, the child is lucky to come along.  Tsst. Don't look at him, just look straight ahead and he'll run out of evergy soon.  Here, why don't you try it now? Take your son.  Good. Just keep your confidence, shoulders back, eyes straight ahead. The child can pick up on that confidence, learning he's supposed to follow you, not lead you. Good, Ms. Cartman. Very good! It is important to understand that dogs run in packs. And one dog is always dominant: the pack leader. You must assert yourself as pack leader with dominant energy. Okay, let me show you how to express the dominant energy. What I have done is I have brought over some Kentucky Fried Chicken.  I am going to eat first, because that is what the pack leader does.   Tsst. I am not going to acknowledge the child's attempt at aggressive dominant behavior. Now you eat the chicken.  We won't reward him until he's in a calm submissive behavior.  We need him to become relaxed and submissive. Oh no, now he's lying. You can tell from his stance he's still aggressive-dominant. See?  Tsst.   I am not being aggressive; I am being dominant. It's okay, this is all part of the dominance struggle. Let him go. He'll be back. This a good opportunity for you to relax and enjoy your favorite hobby.  How is the painting going? Oh look, it came back. Well, let's feed it. This is more aggressive-dominant behavior. Don't nurture it. Come on, Ms. Cartman, you must become pack leader. What do you do? Nooo, you're asking him a favor. Don't ask a favor, ''dominate''!  You project the dominant energy and he ''will'' pick up on it. I promise. Shoulder back, head high, don't reason with it, don't argue with it, just dominate it. You see? You're calm, assertive, and in control.  See? This is the behavior we've been looking for. This is a relaxed, submissive state. Good. Now you can reward the behavior with praise and attention. Now you can give him a snack.  Good, this is really good. Now try a command. This is a great first step, but you're gonna have to stay firm and confident. You are the pack leader now. Now before you go read your son his story let's go enjoy a nice quiet cup of tea. So, how is your son doing, Ms. Cartman? That's greeat! Good, Ms. Cartman, sounds like you're treating your son like a son and not like a friend. Don't worry. When you correct the behavior, eventually you will see a change in the personality. How is the child doing? That's much healthier for him, and when he gets older he'll be able to be your friend too. Well no, my work is done. I've got to get back to Los Angeles. No, not really. You're just a client. Well, good luck to you. Gotta go.  Who is your best friend? What's my last name? We can really stick it to that assm-m-muncher! So what's the p-plan? All right, Eric. You can c-c-count on us. Kenny's down. K-k-kenny is down.  Who would take a d-dump in a urinal? It's such a s-senseless crime. Hey fellas.  You should come downstairs. Stan's mom made pa-pizza. Du... du... dude. Wait. Maybe I don't have the right to kill my mom. She isn't an object you can own. She's a human being. The world doesn't revolve around me? The world doesn't revolve around me! No, she's just... out to make you suffer! Idiot!   World of Warcraft support line. O..ohhh that shouldn't happen. We designed the game so that players have to agree to a duel before they can kill each other. Really? That's odd.  Well, we'll certainly keep a look out for that player and ban him from the network.  Better tell the guys upstairs. Oh no. Fellow board members, we have a problem: somebody in the World of Warcraft is ignoring the World's rules...and is going around killing innocent players.. We can't. Whoever this player is, he has played World of Warcraft so much, that he has reached a level we thought unreachable. He's actually able to ''kill'' our admins. And he grows stronger every day. Jim, your kids' characters are already dead.  Only one kind. Whoever this player is, he has played World of Warcraft nearly every hour of every day for the past year and a half. Gentlemen, we are dealing with someone here who...has absolutely no life. What? Yes. And it won't be long before everyone gets really really frustrated and stops playing altogether. Gentlemen, this could very well lead to the end of the World...of Warcraft. My God...they must have no lives at all. A chance. The admins tell us they are four players from a small town in Colorado. Apparently it could cause 120 damage per second, with an instant mana burn and an enchantment that boosts its stamina +80. Soltzman. He's an accountant. Behold, the Sword of a Thousand Truths.  We must get this sword to the ones who have proven they have no life. Let's just hope to Christ they don't start the battle before we can reach them. Where is he?! Sir, we don't have time! We just heard from our admins that your son's party is already in battle! We're too late. Without the sword the players will fail. I don't have a World of Warcraft account. Do you? Our world is saved!  Why kill innocent players? The game is about finishing quests. How many people's characters were in there? There are over seven million people who log on to World of Warcraft! Are you telling me all those people's characters are going to die, and there's nothing we can do to save them? Are they strong enough to defeat the Evil One? There has to be...someway we can help them. What is this sword? Who foretold this prophecy? We are looking for a great knight by the name of LovesToSpooge. Unless they have this sword,  your son's character is going to die! Stupid? I-if we could get to a computer, we could sign on to the World of Warcraft and give the boys the sword online. No, I have a life.  You? We can't trust the Sword of a Thousand Truths to a newb! We took a cab here! They did it! We've got to delete him from the servers. What kind of person would ''do'' this? Over five thousand.  Jesus... How do you kill...that which has no life?  Oh Jesus...Oh God no... He just finished killing every single player in the Arathi Highlands. Sir, you'd better have a look at this! Four of our subscribers...They've gone up fifty levels in three weeks. A hope?  I've gotta get home! My kids are playing World of Warcraft right now! No...  They just started playing!  Randy, you workin' on that sediment analysis?  Is that a computer game? Hm. Looks like that guy just killed you.   My doctor says I'm not supposed to. I don't wanna have cancer!  But why me, coach? Why? Oh.  Hi, coach. Yeah, it's a pretty bad time for me, coach. I'm only five and I'm dying.  Coach, what's it like when you die? How come I have to die now? I mean, how come I don't get to grow up? I'm sorry. I think so. Thanks, coach.  Will you do me just one favor, Coach? That game tonight? I'm gonna be watching, so... could you... make it so I don't have cancer? Well then, will you just... win for me? Coach. I feel pretty good, except for the cancer.  Coach? Does God hate me?  Oh. My cancer hurts. Wow.  At the Pepsi Center? That's our biggest game ever. Do you think we can win, Coach? All right! Maybe there IS hope for me. No hope. No... hope...  Mine too! Aaaa!  No! Don't do it! Hguh. Then how come you couldn't do it? Timmy! Yeah, my mom says I have to be in bed at 9:30.  No! Nooooooooo!  We ran the numbers: even ''with'' their amazing rise in levels, they have a 90% mortality probability. They'd be walking in a slaughter! <poem><i>Live to win, 'till you die, 'till the light dies in your eyes<br />Live to win, take it all, just keep fighting 'till you fall<p>Day by day, kickin' all the way, I'm not cavin' in<br />Let another round begin, live to win<br />Live to win<br />Live to win<br />Yeah, win.</p></i></poem> What about...the Sword of a Thousand Truths? Quiet, Thomas! We aren't even to ''speak'' of that sword! It is not an option! Long ago, when the World of Warcraft was created, one of the programmers put a sword called the Sword of a Thousand Truths into the game inventory. But the sword was considered to be too powerful for anyone to possess. So it was removed from the game and stored on a one-gig flash drive. But maybe these new players are the ones the prophecy foretold of. But it was foretold that one day, players who ''could'' wield the sword might reveal themselves. Ready. So what?!  Our demo is set up right over by the-  I'm sorry, Mr. Mackey, but there just isn't really any evidence to go on. But who would benefit from crapping in the urinal? Uh this is too big a mystery for me. I think we'd better call in the Hardly Boys. So, that's it, Hardly Boys, we've got no leads and nobody admitting to the crime. Has she performed oral sex on him? ...Nice.  Nisssse. Yeah, boys going to Milan with a beautiful older woman. Quick! Call the FBI!  The Hardly Boys. Two young whippersnappers with a knack for solving mysteries. The Hardly Boys in:  The Mystery of the Urinal Turd. The Hardly Boys. Two young whippersnappers with a knack for solving mysteries. The Hardly Boys in:  The Case of the World Trade Center Conspiracy. The year is 2006, and young Eric Cartman cannot wait for the new Nintendo Wii to come out. Unable to cope with the wait any longer, Eric decides to freeze himself for three weeks. But a freak avalanche makes Eric impossible to find, and so he remains frozen for 500 years. That sure is a mystery. Whoever did it must have been angry with the school. Oh... Oooo... I think I'm getting a clue. Yeah, this is totally giving me a clue right now. My clue is kind of pointing this way. I've still got a raging clue. Oh, let's follow that clue!  And nobody knows who's responsible? Ooo... oh, I just started getting a clue. Yeah, I'm totally getting a clue. Mine's pointing to the left. Okay, let's follow your raging clue. Gave us both a clue. I got such a raging clue that I almost shot clue goo all over Joe. It was huuuge.  Yeah, it sounds super-hard. F-really?  Oh... I'm starting to get a clue too.  Ohhgh. Yeah, now I've got a total clue.  My clue's pointing over there now! Nnnn, who would benefit most from two buildings disappearing? Really? Oh... Oh, that's giving me a clue. Yeah, ye-yeah, I've got a raging clue right now. Oh F-, oh Frank, seriously, I have such a raging clue right now, I think we'd better follow it. Oofff. I was getting a clue like every two minutes. This is my frog. He doesn't have a name. He's a frog not a toad because toads don't ribbit. I think frogs are good pets.  Well, what really happened? There's strong evidence that what we were told isn't the truth. It's obvious that before we go any further, we need to find out who was behind 9/11 once and for all! Oh no, oh brother, oh God. Oh no, oh God, that's so retarded. [stands up] That's right. Did you know that there were explosions seen at the base of the towers? This is too big a mystery for me. I think we'd better call in the Hardly Boys. So that's about the long and short of it, Hardly Boys. There were two towers that stood right here,  and they're gone. There are theories, but, nobody's certain. You're so full of crap, Foley. Yeah, it a way of keeping people from seeing the real evidence. I know it seems crazy, but 9/11 was pulled off by our own government, so they could gain support for attacking the Middle East. I know it's hard to believe. It's called the False Flag policy. Make it look like the enemy attacked you. Get all your citizens riled up and waving American flags. Then you're free to invade any country you want.  Look into the evidence of 9/11 and you'll see there are a lot of holes in their story. You don't understand! The government controls everything. The media, the corporations, they have the power to do anything they want. Here, look!  Read the labels on these! Go on, read them! We think they came from a government office. It's anthrax. Someday we'll use it as evidence against them. You won't get away with it! People know! Wait. What are you doing? No! You can't do this!  Oh no! Oh no!  No. Please. Pleeease! Don't kill me! I, I just do what they say! I have a family. Please don't kill me! Mr. Mackey, there's something you should know... Come on in, Mr. President.  SSHHUUDDUUPP!! You think we don't know your name?! We know everything! We control everything!  We've all worked very hard to keep our involvement in 9/11 a secret! But you just had to keep digging! People? You mean sheeple. We have the majority of them kept in blissful ignorance. Just one more... leak...   You've been a thorn in our side for too long, I'm afraid. Too late.   Some pigs never learn. Yes. Quite simple to pull off, really. All I had to do was have explosives planted in the base of the towers. Then on 9/11 we pretended like four planes were being hijacked.when really we just rerouted them to Pennsylvania, then flew two military jets into the World Trade Center filled with more explosives, then shot down all the witnesses of Flight 93 with an F-15 after blowing up the Pentagon with a Cruise missile. It was only the world's most intricate and flawlessly-executed ever, ever.  and get the oil which made us all richer than before. We are all-knowing and all-powerful. Good-bye, boys.  For Christ's sake, Cheney!  KILL THEM!   Boys, you don't understand. People need to think we are all-powerful. That we control the world. If they know we weren't in charge of 9/11 then... we appear to control nothing. We do that too. And most people believe the truth. But one fourth of the population is retarded. If they wanna believe we control everything with intricate plans, why not let them?  Hahaha. He died like a pig.  Beauutiful money, hahahaha! Dangit! I missed again!  It isn't safe here, boys. Follow me! There's no time! come on!   I'm a detective, and I'm afraid that you kids have been double-crossed. Not me. My mystery-solving sons. Come on in, boys.  My boys were researching who went number two in the urinal at your school when they discovered something odd, which gave them a clue. That clue led them to a 9/11 conspiracy group party, where they got a lot more clues. Those clues pointed out that all the 9/11 conspiracy theories could be disproven scientifically. And that's when Frank got his biggest clue. That all the 9/11 conspiracy Web sites are run by the government. The 9/11 conspiracy... is a government conspiracy. For a government to have power, they must appear to have complete control. What better way to make people fear them than to convince them they are capable of the most elaborate plan on earth? Just one thing, Mr. President: How the devil did you know we were all here?  And the government was more than willing to take the blame, so long as it made them look responsible for 9/11! Well, it looks like this mystery is solved. It's time for the culprit to finally pay!  Eric, I have to take you to the principal's office. I've been instructed to bring you to the principal's office. I'm just doin' my job.  Hey, kid, get outta there. And so this shape with four sides is what, class? What are you doing?! I don't think that's really necessary. That's enough, class!  Ike, I'm very flattered, by all of your love notes, but I need to be clear. See, there've been a lot of female teachers on the news lately who have been having relationships with young male students and, people might get the wrong idea, even though... I do admire you. You are so smart and gifted. Soo mature for your age. You listen, and you really care about what I have to say. You make me feel things I've never...  That was unbelievable. I've never felt like such a woman before. They'll say our love is wrong, but we can't let anybody know; they'll never understand.  OOOH!  Oh, what's the use, Ike? We're caught.  Hold on, please, you don't understand. Your brother and I... are in love. Ike is very mature for his age, and you know it! He makes me feel like nobody else does. He loves me and only me, and I know I'm a goddess to him. When we make love, he can give it to me HARD, or soft and gentle- Is it so hard to believe that true love exists? Ike has a crush on teacher! Ike has a crush on teacher!  What? I did shoot him in the face. Twice. A woman? Some young boy is having sex with Miss Stevenson? Nisssse. You sure they've had sex? Nisssse. The crime is, she isn't doing it with me.  Do we still press charges? No, really! I shot both of them! They weren't even doin' nothin'! Oh? What's the crime? Oh my God! This is terrible!  Ya-you did the right thing telling the police, Brad. Now, who is the teacher? What's his name? The blonde? Nnice. So wait, what, what's the crime? You're right. We're sorry. This ''is'' serious. We need to track this student down and... give him his "Luckiest Boy In America" medal right away.   Well, that explains it. Who are we gonna convict? Johnny Walker? Are you sure you're not lying, Foley? You're kidding! Damnit, where were all these sexed-up teachers when ''I'' was a kid?!  All right all right, we'll make a report. Jesus... Oh, but, but she's ugly, right? Okay, just continue with your macaroni pictures. Teacher has to step out for a second. Uh Ike, could you help me out, please?  Oh Ike, I just had to have a second alone with you. I got your love letter, and I wrote you one back. Oh, just one kiss to hold me over for the rest of class.   Oh uhh, we were just heading back in. I don't need a hall pass. I'm a teacher. Look, just let us get back in- We're going back inside! Bear mace?? Oooooh!  Oh God... I'm at the police station. They say they found some evidence. I'm so scared.  Listen, I want you to know it's okay. If anybody tries to talk to you, you don't need to say anything. Just leave it to me. I know a way out of this. I am deeply sorry to announce that the allegations against me are true. Over the past several weeks, I have been having physical relations with one of my students. I know my actions were wrong, but I cannot be fully to blame. You see, I am an alcoholic. Yes, I'm afraid it's true. I am a perfectly good person, but when I drink, the alcohol makes me say and do things I wouldn't normally do. No, but my uncle used to ask me and my twin sister to kiss and he'd take pictures. All better now.  Ike.  Ike, we have to get out of here! They'll never let us be together. I think... I think we should go to Milan, like we always talked about.  Get your things together. We don't have much time. Ike, is that all you're gonna do is watch TV?  Oh no! Ike!  They're on to us! Hurry darling! We have to get out of here! Come on, darling!  Ike, run!  Why couldn't you just leave us alone? All we wanted was to love. It's all over, Ike. Milan, the house in Tuscany. They'll never let us be together! We have to go with the backup plan.   You can't accept our love? So then we can only be together in eternity. You who don't believe in true love don't understand. I'm afraid you're too late.  Tom, an elementary school teacher is under arrest for allegedly having an affair... with one of her young students. The case is shocking, due mostly to the fact that the teacher... is pretty hot, Tom. If the accusations are true, then... damn! Uh, looks like the defendant and her lawyer are about to give a statement, Tom. Ohhhh.  Good luck, ma'am. You can beat your alcoholism.  Alcohol is a crutch which we use to medicate ourselves; to, to cover up emotional baggage from our past. Was there ever a history of sexual abuse in your family? Nissse.  Congratulations, Miss Stevenson.  She ran away; now she got to deal with the Dawg, huh?  She gawt a scarf awn her heyed, huh? Hey! You can't leave your car there!  I think you should leave before I call the police!  Yes?  Do you mind keepin' it down? What have we got? What have we got?! Who called 911?!  Hey!  Uh I got 'em, Dawg. Fifth floor! Freeze!  All right, Miss Stevenson, you got nowhere to go!  Now hold on, don't do anything foolish! We can talk about this! Hands up! Hands up! Hey kid, you need to get off the roof now. Don't move! Don't move! Hey, that ''is'' the teacher we just got the report about.   Halloween is a night for evil. It is time for me to take what is mine. On Halloween we shall open the Gates of Hell, rise up to the earth, and we will rent out the entire W Hotel, for an awesome party, and invite a bunch of celebrities! Have you seen those rich, spoiled, teenage girls who have massive Sweet 16 parties? That big. SILENCE!   What is it? Well I have to invite celebrities or else my party won't be cool.  I'm not alienating my friends! I know they come first! So I want the DJ to set up over here, and then the main dance floor area can be this whole area right here. Oh, it's like a dimensional vortex gate thingy, they won't have cars. I want all the servers dressed in skimpy outfits serving all the hors d'oeuvres. Shut up, it's Halloween! This is my night! Then at midnight, for dessert, I'm thinking over here, we bring out a huuuge chocolate fondue fountain. Oh, screw that, then. I don't want a fondue fountain if P Diddy had one. Yes it matters! I don't wanna do it if Diddy did it! Did Diddy do it? A full ice cream bar!  Yes. It's perfect. At midnight, all the lights go down. The music stops. And then we wheel in... a Ferrari. Only it isn't a Ferrari... It's a cake. And everyone gets a piece.  they will shudder and know my greatness!  Yeah, it's okay, but everyone thinks Zazul's schoolgirl costume is hotter. Zazul, switch costumes with me. Nobody can look hotter than me! It's my Super Sweet 16 Halloween party! Take it off, Zazul.  And what about my Ferrari cake?! Where's the Ferrari cake?!  Get out of the way, Hitler! You're ruining my entrance! Gaau! This is VIP. Don't just let anybody into my VIP area, okay?  What? Oh jeez.  Hey, uh, hi, listen, dude, ya know, the whole Crocodile Hunter thing? It... it's just a little soon, you know? I mean, he just dies a few weeks ago and... it's just not supercool and you gotta leave.   I know, but just wait till midnight. You are not gonna believe what's coming for desert!   Acura?? But I wanted a Ferrari!  IT'S NOT THE CAR I WANTED! THE WHOLE PARTY'S RUINED!   Oh God, what's happened to me? I've never been this terrible before. By trying to have a party like those spoiled rich teenage girls on MTV, I've become like one of them. But I am. Throwing people out, making a big entrance, having these stupid pictures of me all over. Halloween is supposed to be for everyone. Everybody, I'm sorry. This party is for you. It's for all of you who make my life so special. If I don't realize that, then I'm no better than a rich American teenage girl.   What do you plan, Lord Satan? Satan, I must speak with thee. You've invited so many celebrities on Earth to your party that people in Hell can't get wristbands. Satan, I warn thee, do not throw this party at the cost of alienating your friends. I hope for your sake that's true. You've never thrown a party of this magnitude before, Satan. Be wary.  This is getting really expensive.  Does it matter?! How about a doughnut machine? A Ferrari cake? Satan, really, the logistics of getting a cake the size of a Ferrari made in time- Yes. Yes, Satan. Your Halloween costume turned out perfect. Satan, Zazul worked really hard on his costume. Relax, it's being picked up from the bakery.  How big a party are we talking? Satan, we can't possibly do- Oh boy, a Halloween party up on Earth. Hehey, everybody. Check out Hitler.  I can't believe he got the entire W Hotel. This is going to be the best Halloween ever.   Let's go. Yeah, let's go! Halloween has always been a time of evil and darkness. But now it appears that Satan will literally be among us. He is bringing Hell here to Los Angeles, and from what we understand, the gathering is going to be... completely off the hook.  Yes, hello? It this the fire department?  Damn your evil heart, Satan!! The Fire Marshal is at the party! Satan invited him! That's it! One way or another, we're crashing this party! In the name of Christ, just let us in! None? Satan mocks us. His party must be stopped. Yes, we cannot let evil take over our city, even for a night.   Tomorrow night, after all of Satan's guests have arrived, we'll call in a complaint about how many people are there. We'll see how long Satan's party lasts... after the fire marshal shows up. What? What the fuck is THIS?! Hey!  What about valets? Ha, how will people be arriving from Hell? Oh yeah, P Diddy had his birthday party here a couple years back and ''he'' had one of those. Diddy did do it. Diddy did it. Diddy didn't do it. Demonius!  Demonius, we have a problem! The Ferrari cake! It isn't here! It was never delivered to the hotel. What do we do?? It's midnight. The Ferrari cake never arrived! Buut we're probably gonna want security at the dimensional vortex gate. Hear me, demons! Lord Satan has demanded a Ferrari cake! Now I will take charge of Halloween, and call upon the spirits of Hell's most evil souls! Ted Bundy!  You shall rise once again to walk the earth, for tomorrow is Halloween, and I need you... to pick up Satan's Ferrari cake, and deliver it to the W Hotel! Heed my words: Satan's entire Halloween depends on this Ferrari cake. Fail, and you will know his greatest wrath! No problem.  All right, this is the place. Now remember, you numbskulls, this Ferrari cake is really important for Satan's party, so don't louse it up!  We're here to pick up the Ferrari cake. We got that flatbed.  Gacy, you numbskull, what'd ya kill him for?! Give me that!  What's the matter with you?!  Take this! You nincompoop!  That was the baker!  Siddonw!   You idiots! Now who's gonna help us load the Ferrari cake onto the flatbed?! Gacy!  Whatcha do that foor?! For Dahmer? Dahmer! Stop havin' sex with them intestines!  Cut it!  Oh no!  What's the matter with you?! It's ruined! All right, listen you mugs! It's now 11:30. That means we only have twenty minutes to bake a new Ferrari cake. Yeah? Why'd you quit? Get over here!  All right, what's the recipe call for first? Gacy, go get ten thousand eggs.  Shut up! Oh! Ohh, wise guy, ey?  How's that? AAA! Try that again! Shut up!  We can handle it.  Who's lousing? Ow. He startled me. Ohhhh...  What good are intestines if you can't have sex with them? There.  We're gonna get it now. No problem! It just so happens that I went to an Italian cooking school. There weren't enough Italians to eat.  Ten thousand eggs. Hey! Leave him alone!   Nehhh!  You punkass fool! Why'd you summon me? You'd better have a good reason, sucka!  Damn! Every Halloween I gots tuh ''deal'' with this shit! I'm in hell, mindin' my own business, and the next thing I know, I'm in some kid's bafroom.  You don't understand, fool! I ain't missin' the party! I already got my wristband, see?  You've got to get me to Los Angeles! How, punk?! We don't use money in here, ni**a!  This is your fault, homie! ''You've'' gots to get me to that party in L.A., or i'm gonna ''smoke'' your ass! Yo dawg, keep it down. Oh no! YOU summoned my spirit, YOU're gettin' me all the way to the party! As long as I get to the party in time to party, everything'll be all right.  Oh, God-damnit!   Not as sorry as you're ''gonna'' be, if I completely miss the party! Yeah, I'm just gonna be pissed if I miss-  What the? No! No! Motherfucking God-damnit! Cool this, sucka!  What the-? I am soo sick of this! Wait, I'm at the party.  And it's not too late. Hey, why don't you come in with me?  Ehhhhhhh. This is terrible!  Ladies and gentlemen: a fully edible Acura cake!  Acuras are really nice.  Satan, don't be so hard on yourself. You're not as bad as they are. Can I help you? Ohhh yes, it's just about finished. What kind of truck are we loading it up to? Okay well, we're just gonna need to- GYAAAH!   Oh! I'm a victim of circumstance.  Nyuk nyuk nyuk nyuk nyuk nyuk nyuk.  Oh! I did it for Dahmer. Yeah. He likes havin' sex with dead bodies.  Leave him alone!  Unh! Mmm, Ferrari. Nyak nyak nyak nyak nya-eh  Nyaaa nyaaaa You get 'em! Nyaaaaa!  GAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! What happened?? Everything all right?  Bwa! Gaaaghaghaghagh!  Satan's trickery knows no bounds! Hey, Satan, you got a little problem. Somebody showed up in a Crocodile Hunter costume. It's really offending some of the other guests. Wow, what a jerk. But it's me, Satan. Steve Irwin. I ''am'' the Crocodile Hunter. Wait! I thought we were friends!  What is it? What?? Don't even ''tell'' me that! Deva! Fetch my Blackberry! That Ferrari cake must get here by midnight!   We did the best we could; there was a problem. It doesn't matter. Your guests are having fun. They don't care. Oh!  This is a really extravagant party, Satan. Uh, these aren't the right wristbands. Uh, yes they are. Then how come they say "Knott's Berry Farm"?  Here you go, flight 72 to Los Angeles boarding in 10 minutes. He can't do it, he can't do it. All right, be quiet.  I wonder what this is going to be. Come on, Helen. Let's just go back to hell. I'm suddenly not so hungry for Acura cake. Look, kid, for the fortieth time, pacing in front of the store isn't gonna make the Wii come any faster.  Welcome to Zeebod's Toys Ahh, the Crank Prank Time Phone. Sure. Now, I am required by the state to make sure you know this is for prank-calling the past ONLY, right?  This is a pretty advanced piece of equipment. It's expensive. Oh, all right, then I ''have'' to have 6000 credits.   Sorry, kid, you're just gonna have to crank-call people in the present. Hey, kid, somebody's on the phone for you. Principal Victoria, we are a devout Catholic family! Do you mind telling me why my daughter now thinks she's a retarded fish-frog?! I told you this would happen, didn't I?! I hear ya. Well, I told you. We should leave evolution out of the classrooms. Re-replaced?? Shut up, faggot! Principal Victoria, I can teach my own class! We have worked years to instill the teachings of Jesus Christ into our daughter, and in one fell ''swoop'', you try to destroy everything we did! You most certainly will! No you don't! Shut up!  But Dad, I want to learn everything.  Charmed to meet you. Ms... Over billions of years life has evolved from simple one-celled organisms into all the complex life we see around us.   It was changes in hereditary traits that allowed the first mammals to breath in the air.  Ms. Garrison, I believe that's a gross over-simplification. You see, children, life has the amazing ability to change, to adapt. Like changing us to the point that we walk upright.  Well yes, basically, we are. Ms. Garrison, this isn't theory, it is scientific fact! Actually, no. Because I'm an atheist. I never covered it up. What on earth are you doing??  AAAH! Principal Victoria, I really don't think that's necessary. This woman is very opinionated but, she does care about her students. Ms. Garrison. Ms. Garrison, could I have a word with you, please? Look, I know you think we're at war, but I want you to know I admire your passion. I've never met a woman with so much... fire So much boldness in a woman. So beautiful.  I'm sorry, I'm sure you have a husband, but I- Would you then... consider having dinner with me tonight? Oh, Ms. Garrison, you are the most outspoken woman I have ever met! It's almost like you're one of the guys. You have so much spunk, so much life... If only you were an atheist. Why is someone as outspoken as you given themselves over to the whole God thing? Well what if I told you there was a flying spaghetti monster: Would you believe it simply because it can't be disproven? Really?? Oh that's ''won''derful! You're so welcome! Oh Ms. Garrison! You must understand, children, that we are dealing with VERY large numbers here. So, evolution doesn't even happen by chance. It is, in fact, bound to happen. Careful darling. The school board doesn't like it when we- Ms. Garrison, I'm not so sure what you did in class today was right. Yes, but to be so bold about it...  I've just never seen a woman with such... balls. Can you imagine a world with no religion? No Muslims killing Jews, no Christians bombing abortion clinics. The world would be a wonderful place... without God. Oh, just let me see those beautiful breasts again. Oh yeah, baby! Oh-hm.  Oh Ms. Garrison! I'll tell them... to call you back... Oh... yeah...  Garrison residence. Can you call... back later, please?  An emergency? I'm sorry, but Mr. Garrison has passed away. ''Mrs.'' Garrison is the only person here and she's rather tied up at the moment. Sex-change operation??  Uuuuugh! You're a man?! Explain?? How can I be so stupid??  We have a pulse.  Please be careful. You are frail. Young man, you don't seem to understand.  Your family, your friends, everyone you knew, has been dead for over 500 years. It's rumored that there's one at the Museum of Technology at New New Hampshire. Lots of people froze themselves in cryogenic labs and we don't unfreeze them. But you... are special. We believe that somebody you knew in your time was the person who first started our wonderful group: The Unified Atheist League. Oh no! It's the United Atheist Alliance! Yes. Long ago we realized isms are great for those who are rational, but in the hands of irrational people, isms always lead to violence. Can you... understand me? My name is Shvek. You are safe. My friend, this is going to be a bit of a shock, but... it is the year 2546. You have been frozen in ice for over 500 years.  We don't play videogames in our time. There's no such thing as a Nintendo Wii. Eric, I have good news for you. We may have found you a Nintendo Wii. Well, there's just... th-there's something we need from you first. You see, my young friend, you were unfrozen for a reason. You lived in a time when a great event happened. A glorious event that finally made all religion obsolete. Now, the entire world is atheist. What in Science's name was that?!  Oh Science, help us!  The Alliance Atheists. We're at war with them.  Hahahaha, you believe in a supernatural being.  No! Our answer to the Great Question is the only logical one. Our Science is great.  Prepare all the troops! We will level the United Atheist Alliance to the ground!  What are you otters doing?! This is our attack! Unified Atheist League is the most logical name. So be it. We cannot agree; prepare to die.  All right, Eric. Are you all set to go? Atheism? No. We've learned to get rid of all the isms in our time. We unfroze you for a purpose, and now that purpose is fulfilled. We explained that to you already.  Ahh, Nintendo Wii. A primitive gaming device used in his time.  Come on, Professor Chaos! Let's destroy this anthill!  Okay.  ...Yeah. ...Like, you die. Well yeah. If you freeze your body, it means you die. When you wake up three weeks later you can be unfrozen, but you're still dead. You just left him here?! Without a jacket or anything?! He's dead for sure. Oh my God...  We have to get out of here! Nobody is ever going to find his body. You've got to never say anything about this, do you understand?! He's dead, and if they know you had a hand in it, you'll go to jail!  Come on, we have to leave!!  Science damn you, Unified Atheist League! Put me through to the Allied Atheist Allegiance! Look, Allied Atheist Allegiance! We have the time child! Now you see, foolish sea otters, that we are the atheists in control!   Onscreen. Science damn you, United Atheist Alliance! It won't make a difference! This is the dawning of the sea otter! Know this, time child! I shall smash your skull like a clam on my tummy! Otters! The time has come! Sound the nafferty!  So, it begins! The nafferty!  Whoa, steady!  Something is spooking the ostriches. Here it is! We have arrived. It was a trick! Yes!  The great Dawkins said we cannot tolerate those who don't use reason! How reasonable is it to eat off wood instead of your tummy? Kill the table-eaters! In the name of Almighty Science!  This is it. New New Hampshire. We have risked much bringing you here, Time Child.  Don't let the time child out of your sight. He could try to run. It's the Wise One  The old museum of technology, abandoned long ago. Let's get what you want, Time Child, and get out of here. All right, Time Child, we've filled our side of the bargain. Now return with us to Otter Bay. NOOOO! SCIENCE DAMN YOU, TIME CHILD! The United Atheist Alliance has taken the bait! Soon they will send their ships out to destroy our decoy clam fields! And while their ships are away, the United Atheist League intends to attack them! Our plan has worked perfectly! For when the United Atheist League attacks the United Atheist Alliance, we will charge in and kill them all! Our Science, our answer to the Great Question shall prevail! And I will personally kill the Time Child, and eat his entrails on my tummy!  Wise One, our answer to the Great Question is the only one based on good science. They are not a logical race, Wise One! They go around chopping down trees for tables, when they have perfectly good tummies to eat on. How logical is that?!  Yes. And we're attacking both of you! Then accept our answer to the Great Question, and we will withdraw. No! Allied Atheist Alliance! That way it has three A's! That is the logical choice!  Don't worry, my son. When you return to your time you will merge with your other self. It's all very Zen. Of course there's war. The stupid French-Chinese think they have a right to Hawaii. Time Child! You've returned! TC, wait!  You gained the otters' trust?! Were you wearing an information crystal?! You've done a great thing, TC.  How can we repay you? Fellow atheists: the time child has returned with information on our sworn enemies, the Allied Atheist Alliance. They have started digging for clams in sector J7. If we mount an all-out attack, we can wipe out their food supply! We cannot tolerate the otters! Their Science is flawed! Their answer to the Great Question is different from ours. ...That's why we have to be super-duper sure that nobody finds out we're doing it. My friends, the time has come! May Science give us the courage to do what we must! Launch all defensive ships to sector J7! Take out the otters' clam fields!  The United Atheist League is bombing the city! We're defenseless! What?! Three-way phone channel onscreen!  You fools! This will be the end of us all! Your answer to the Great Question is illogical! >Unified Atheist Alliance makes more sense.  W-we told you: we're sending you home. With the Crank and Wank Time Machine. But now the moment has come to send you back to your time.  So long, Eric. And tell everyone in the past for us, that no one single answer... is ever the answer.  We thought for sure you had died in the in the Phobart plant. Science be praised. This could end the war! Uhh, what kind of output does this have? This is some ancient Super-VHS output or somethin'. I can't connect it to your float screen. It may be the future for you, but I can't hook up anything to a float screen without at least a laser-7 output.  TC? What's wrong? Well, we're all glad you're back. I know somebody who's missed you very much. Come on in, K-10.  TC! We're under attack! We have to get to the War Room! It's the only safe place! Bark bark. Hello, Eric. I have missed you. Why does it matter? Bark bark Bark bark. That call is for crank calling only. Using it in the way you describe is illegal. Working, bark bark. The Jarvanian shopping complex. But it is not open yet. Bark bark, I'm sorry, Eric, bark bark. Awww. Working, bark bark. Access. Working, bark bark. Bark bark. Hello, Kyle. Bark bark. But, those are civilian otters. Yes, but... sending out all our ships at the same time... it would leave our city exposed!  The United Atheist Alliance is about to send out all its defense ships to take down the Allied Atheist Alliance's clam fields. Praise Science. This is your chance, young Shvek, to avenge your father's death. Careful, son. Just because their Science leads them to a different answer to the Great Question doesn't mean we have the right to kill them all. Hey, I know! Let's crank call people in the past! I just got...  ''Crank Prank, Crank Prank Time Phone.'' ''Crank Prank, Crank Prank Time Phone.'' I just dial a random number on the keypad, enter a date and year on the debilibrator, and... Store is now... open.  Welcome Hail Science! Hail Science! Hail Science! Uh yes, hello? I'm calling for Mr. Wall? Oh. Is Mrs. Wall there? Then how does your roof stay up?  No, we're from the future.  Yeah. Oh. Okay, I guess. Science H. Logic! What a jerk! Hi, uh, I'm a Pepper, and I'm wondering if you'd like to be a Pepper too? That was a great one!  Hey!  Silence, otters! This is not the path we should be taking. Will more bloodshed end anything? Science, reason, is that really all there is? Well perhaps the great Dawkins wasn't so wise. Oh, he was intelligent, but, some of the most intelligent otters I've ever known were completely lacking in common sense. Maybe, some otters do need to believe in something. Who knows? Maybe, just believing in God makes God exist. What?! Whoa, wait wait!  The Wise One speaks. Kill the Wise One! Kill the Wise One!   Are you there?  All right, all right, listen! Listen to me carefully! You need to be patient! It's me. Me you! I'm you in the future! You have to be patient and wait for the Nintendo Wii to come out, or else you'll wake up in the future and have to deal with a bunch of see otters! It's not Kyle, it's you! I'm trying to do you a favor, dumb-ass!! Just listen to me!  What an asshole! Butters? Butters! Butters, Butters! Listen to me! Just just listen. I'm about to come over to your house and ask you to help me freeze myself. Do not... do t! No! This is not a joke! Whatever I say to you, Butters, no matter how hard I try, do not... do... what I tell you!  No! Don't listen to me! Tell me to go screw myself! Aw dammit, just listen to me! If you freeze yourself, you're going to die! No, you suck my balls!! Just listen to me for one minute! Right before you left for Butters' house, you drank a buncha Ovaltine and put Clyde Frog in the closet so nothing would happen to him, right? No, I ''am'' you, you stupid asshole!  God I hate that guy!! Hello? Kyle? Yes. Hello, Kyle. It's Eric. Uh, how's it going? Kyle, you are the smartest guy I know, so I think maybe you're the only person who can understand this. You know how earlier today I asked you to help me freeze myself? No, see, I ''know'' it's a stupid idea. Because, I actually ''did'' freeze myself.and... you were right, Kyle. It backfired and I was frozen for 500 years, and now I'm calling you from the future. No, really, Kyle, I'm I'm seriously. Here, talk to my robot dog.  No, Kyle, listen! Please! I think right about now, I'm in my mom's freezer. ... I will. I will suck your balls, Kyle. Just stop me from freezing myself, and I will get down on my knees, and I will suck your balls. I'll suck 'em dry, Kyle.  Kyle?  Kyle! Well I don't notice anything different, KIT-9! Do you?  Hey! Heeeeey! By who?! Hello? Hello? I know what you're thinking! Do not do it! You just need to be patient and wait the two months! Do you hear me?! Sir! The United Atheist Alliance has sent out all their ships. Their capital is now unprotected.  Then begin the attack! Science be praised.  Eric, I really think you should stop calling the past. You could change the present. I guess not, meow meow. Meow meow.  Meow meow. What atheists should call themselves. But Eric, meow meow, you knew the wife of the smartest man in all of history. Your teacher, the one called Garrison. Sir! The sea otters are advancing! They've broken through the east portal! Forward missiles launched, sir! Goodbye, Eric. I will mess you. Squawk squawk  Being a delivery boy for the South Park Gazette is a noble privilege. Oh waaa waaa waaa! We've all got problems, pussy! Get used to it!  You aren't delivering the papers on time!  'Cause it's being towed. Yes? Come in. Yes! Come on, Mr. Marsh. I've been told all about your case. Impounded bicycle, $83 owed to the county. Maybe you should get a job.   Well, I'm afraid I can't give it to you, because then you wouldn't learn anything.. Whoa whoa, hold on. I've looked your case over and I think maybe we can cut a little deal here. According to your background check, when you were in kindergarten, you played on the Park County Pee Wee Hockey Team. Well it just so happens that the pee wee hockey team this year needs a coach.  And now, he's about to find out that to coach, you've got to grow. Stan Marsh has always lived a carefree life. But in the blink of an eye, what seemed important before can all be put in perspective. Stan Marsh is... "Bummin' on Cancer."    Stan Marsh! Stan Marsh! Great news! Our hockey team has just been invited to play against Denver County during a Colorado Avalanche game!   Who are you? Are we gonna get cancer if we play with Nelson, Coach? So did we kill Nelson or not? Coach, I have to go potty. ...By myself? Nelson has leukemia. It's already spread to his bone marrow. Oh no. No, 'cause they're gonna kill us. AAAGH!  What does "passing" mean? Coach, why do people get cancer? Oh no! Adams County!  Our coach isn't gonna let us lose! Oh Jesus, no! If we lose are we gonna get cancer? They look pretty strong, coach. I think Nelson's gonna die for sure.   My mommy said I'm as big as the sky. Ohhh.. EEEK-ugh  Coach, Morgan spit on my foot! No, he has cancer. I don't wanna be a murderer! We can't beat Denver County. No. In the movies, they always go out and find a kid who's really good to join the team. I did not! Well well well! If it isn't the Park County Losers!  We just thought we'd come check out the ice for the game tomorrow.  Gavin Throttle, coach of the Adams County team. Look, why don't you just give up? You can't beat us. You really want to embarrass your players?  Fine, if that's the way you want it. See ya tomorrow, coach! Adams Team! Come to surrender, coach? HA! I don't think so, Coach. We're gonna beat you into the ground, cancer or no!  Win! Win! Win! Win! Good luck, Coach! You're gonna need it!  Yeah! Let's go Adams! That's it, Brian! Kill him!  Yeah!! Yeah! Yeah! We came to play. Right! Follow!   Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! ... Coach, please don't let us lose to Adams County. My daddy will beat me again. Sooo, if we lose we're gonna kill Nelson? I don't want cancer. Coach! What the hell were you thinking? Last time we played Denver they scored seven times. That's what Steve Irwin said about those stingrays. Wow, he's good.   Coach? Hey coach.  Our little Nelson, he's... taken a turn for the worse, I'm afraid! His cancer is... real ba-a-a-ad.  Yeah. Oh. Doctors say this could be it. How am I supposed to do it, coach? How do I look a five year old child in the eye and tell him he's not gonna live?  You tell me, coach! You tell me how!!  I don't know what to say to him, coach. Neither of us do. What do you say tuh... somebody who's dying, huh? Will you talk to him, coach? He looks up to you. Nah, I'm just his father. But you're his coach! You're like a father to him.  Please, coach, he's counting on you! Stop it, Jack! He doesn't mean to take it out on you, coach. Please, coach, he's...  he's counting on you! Oh no! We need a Canadian.  Oh, hello Coach. Well, he isn't worse, but, he isn't getting better. It's almost as if... his cancer were tied. He seems to have put all his hope into you winning that game. And with a tie, he's in a kind of... cancer limbo. Look! He's coming around again.  Just be aware of this, Coach. If you lose the Big Game, that little boy is going to die faster than Steve Irwin in a tank full of stingrays.  Sorry boys, you aren't playing tonight. The other Pee Wee hockey team didn't show up. There's nobody for you to play. Thanks for makin' the trip though. No. Nobody wins. Well, you've got nobody to play, there's nothing we can do. Well, who are they gonna play? Hey, hold on a second. If these kids have been through a lot of emotional changes, then they ''have'' to play. They can take our place. All right! Give 'em hell, boys! Yeah. Yeah. Let 'em play the Red Wings. All right! Yeah! OHHHHHHHHH! Let them play! Let them play!  Red Wings! Red Wings! Red Wings! Red Wings! Red Wings! Red Wings! Red Wings! Red Wings! Red Wings! Red Wings!  Yeah! We did it! We did it!  Thank you, Dad. I'm proud of you, boy.
