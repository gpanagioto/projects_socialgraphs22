Not yet, but Tupac is close to hunting him down. Sir, I get that you brought this YouTube commentator in because he's popular with the younger kids, but now he's trying to tell us what the show should be called??  If I may be frank, sir, I think you're giving this kid a little too much power! Stand by on camera 4. Boost the live Twitter feed. Aaand cue the hash tag! How are we trending?  We're trending at 64%, sir.  We're trending well? That's impossible. This isn't part of the holiday special! What is he doing?! We can't, sir!
