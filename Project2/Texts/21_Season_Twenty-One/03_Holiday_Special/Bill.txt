I've never felt so alive until now. I wrote you a song to express my feelings for you.  And then he kissed me.  And then he kissed me.  And the sun began to shine. Randy, I cannot quit you. Uuugh!  I want you to stop running from yourself. We could be so happy.  But Randy, what about the- Yes. Yes, I understand. I brought my parents over so you could meet them. Don't worry. My parents are very okay and cool with us. Randy, you must face who you are. Stop pretending, Randy. For once, just allow yourself to feel.
