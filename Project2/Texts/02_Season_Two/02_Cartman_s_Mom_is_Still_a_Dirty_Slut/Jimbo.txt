It's a power outage! Hey! This window is shot out, too! That means the killer was not someone in this room! There's a murderer free in South Park. We have to find out who it is before they kill again. What are we gonna do, Mayor? This killer is on the loose! Mayor, shouldn't we be focusi-- Holy smokes, that blizzard is getting crazy! Well,  we're not going anywhere for a loong time. I hope you all realize what we might be facing here. Our only option might be to... ''eat'' each other to stay alive. That's the law of land, Mr. Director. It ain't pretty, but if a few of us must die so the rest can stay alive, so be it. Well, we draw straws. Calm down, soldier! We need every person here to keep his head! Barbrady, fetch some straws. Alright. So far, everybody has a long piece of straw. We'll keep drawing.  Whew. Wait a minute! Where the hell is the short one? Dammit, Barbrady! When you draw straws, you're supposed to have one of them ''short''! That's how you decide who loses! We have to have the energy to make it through the night. We have to eat. There's only one answer: eat Eric Roberts.  God wants you to live, Mayor. Fight! What time is it, Barbrady? We'll give the storm another hour. After that, we might have to eat again. It ''is'' amazing what people can do under stress. Just look at the pyramids. Nobody knows how they built those, or who. Listen, everybody. We did what we had to in there.
