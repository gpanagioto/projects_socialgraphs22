What do you want?! Well I don't know, Eric. NO! I'm not doing anything for you! You're a traitor! Yeah! Boys and girls were at war, but you go and kiss your little girlfriend's ass! Whatever happened to sticking with your kind?! Because girls drove us to break all your stuff, dumbass! If anyone should be pissed at chicks, it should be you! But no, you got your bitchy little girlfriend pullin' your strings now! Oh God, listen to you!  Traitor!  How dare you be ashamed of who you are?!   What? Well, I'm just angry, Mr. Gentleman. I'm tired of girls saying boys need to change. Somebody has to stand up for our rights!  No. The end? Of what?
