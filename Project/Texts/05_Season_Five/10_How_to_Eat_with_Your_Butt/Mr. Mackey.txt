Okay Eric, as your counselor, uh I want you to feel comfortable talking about anything, m'kay? Well, I can't think of anything that would be THAT funny. Oh, I see, well... Well, what did you ''used'' to think was funny? Well Eric, I suppose that, just like everything else, laughter can be relative - in, in other words, sometimes people see somethin' so scary that nothin' else scares them, so, the same could be true for funny things. It's possible, hm'kay? . Ohokahay, huhuh.
