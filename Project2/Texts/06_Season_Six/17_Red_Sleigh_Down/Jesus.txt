  Stan, Kyle, Mr. Hankey and Eric Cartman. What are you doing here, my children? Santa? Is he alright? We have to get him out of there. Yes. Yes, I think I do.  Lock and load! We're goin' in! He must be in that building below us. Land it on the roof, Mr. Hankey.  Wait here, I can handle this. Yay, look upon me, and know me. My children, you should know something.  Here.  Can you walk? They are healed.  Santa... Let's move. Move!  You're a... bad liar.  Hey. B-but we sure gave them one hell of a fight, huh? Uh Santa? Don't... don't ever... let them take away... our... Christmas spirit.
