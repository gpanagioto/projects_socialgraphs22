Children, children, we have a very special announcement.  Tolkien is going to sing in front of a huge audience at the Miss Colorado Pageant in Denver. And for doing it he's gonna be paid two hundred dollars. Now of course, as a woman, I'm a bit against those chauvinistic pageants, but I hope that you children take a moment today to congratulate Tolkien for being so special. Just between us girls, nothin' gets my vadge wetter than a black man singing.
