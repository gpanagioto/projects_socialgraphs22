==Fictional character biography==
[[File:Anne Weying.png|thumb|upright|left|Anne Weying on ''Rune vs. Venom'' #1 (December 1995). Art by Greg Luzniak.]]
Anne Weying was a successful [[lawyer]], and [[Eddie Brock]]'s ex-wife. In her first appearance, she is a brunette with glasses. In later appearances, she loses the glasses and goes blonde. Weying assisted [[Spider-Man]] by sharing some of Eddie's history. She later followed Spider-Man to the amusement park where Venom had Peter Parker's (fake) parents. She confronted her insane ex-husband, and managed to convince Eddie to give up this [[Feud|vendetta]]. Later, [[Sin-Eater (comics)|Sin-Eater]] shot Anne to which the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] symbiote temporarily bonded with her to save her life.<ref>''Venom: Sinner Takes All'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> She-Venom then lashed out against the men who had hurt her with such [[violence]] that Eddie was afraid for her and compelled the Venom symbiote back. Anne retched upon seeing the pile of bodies she had left behind, claiming that the Venom symbiote had made her kill her victims, but Eddie told her that the Venom symbiote wouldn't force its host to do something they did not want to.<ref>''Venom: Sinner Takes All'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> 

Weying is later incarcerated by the police on a false charge (unrelated to Anne's previous rampage) in order to trap Venom. Anne used her one phone call to warn Eddie and to promise not to come. Eddie agreed not to rescue her himself, and instead sent the Venom symbiote through the phone lines to her.<ref>''Venom: Along Came a Spider'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> After the Venom symbiote bonded with her, She-Venom was able to break herself out of prison, heading to the amusement park where she and Spider-Man had confronted Venom, only to intercept a raid on a gang of drug dealers.<ref>''Venom: Along Came a Spider'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> During the fight, Eddie was badly injured by a flamethrower, prompting Anne to release the Venom symbiote to heal him, but also to leave Eddie in disgust at his dependence on the Venom symbiote.<ref>''Venom: Along Came a Spider'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> 

Still reeling from the experience of bonding with the Venom symbiote months earlier and unable to deal with Eddie's return into her life, coupled with her ex-husband's transformation directly in front of her as Venom ran off to kill Spider-Man, sent her over the edge. Weying commits [[suicide]] after spotting Spider-Man webslinging in an older black costume at a time when the regular red and blue suit had been stolen. She leapt from her high rise apartment to her death.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #19. Marvel Comics.</ref> Her death is later confirmed when her tombstone is shown.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #22 (October 2000). Marvel Comics.</ref>

In a flashback, it is revealed that she got pregnant with Eddie's child after bonding to Venom. After giving birth to their son Dylan, she left him in the care of [[List of Marvel Comics characters: B#Carl Brock|Carl Brock]], with the promise that she would return eventually. She instead committed suicide, after which Carl raised Dylan.<ref>''Venom'' vol. 4 #12. Marvel Comics.</ref> It is later established that Anne was already pregnant with Eddie's child when she last bonded with the Venom symbiote, with the codex that was left inside Anne by Venom (apparently) being absorbed by the fetus.

===Venom Beyond===
During the "Venom Beyond" storyline in Donny Cates' Venom run, Eddie and Dylan are transported to a different universe where the villainous Codex has been conquering the Earth in the name of Knull. While on the run from symbiote-possessed Avengers, the two run into a group of symbiote heroes led by '''Agent Venom''', who reveals herself to be this world's version of Anne. Unlike the 616 universe, Eddie goes through with committing suicide at the church. Anne was shocked and distraught at her husband's death and eventually goes to the same church to mourn him, where her rage attracted the symbiote and transformed her into this world's version of Venom. She eventually gives birth to Dylan, who was eventually swayed by Knull and became the villainous Codex. To counter Codex's threat towards the planet, President Eugene Thompson recruits Anne into the Sym-Soldier program, where she leads a group of symbiote heroes consisting of Peter Parker, Wade Wilson, a reformed Cletus Kasady, and Andi Benton.<ref>''Venom'' vol. 4 #28.
