Dude, what the fuck? Uhh, excuse me, why are you doing this??  What? Well what did she say? Why are the Asian girls drawing pictures of us being gay? But we aren't! I'm not! But I'm not gay! No, you may not! Got a fuckin' problem, man?!  I told you to stay a hundred yards from me! Goddammit! Is Tweek home? No, thank you, I just want to see Tweek. Hey dude.  Tweek, calm down. We have to put a stop to this. Me too, dude! But there's something we can do. We have to come out and say we're gay. Wait. Wait! Because if we're gay, we can break up. And if we break up, no more pictures! We just have to stage a fake breakup in front of the Asian girls. You can do it, Tweek! You're capable of more than you think. You just follow my lead, and try and make it believable, okay? Hey, Tweek! Hold up. Listen, it's just not going to work.  I'm sorry, Tweek, but we can't lie to ourselves anymore.  Yes, we are gay, but we do not belong together. It's just that people are different. That's all. What? What are you, what are you talking about? Wait, uh, that's, that's not what happened. No.  Uh, look, we both know this is for the better. Wait, don't make me out to be the bad guy here.  You're going too far, dude. This is like, totally not necessary. This wasn't part of the plan! Dude, seriously? Seriously? What do you want? Dude, I'm not gay and neither are you! You think you can just pull that shit you pulled at school, saying I step on people and use them?! And I'll just take you back? Not that real! Now everyone thinks I'm a manipulative cheater! I'll never get any chicks! I can't be something because everyone wants me to be. I have to be myself. You'll just have to go be gay with someone else.
