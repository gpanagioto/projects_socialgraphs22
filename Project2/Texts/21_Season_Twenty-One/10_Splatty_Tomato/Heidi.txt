..."The President?" [Her and Cartman walk up with their bikes] I saw him too. He had a blue suit and an orange face. He kept asking me "How are my ap..." You're not going. You promised that tonight, we would have a date night. Oh great. So Kyle's stupid brother goes missing, and I get fucked. How come I'm always the one getting shit on around here? Oh what's the matter, Kyle? Don't want me around because you had the hots for me and I shut you down? This is the place... This is the place where I ended it all, remember? This is where I threw my phone of the bridge and quit Twitter for good. [The camera pans to the left to show Heidi's ghost] I was so different then... so naive and hopeful. [The ghost throws the phone in the river after tweeting her final goodbye] I'm sorry! I'm trying to have a moment here! This is where our whole relationship started asshole! [The ghost turns to face herself] I remember feeling like I had nobody. Skinny bitch. Wait a minute... Isn't this the place you brought me before? The place you said your friends smashed your phone and computer...? I remember I felt so bad for you. We used to sit in the part and talk for hours. How come we never do that anymore? Here we go what?! You used to be so nice to me. I tried! But then you started rolling your eyes every time I tried to talk to you! I remember this place too... This is where you brought me on Halloween. Remember? No! It wasn't romantic. There was a witch and you had me dress up like Gretel and... [gasps] you were trying to get me killed! ''You'' were hurt! ''You'' Were the victim. [Heidi's ghost appears] ''Who turned you into this, Heidi?'' Shut up! Skinny-ass bitch! You don't know anything! [Heidi grabs White's gun] You piece of shit! This was all your fault! [She points the gun at Cartman] You controlled me and manipulated me and turned me into this! I used to be kind. I used to be caring. But then you... you... No. Not you. Me. I did this. I let being a victim become a way of life. If you always make yourself the victim, you can justify being awful. Eric... I'm sorry. I'm breaking up with you. I've been ridiculous. I have to learn to stop feeling sorry for myself. Yes, I am. It's over. It's not gonna work this time, Eric. I'm sorry. You can be the victim. I can't.
