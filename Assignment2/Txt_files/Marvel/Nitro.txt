==Fictional character biography==
'''Robert Hunter''' was born in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]]. He was an electrical engineer. Due to genetic alteration carried out on him by the Kree Lunatic Legion, Robert gained the ability to explode and reform himself at will and became a professional criminal. Some time later, he exposed [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Captain Marvel]] to a carcinogenic [[nerve gas]];<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #34</ref> this encounter ultimately caused Captain Marvel's fatal cancer.<ref>"The Death of Captain Marvel"</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=166}}</ref> Since then he has clashed with Earth's superhumans, who have found creative ways to defeat him, including using the "fractioning (separation) of his exploded mass" against him (essentially, if he can't reform himself after an explosion, he can't explode again).

Nitro later battled and was defeated by [[Omega the Unknown]].<ref>''Omega the Unknown'' #8</ref> He later escaped from [[Features of the Marvel Universe#Project_Pegasus|Project: Pegasus]], and then battled and was defeated by [[Spider-Man]].<ref name=autogenerated1>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #55</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Manning |first2=Matthew K. |title=Spider-Man Chronicle: Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging |date=2012 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-0756692360 |page=119}}</ref> Nitro was later freed from his containment canister by the [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]] in Albany, New York. He battled [[Skids (comics)|Skids]] of the [[New Mutants]], and was unable to re-form his body within Skids' force field.<ref>''The New Mutants'' #86</ref> He was then recruited by [[Thanos]] to serve him in a mission alongside several other supervillains,<ref>''The Secret Defenders'' #12</ref> including [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]], [[Super Skrull]] and [[Titanium Man]]. When the mission ended with the [[Silver Surfer]] rescuing the Earth-based villains, Nitro decided to take a space craft and explore space.<ref>''The Secret Defenders'' #14</ref>

Much later, when the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] was plotting his return to the New York underworld, he hired Nitro as one of many assassins to launch a carefully planned simultaneous attack on several New York crime bosses, including [[Don Fortunato]], [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]], Caesar Cicero, [[Silvermane]], and many others; Nitro's target was [[Norman Osborn]], who emerged relatively unscathed.<ref>''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' #95</ref>

One such appearance where a foe took advantage of his limitations was in ''[[Iron Man (comic book)|Iron Man]]'' vol. 3 #15, where he was hired to kill Tony Stark. A fight occurred between Nitro and Iron Man. Iron Man, whose sensors and telecommunications gear had been recently upgraded, noticed that every time he exploded, a high-frequency pulse was emitted by his body. Experimenting, Iron Man duplicated the pulse, causing Nitro to explode. After he exploded several times in a minute, he passed out from exhaustion (presumably, it takes energy to explode, and he could only spare so much before he passed out). Iron Man then handed him over to [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], along with a recommendation on constructing a null-harness. He was sent to prison.<ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 3 #15</ref>

On another occasion, when Nitro's lawyer had him released from captivity, the villain immediately escaped, attempting to rob a bank for money to travel to [[San Francisco]] to kill Captain Marvel. He was opposed by Spider-Man, who defeated Nitro by webbing a barrel of [[tear gas]] to his body right before he exploded. As Nitro reformed, the suddenly evaporated tear gas mixed with his own molecules, leaving him violently ill and unable to fight back. Again, Nitro was arrested and sent to jail.<ref name=autogenerated1/>

Later, Nitro is hired as a [[hit-man]] to kill [[Matt Murdock]]. He almost succeeds, killing several innocent people. [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] and the police work together to capture him.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #26</ref>

At the start of the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' storyline, the [[New Warriors]] performed a videotaped raid of a house containing the [[Cobalt Man]], [[Speedfreek]], [[Coldheart (comics)|Coldheart]] and Nitro, who had recently escaped from prison during the [[Ryker's Island]] [[the New Avengers (comics)|Incident]]. The New Warriors attacked each villain, with [[Namorita]] (the [[Namor|Sub-Mariner]]'s cousin) going after Nitro. Slamming him into a school bus, Namorita taunted Nitro who then quotes "Oh, baby, don't you even know? You're playing with the big boys." Nitro then explodes causing a massive explosion. This explosion killed Namorita, [[Night Thrasher (Dwayne Taylor)|Night Thrasher]], [[Microbe (comics)|Microbe]], and the supervillains he was with during the raid along with sixty children at the nearby elementary school and some 600 people in the surrounding neighborhood in [[Stamford, Connecticut]] where the fight took place.<ref>''Civil War'' #1</ref>

Nitro escaped in the back of a pickup truck and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] soon began hunting him.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 3 #42</ref> Eventually Wolverine and a group of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents caught up with Nitro. The agents perished in the battle.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 3 #43</ref> Atlantean agents show up and capture Nitro for Namor and Wolverine follows them to New Pangea in an Iron Man armor to find Nitro has killed his interrogators in an attempt to escape.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 3 #44</ref> Wolverine captures Nitro and slices off his arm before leaving Nitro a prisoner of Atlantis.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 3 #45</ref>

Namor used Nitro in the destruction of New Pangea after moving his civilization to [[Latveria]], a nation ruled by [[Doctor Doom]].<ref>''[[Sub-Mariner]]'' #6</ref> Nitro was held prisoner in Latveria until Penance brought him back to America after forcing him to suffer for the Stamford explosion, leaving him in critical condition and close to death.<ref>''[[Robbie Baldwin|Penance - Relentless]]'' #2</ref><ref>''Penance: Relentless'' #5</ref>

Nitro later popped up as a member of [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]'s crime syndicate when they stole a treasure from an Arabic diplomat and then had a celebratory party were the Hood shows them how he's the leader and the ways he delegates the job.<ref>''Dark Reign: The Hood'' #1</ref>

Nitro later appeared at a party in Madripoor that was held by [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]].<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 2 #304</ref>

Nitro was among the villains that fought Spider-Man on a submarine.<ref>''Marvel Knights: Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #3-4</ref>

During the ''[[Avengers: Standoff!]]'' storyline, Nitro was an inmate of Pleasant Hill, a gated community established by S.H.I.E.L.D.<ref>''Avengers Standoff: Assault on Pleasant Hill Alpha'' #1</ref>

During the "Opening Salvo" part of the ''[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]'' storyline, Nitro is recruited by [[Helmut Zemo|Baron Helmut Zemo]] to join the Army of Evil.<ref>''Captain America: Steve Rogers'' #16</ref> Nitro is among the villains on a rampage after what went down in Pleasant Hill. During his fight with the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], Nitro defeated them by exploding.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #0</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
As a result of genetic re-engineering by the Kree, Nitro can transform his body into a gaseous state, explode, and reconstitute himself. The transformation and explosion to can be limited to discrete portions of his body, such as his fist, and aim the force in a specific direction. While in his gaseous state, he cannot reform if any fraction of his body is separated from the rest, and he must completely reform his body from a gaseous state before he can detonate a second time. The reforming process does not have any healing properties, so any wound received prior to the explosion will be present when he reforms.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 3 #45</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
Nitro appears in the ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]'' episode "Time Bomb", voiced by [[Liam O'Brien]]. This version is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|Mutant]] desperate to keep his destructive abilities from hurting anyone due to his lack of control over them. In pursuit of his quest, he willingly accepts confinement within suspended animation in a mutant prison run by the [[Mutant Response Division]] (MRD). However, [[Toad (Marvel Comics)|Toad]] discovers his capabilities and informs [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], who leads the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]] in freeing Nitro so they can use his powers for their own benefit. During his time with them, Nitro is kept under control by [[Betsy Braddock|Psylocke]]'s telepathic powers and forms a connection with the sympathetic [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] due to her own uncontrollable powers. While transporting him to [[Genosha]] as an offering for [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]], the Brotherhood are intercepted by the [[X-Men]]. During the ensuing fight, Nitro almost kills both teams, but [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] suspends him in midair so he can detonate safely. After [[Wolverine (X-Men)|Wolverine]] explains they would have destroyed Genosha if the X-Men had not intervened, the Brotherhood begrudgingly allow Nitro to be returned to the MRD.<ref name="Time Bomb">{{cite episode|title=Time Bomb|series=Wolverine and the X-Men|network=Nicktoons|number=8|airdate=March 6, 2009}}</ref>
