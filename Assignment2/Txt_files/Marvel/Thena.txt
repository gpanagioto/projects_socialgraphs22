== Fictional character biography ==
=== Beginnings ===

Thena was born in the city of [[Olympia (comics)|Olympia]] in ancient Greece, and is thus one of the Eternals of Olympia. Originally named Azura, but her father [[Zuras]] had her name changed by royal decree to resemble that of [[Zeus (Marvel Comics)|Zeus]]' daughter '''[[Athena (Marvel Comics)|Athena]]''' (Roman name Minerva) to seal the treaty between the Olympian gods and the Eternals, in which the Eternals would act as the gods representatives on Earth, with Thena serving as Athena's personal representative. Due to this, she has often been mistaken for Athena and Minerva. The city of [[Athens]] was apparently built for her, not the goddess, although Thena later allowed it to be conquered by the [[Sparta]]ns in 404 B.C.

Thena became a scholar and a warrior as she grew. She encountered [[Kro (comics)|Kro]] in [[Babylon]] 2,500 years ago. He had a chance to slay her, but did not; as the years passed, the two of them grew closer together. Thena and Kro made love during the [[Vietnam War]], resulting in Thena becoming pregnant with twins. She placed them inside of Ms. Ritter, an infertile woman, who raised them as her own twin children, [[Donald & Deborah Ritter|Donald and Deborah]].<ref>revealed in ''Eternals: The Herod Factor'' #1</ref>

=== Modern Age ===
In recent times, the eternals and deviants revealed themselves to the human world. When Warlord Kro led his armies in an attack on [[New York City]], Thena opposed him to help rescue [[Sersi]]. Thena was reunited with Kro, and publicly declared herself to be an Eternal.<ref>''The Eternals'' #5</ref> After Kro called a truce, he brought her to the Deviant city of Lemuria to try to resume his relationship with her. However Thenas was horrified with the Deviants' customs including the mass killing of ''undesirables''. Thena meet Brother Tode, the leader of the deviants and watched a gladiator match between Deviant champions.<ref>''The Eternals'' #6-7</ref> She watched that [[Ransak the Reject]], a genetically stable [[Deviant (comics)|Deviant]] was fighting the horribly mutated but well-mannered [[Karkas (comics)|Karkas]]. Thena was convinced by [[Karkas (comics)|Karkas]] to grant both of them sanctuary and take them under her protection, running away from Lemuria with them. She then participated in the [[Uni-Mind]] with other Eternals to decide what to do with the Celestial crisis.<ref>''The Eternals'' #8-12</ref> With Karkas and the Reject, she battled Zakka and [[Tutinax]].<ref>''The Eternals'' Annual #1</ref> She met and became an ally of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]],<ref>''Thor'' #285-289</ref> and then battled Athena of Olympus, during a battle between the Olympian gods and Eternals.<ref>''Thor'' #291-292</ref>

She and the rest of the Etenals were captured by the Deviants aristocracy, but were rescued by Iron Man (James Rhodes). Thena was contacted by her father's spirit and proposed to the Eternals the need of going to the space.<ref>''Iron Man'' Annual #6</ref> She then formed the Uni-Mind again, to decide the matter and battled [[Maelstrom (comics)|Maelstrom]] alongside the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]; she was chosen by the Uni-Mind to stay on Earth.<ref>''The Avengers'' #246-248</ref> After Zuras' death and the subsequent departure of most of Earth's Eternals, Thena became [[Prime Eternal]] (leader of the Eternals of Earth), but she was traumatized by her father's death and was being subtly influenced by a Brain-Mine Kro had placed upon her. Thena was angry when few eternals assisted to her crowning ceremony.<ref>''Eternals'' (vol. 2) #1</ref> In a new conflict with the deviants, Thena meet Kro again and helped him to escape from High Priest [[Ghaur]]'s control.  She thwarted the other Eternals' efforts against Kro and turned against [[Ikaris]] to help save Kro's life, but later relinquished her title to Ikaris after a ceremony, and was banished. She was captured with Kro by Ghaur, and freed from Kro's brain mine; when she learned of the Brain-Mine, she was furious with Kro. She battled Ghaur alongside the Eternals, Thor, and the [[West Coast Avengers]].<ref>''Eternals'' (vol. 2) #1-12</ref><ref>''Eternals: The Herod Factor'' #1</ref>

Some time later a maddened Dr. Damian transformed [[Ajak]] into a monster through the use of Celestial technology, sending them to kill Thena and [[Kro (comics)|Kro]]'s twin children, [[Donald & Deborah Ritter]]. The monstrous Ajak killed many sets of twins along the way. After the Eternals restored Ajak to their true form, suddenly grief-stricken with the deeds that committed as a monster, Ajak committed [[suicide]], additionally disintegrating Dr. Damian himself. Thena was reunited with her children and Kro, forming a family.<ref>''Eternals: The Herod Factor'' #1</ref> Thena then sent Gilgamesh to help the Avengers, and later helped the superhero group in the fight against Proctor and his Gatherers.<ref>''The Avengers'' #374-375</ref> Kro and Thena searched for their children when they were captured by the villain Maelstrom.<ref>''The Avengers'' #370-371. (1995) Marvel Comics.</ref> When the mad priest Ghaur tried to form an ''Anti-Mind'', he captured the twins and Thena. Kro led his deviant faction to rescue his children and his lover, with help of the [[Heroes for Hire]]. However he was outmatched by Ghaur's power and kept up the fight as his family escaped.<ref>''Heroes for Hire'' #5-7. (1997) Marvel Comics.</ref> Later, Thena and the rest of  the Eternals had to fight Apocalypse and posed as a superhero group.<ref>''The New Eternals: Apocalypse Now'' #1, 4-6</ref>

=== Memory loss and Aftermath ===
In the 2006 ''Eternals'' title, Thena began as normal woman married to Thomas Eliot with a son, Joey, and a researcher at [[Stark Enterprises]]. Like [[Sersi]] and [[Makkari (comics)|Makkari]], she was affected by [[Sprite (Eternal)|Sprite]]'s reality warping to have no memory of her past as an Eternal.<ref>''Eternals:'' (vol. 3) #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Thena assisted at a Vorozheika party organized by Sersi. In the party, the amnesic eternals were attacked by mercenaries of another faction of Vorozheika government, killing her husband. The reunion of four eternals triggered a recovery of their powers.<ref>''Eternals:'' (vol. 3) #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> With their returned powers, Thena frees herself from the mercenaries that captured her. Afterwards, she began to suffer terrible nightmares in which she was indeed immortal, and fought off various multicolored Deviants with ease. When she awoke from one of these dreams, she found she had gained back her costume and powers.<ref>''Eternals:'' (vol. 3) #3-4. (2006) Marvel Comics.</ref> The Eternals, now remembering their past, arrived to San Francisco to deal with the Dreaming Celestial.They realized that they cannot stop the Celestial (they are programmed to protect him) and  leave him be. The Eternals then embark on a quest to go and recruit the other members who have similarly forgotten their true selves due to Sprite's trickery.<ref>''Eternals:'' (vol. 3) #3-7. Marvel Comics.</ref> Thena remained one of the Eternals, keeping her (human) child with her in their home after a heated argument with Ikaris.<ref>''Eternals'' (vol. 3) #6</ref>

Thena kept caring for Joey and began to bicker with Ikaris for the method of awakening Eternals. She did not recognize that her son was host to a Horde' scout.<ref>''Eternals:'' (vol. 4) #1-7. (2008) Marvel Comics.</ref>

=== Death===
Later when the Celestials' Final Host arrived on Earth, Thena along with all the Eternals killed themselves after realizing the true purpose for which they were created.<ref>''Avengers'' (vol. 8) #4</ref>
