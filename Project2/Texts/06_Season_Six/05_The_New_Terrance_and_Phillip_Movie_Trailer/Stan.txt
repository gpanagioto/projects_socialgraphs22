 This is gonna be so awesome! Chips, pop, cookies, Kleenex, toilet paper, flares - we won't have to leave the TV room for anything! Alright, here we go. Shelly, we're watching that! Go back!  It's not the show we care about. During one of the commercial breaks of tonight's episode, they're gonna show the exclusive never-before-seen trailer to the new Terrance & Phillip movie! But all the other kids are gonna watch it and talk about it at school tomorrow. But Shelly, it's the Russell Crowe Show! You always said there's nothing you love more than Russell Crowe. Shelly, please, let us watch. We'll do anything. Anything!  O-K, deal.  Well, only one of us has to go to the store. The others can watch. Dude, I'm not going. Stan. Dude, why is this guy always beating everybody up? They look fine to me.  That's worse! Dude! Dude, the commercials could start any time! Get all the stuff!  We're going to Kyle's house to watch! Come on!  Hurry! We can't miss the commercials! Huff, huff Aww!  AGH!   Yeahyeah, how do you change the channels? We made it! Here they come! I knew it. I knew they wouldn't play it during the ''first'' commercial break. Dude, put it back, Chef. More commercials might come on soon.  Oh God-dammit! Come on, we gotta go somewhere else!  The bar! They've got a TV at the bar! We made it. But we have to watch the commercials in this show.  Commercial Break Number Two!  I knew it. They're waiting until the very last commercial break. Oh, God, it's horrible!  We have to go to Butters' or Cartman's house! We have nowhere else to go! Well, screw it! We'll watch it in your house even if it '''is''' being fumigated! Turn it on! Turn it on! Me neither. I'll be dead before the commercials. Wait a minute! I forgot there's a black and white television back at '''my''' house! She has to!  Hurry! The commercials will be on any minute! What? The last commercial break has to be coming any second!  We've tried everywhere! Butters, are you absolutely sure we can't go to your house?? Come on, let's just go! We'll kill Butters later!  We made it!  Jesus Christ, how long is this commercial break gonna be?? Wait a minute! Look!  "The following preview has..." This is it! This is it!
