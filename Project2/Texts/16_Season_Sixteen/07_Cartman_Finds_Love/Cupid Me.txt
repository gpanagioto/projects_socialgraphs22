 We did it, Eric. We found them each other's ray of sunshine. Teeheeheehee.   Teehee, that was us, remember, Eric? Teeheeheehee, teehee.  Teeheeheeheeheehee. They're fudgey charms of sunshine. Teeheeheehee, teeheeheeheehee.  Teeheehee, no!   Teeheehee. Looks like somebody could use a little arrow of sunshine. No, you don't. No, you don't.  Teehee, stop it. Teeheehee, teeheeheehee,  teeheeheeheeheeheeheeheehee. Teeheehee, a place for everything, and everything in its place. That's right, and I found somebody who's just the same as you! There she is!  Teeheeheeheehee, fuck you!
