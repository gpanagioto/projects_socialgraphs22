Nothing. Yeah. I uhhh, have band practice. Fuck you, Brad Pitt! I'm good. Okay, really? ...What jury?  I don't know what to say. This isn't a poem. It doesn't even rhyme. Can I go back to class now?  You think I should feel bad for you because of the Trayvon Martin verdict?! What the hell is wrong with you?! Why are you all here listening to this?! He's just out looking for trouble. You made everyone think I'm a fucking Patient Zero! So what?! Fuck you! Oh!  An apology?! He shot me!  Well it's a pretty fucking stupid law! And why does standing your ground not apply to fucking white people?!
