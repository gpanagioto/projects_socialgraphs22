 Hello, children. Ready for lunch? Eric, is there a problem? "Stinky Britches" by Alanis Morissette? Children, did you say hi to Mr. Twig?  I told you never say his name in my presence. It just so happens that Mr. Twig is far more stable than Mr. Hat could ever be, so he's the better puppet now--  How dare you! Come on, Mr. Twig. Mr. Twig, is that you? Mis-Mr. Twig? Aagghh!! Mr. Twig! No! Who did this to you, Mr. Twig?! Who?! I need some help over here! Please help! I think he's got third-degree burns!  Is he going to be all right, doctor? Is he going to live? ...Dammit, don't give me that medical jargon! Just tell me straight, is he going to be okay?! I brought you some more juice, Mr. Twig. Are you feeling any better?  Mist-Mr. Twig... are you okay? Mist-Mr. Twig..? Aaaggghhh!! Who did this?! You won't get away with this, you bastards! Thank you for coming, Officer Barbrady. These pictures just arrived.  Now, go arrest him! What? Yes—Yes, I’m sorry.  It can't be. These can't be right. Mr. Hat! Did you think I would just take you back? Like you can just, walk out and then, come back like nothing happened? Oh, don't look at me like that, Mr. Hat. Remember, you're the one that left. I'm not going to take you back. You can just go to hell! You go to hell and you die! You are a lying bowl of turd, Mr. Hat! ...I hope you starve, you lousy son of a bitch! What are you all looking at? This is just between me and Mr. Hat. What do you mean? What? Jail? ...And Mr. Twig is at home, he has no idea Mr. Hat is even back. I mean, I care a lot about Mr. Twig, but Mr. Hat and I have so much history. What?  I warn you, Chef, don't even think of taking advantage of me in this prison cell.  You're still aren't entertaining ideas of raping me in this prison cell, are you, Chef? That's good. Oh, boy, we're free! Wow, what a daring rescue. Mr. Hat! Mr. Hat saved us, Chef! Come on, let's get in the truck! I'll drive from here, Mr. Hat. Don't worry, Mr. Twig. Even though Mr. Hat rescued me from prison, I'm still going to stick with you. It doesn't matter. He left me. Yes. But I feel like I'm making the wrong decision. I'll never forget you, Mr. Twig. Thank you.
