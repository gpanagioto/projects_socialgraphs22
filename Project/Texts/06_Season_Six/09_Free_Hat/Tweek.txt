Don't you see what this means? All our favorite movies are going to be changed, and updated, until we can't even recognize them anymore. NO! Nono, ah I don't wanna form a club! That's too much pressure! Look, ah-I'm supposed to take it easy; just, watch the clouds, sit on the grass. And, if we form a club there'll be responsibilites. Commitments! I'm not! I'm not a team player!  D'oh-ho! Oh Jesus! But we don't ''have'' hats! Aahh! You see?? First we were just forming a club, now we have to make hats! When does it end?? Fifty hats? Oh Jesus!  Ah! I'll never make it! I'll never make it!   Hrrr! My center. My... center.   Gaaaaah! Oh God! Aaaah! Oh God!  You guys, we have a big problem! I was up, all night, making hats. I only slept for an hour, ...and then I ''dreamt'' about making hats, but I only made fifteen! A thousand?  Oh Jesus man! I don't have nearly a thousand hats! Goohoo!  Oh God! I gotta move away, you guys! Oh! Jesus! Don't tell them it was me! You don't? What?  You guys! You guys! Oh God! Um, I've got terrible news! Ted Koppel wants us to appear on ''Nightline'' to talk about our cause. No it isn't, man! Thahat's ''waaay'' too much pressure! Ga-ahah! Gaaarh!  Oh, Jesus, man! ...N'ahah! Ahah. U-uh. It's easy? Oh Christ! Wwwaaaaaaah! Get me out of here! Please, somebody get me out of heeerre! No! That's it! I'm out! I can't deal with the stress you guys create!  Hwaaah! Haaah!  I'm not breaking into George Lucas's house. I'm not breaking into George Lucas's house. I'm in a green field. I'm in a field... surrounded by deer. Huh uh. Guh huh huh!  Oh God! Oh Jesus!  Aaaaaah! Oh God, no! Not Plan B!   Aaaahh!  Members, uuhh, oh Jesus, uh, we have to do something! Our club president  have all been taken hostage by Steven Spielberg! Haaa!  Yes, just like Hat!! No! Listen to me! We're not talking about Hat right now, okay?! Gad!! Look, we went to George Lucas's house a-and tried to melt his icy heart with a warm island song, but then Spielberg showed up and took three of our members prisoner! They're goin' to premiere their new ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'', and we ''have to'' rescue them! Do you understand?! No! Oh God. I'm gonna have to do this myself. Oh God! Hello! I'm gonna blow up the print, Spielberg!   That depends on how reasonable we're all willing to be. All I want are my friends. Except for Cartman - you can keep him. Then your premiere has no movie! Ah, what?! Oh my God! But what about the original prints of ''Raiders of the Lost Ark''? What if somebody else takes them and tries to change them?
