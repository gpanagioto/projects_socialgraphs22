'''Aquagirl''' (also '''Aqua-Girl''') is the alias of several [[fictional character]]s appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]], depicted as the female counterpart to [[Aqualad]] and the junior counterpart of [[Aquaman]]. Originally, the first two incarnations of the characters, Lisa Morel and Selena, were introduced as one-off characters in one-off stories.<ref name=":0">[http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=15369#4 "Aquaman Meets Aquagirl!" ''Adventure Comics'' #266] (November 1959). The Grand Comics Database.

The mainstream version of the character, '''Tula,'''  first appeared in ''[[Aquaman]]'' #33 (May–June 1967) as the third incarnation of the character. Originally one of Aquaman's partners, the character also served as a love interest to [[Aqualad]] and was a member of the Teen Titans until being killed off in the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' in 1985, being succeeded by a different incarnation of Aquagirl. After the [[The New 52|New 52]] reboot, the history of the character was retroactively changed with Tula being the sole character to be referred to as Aquagirl. Unlike prior depictions, '''Tula Marius''' is the half-sister of [[Ocean Master]] and does not actively use the Aquagirl codename. Tula has also been portrayed as a high-ranking commander of a [[Black operation|Atlantean-based covert black-ops faction]], a [[regent]] for Aquaman's administration, and a [[Guard of honour|honor guard]] during Mera's administration.<ref name=":3">{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1253363543 |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia |date=2021 |first1=Matthew K. |last1=Manning |first2=Stephen |last2=Wiacek |first3=Melanie |last3=Scott |first4=Nick |last4=Jones |first5=Landry Q. |last5=Walker |first6=Alan |last6=Cowsill |isbn=978-0-7440-2056-4 |edition=New |location=New York, New York |oclc=1253363543}}</ref>  

Several incarnations of Aquagirl has appeared in media, including both the Tula incarnation in ''[[Young Justice]]'' and ''[[Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox]],'' although she is not identified as her codename in both versions. Original incarnations of the character appear such as Mareena, the future daughter of Aquaman and Mera present in the ''[[Batman Beyond]]'' series.

Garth sees through the ruse, is able to defeat Slizzath and finally gain a sense of closure about Tula's death. It is also at this time that Garth adopted a new identity as "Tempest".

==In other media==
===Television===
[[File:AquagirlJLU.jpeg|thumb|Mareena in [[Batman Beyond]] (left) and in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' (right).|300x300px]]
* Aquagirl appears in ''[[Batman Beyond]]'', voiced by [[Jodi Benson]]. The character, named '''Mareena''', is a member of the future Justice League and the daughter of Aquaman. The character was created specifically for the two-part episode "The Call", in which the future [[Batman (Terry McGinnis)|Batman]] (Terry McGinnis) meets the future version of the Justice League and is amongst the members to be cordial with him alongside [[List of Green Lanterns#Kai-Ro|Kai-Ro]] while [[List of DC Comics characters#W|Warhawk]] and [[Big Barda]] are mistrustful of him. When Batman is going over her file on the computer, it is shown that she is the daughter of Aquaman, with powers including control over water. She later reappears in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' series (which showcases the present-day lineup of the [[Justice League Unlimited (team)|JLU]]) in "[[Epilogue (Justice League Unlimited)|Epilogue]]" alongside Terry, Warhawk and Kai-Ro in Terry's imagination fighting the Iniquity Collective. She has very distinctive platinum blonde hair; it is always wet and slicked evenly back. Her costume varies; she is usually portrayed wearing a one-piece swimsuit of various colors with bare arms and legs and fingerless gloves.
* In the [[Entourage (season 2)|second season]] of ''[[Entourage (U.S. TV series)|Entourage]]'', [[Mandy Moore]] portrays Aquagirl in the Aquaman movie that exists in the ''Entourage'' fictional universe. The storyline has Moore, playing herself as the ex-girlfriend of character Vince, about to be dropped from the project due to the turmoil of their personal relationship. Mandy is not removed from the movie however, and Vince and Mandy re-kindle their former romance. Following this, Mandy breaks Vince's heart again, stating that she still loves her former fiancé, Chris. Vince decides to continue working on the movie with Mandy still attached. It then becomes the highest-grossing movie opening of all time.[[File:AquagirlAnimated.jpg|thumb|Tula as she appears in ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]''.]]
* Tula (though she is never referred to as Aquagirl in the first season) appears in ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'', voiced by [[Cree Summer]]. She is portrayed as the childhood friend of [[Aqualad (Jackson Hyde)|Kaldur'ahm]], who ultimately entered into a relationship with his friend, Garth, after Kaldur left Atlantis to become Aquaman's sidekick, Aqualad. Unlike in the comics, the Tula in the series possesses mystical powers that can help her create, control and manipulate water into any shape she wishes, powers that many Atlanteans have, undergoing training from [[Mera (comics)|Queen Mera]]. When Kaldur returns to Atlantis for a dinner with the royal family, he invites Tula as his guest, unaware that she has already left him for Garth. She eventually tells him about this and the two reconcile during an attack on the city led by [[Black Manta]], with Kaldur departing on friendly terms when he eventually returns to the surface world. Tula and Garth make a cameo appearance in the episode "Failsafe", working alongside [[Roy Harper (comics)|Red Arrow]], [[Rocket (DC Comics)|Rocket]] and [[Zatanna]] in a training simulation. In the second-season episode "Alienated", it is mentioned that Tula's death (during the events of the video game ''[[Young Justice: Legacy]]'') is one of the reasons Aqualad has apparently turned on his former team (while actually going undercover to investigate the Light's [[Reach (comics)|partner]]) In "Satisfaction", her statue is among the other yellow statues of fallen heroes located in the grotto of Mount Justice. In "The Fix", Tula appears as a psychic projection when [[Miss Martian]] and [[Artemis Crock]] psionically enter Aqualad's subconscious mind.

===Film===
* Tula makes a cameo appearance in ''[[Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox]]'' as a member of Aquaman's army in an altered timeline. They battle [[Deathstroke]], but are overpowered. She later is killed in the final battle with the [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazons]].

===Video games===
* The Tula incarnation of Aquagirl, appears in ''[[Young Justice: Legacy]]'', voiced by Cree Summer. She serves as the coordinator of the Team, providing information on the Light's attempts to steal the pieces of an ancient statue, and keeping the pieces safe. Near the end of the game, [[Klarion the Witch Boy|Klarion]] disguised as Tempest tricks her into giving him the pieces of the statue, and kidnaps her, intending to use her magic to revive [[Tiamat]] in Bialya. The team arrives to free Tula and defeat Klarion and [[Blockbuster (DC Comics)|Blockbuster]], but is too late to stop Tiamat's revival. When Tiamat proves too powerful to kill, a weakened Tula offers to use her remaining magic to defeat and imprison Tiamat again, sacrificing herself just like [[Marduk]] did in ancient times. Tula succeeds, but is killed by falling debris. Tempest grieves her death, and Aqualad quits the team, leading up to the events in the second season of the series.
