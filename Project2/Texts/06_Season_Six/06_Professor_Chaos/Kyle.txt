Who wants to tell him? Lame. But we certainly want to thank you for all your hard work and attempts at being our friend, lame as they were. We're sorry, Butters.  Our mind is made up. Phew. Hm, he took that pretty well, I think.  Tweek. Now there's an interesting choice. Tweek has a lot of qualities that I look for in a friend.  even though I can see how always having a towel around can come in handy, he's just always so high.  But right now I'd say if we're gonna have a retard for a friend, I, I have to pick Timmy. Because Timmy doesn't tell lame jokes.  Timmy. Pip. . Tweek. This looks pretty good. You're such a fatass, Cartman!  Tolkien. Timmy. Tweek.  Pip. Towelie. Jimmy. Anything that'll impress us, Tolkien.  Well Tolkien was a definite winner of the talent show. But then we decided to take everyone to a baseball game, to see how we got along there. Yeah! Isn't this great?! Towelie is cool, but he gets stoned all the time. You can't really rely on him for anything. Eh now,  come on, you guys, we can't take this decision lightly. Whoever we pick is going to be the person we do everything with from now on. So? ''You'''re a smartass! Good point.  Cool.
