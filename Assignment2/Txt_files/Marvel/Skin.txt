'''Skin''' ('''Angelo Espinosa''')  is a [[fiction]]al [[Character (arts)|character]] (a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|human mutant]]) appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appeared in ''[[The Uncanny X-Men]]'' #317 (October 1994).

==Fictional character biography==
Angelo Espinosa was a former gang member from the east [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] area who faked his own death to leave that part of his life behind. Skin was one of four young mutants (including [[M (Marvel Comics)|M]], [[Husk (comics)|Husk]], and [[Blink (comics)|Blink]]) abducted by the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]], a techno-organic alien race. The reason behind the abductions was so that the Phalanx could uncover the secret behind their inability to [[Assimilation (biology)|assimilate]] mutants into their collective. Through their combined efforts and those of [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], [[Emma Frost]], [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], [[Synch (comics)|Synch]], and [[Jubilation Lee|Jubilee]], the four young mutants managed to escape their confines; although, Blink sacrificed herself by using her powers to destroy the Phalanx that had captured them.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #317, ''X-Men'' #37</ref>

Afterwards, Skin accepted an invitation to enroll in the [[Massachusetts Academy (comics)|Massachusetts Academy]], a school for mutants owned by Emma Frost. As a member of [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]], Skin was joined by Synch, Jubilee, Husk, and M (and later by [[Jonothan Starsmore|Chamber]], [[Penance (X-Men)|Penance]], and [[Mondo (comics)|Mondo]]). During his stay at the Massachusetts Academy, Skin became close friends with Chamber because neither could pass for normal humans in public, and he always found time to playfully flirt with Husk, Jubilee (whom he nicknamed Jubecita), and M. Skin was also hunted by a mutant-killing vigilante known as the [[X-Cutioner]] who believed Skin responsible for the death of Angelo Espinosa. The X-Cutioner did not know that Skin, in fact, ''was'' Angelo Espinosa. Skin and Chamber succeeded in defeating the vigilante, but kept the secret.{{Issue|date=January 2010}}

During [[Operation: Zero Tolerance]], Skin and his teammates found themselves transported to his hometown by [[Glorian]].<ref>''Generation X'' #28</ref> While searching for Skin's cousin Gil, they were captured by Skin's ex-girlfriend Tores, a gang leader who wanted to kill him for making her believe he was dead. Before she got the chance, [[Prime Sentinel]]s attacked both Generation X and her gang, forcing them into a reluctant temporary truce. Skin and Tores acted as bait to lead the Sentinels into an ambush, and Gil completed the trap by starting a huge explosion, allowing Generation X to escape.<ref>Generation X #29–31</ref>

After the Academy closed due to the machinations of [[Adrienne Frost]], Skin returned to Los Angeles with Jubilee in tow. Some time later, Skin and Jubilee, along with [[Magma (comics)|Magma]], [[Bedlam (comics)|Bedlam]], and a handful of other unknown mutants were found [[crucifixion|crucified]] on the lawn of the [[X-Mansion]]. This action was done by the [[Church of Humanity (comics)|Church of Humanity]], a militant, religious anti-mutant organization. [[Warren Worthington III|Archangel]] used his blood's healing properties to revive Jubilee and Magma but Bedlam and Skin didn't survive.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #423</ref>

Jubilee, Husk, and Archangel went to visit Skin's grave after Jubilee had recovered only to find that the owner of the [[cemetery]] was about to dig Angelo up and remove him because of his status as a mutant. The girls argued with the foreman, but he insisted that it was against the religious convictions of the cemetery to bury mutants. He offered to [[cremation|cremate]] Angelo's remains and give them to the girls, which he ultimately did.{{Issue|date=January 2010}}

Skin was later resurrected by means of the [[Techno-organic virus#The Transmode Virus|Transmode Virus]] to serve as part of [[Selene (comics)|Selene]]'s army of deceased mutants. Under the control of Selene and [[Eli Bard]], he takes part in the assault on the mutant nation of [[Utopia (comics)|Utopia]].<ref name ="XFv3i22">''X-Force'' (3rd Series) #22, February 2010</ref>

Years later, Skin was resurrected on [[Krakoa]] through The Five, his resurrection pushed forward on the schedule because his former teammate [[Synch (comics)|Synch]] was needed to act as a back-up for The Five and they believed the two young mutants would help each over re-adjust.<ref>''X-Men'' Vol 5 #5</ref> He was seen arm in arm with Synch and standing next to Broo at a party following the first meeting of the Quiet Council.<ref>''House of X'' #6</ref> He was later approached by [[Madison Jeffries]] manifesting himself through the land, who explained to him that he was thrown in the Pit of Exile for trying to create a place for [[Danger Room|Danger]] to live, which was deemed a violation of rule three by the Quiet Council. He later told [[Blob (comics)|Blob]] about this, unsure if it really happened, Blob assures him he's seen enough weird things to believe his story and remarks there's going to be a power-vacuum soon and that "it's good to have a [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants|brotherhood]].<ref>''Sabretooth'' Vol #3-4</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Skin possessed approximately six feet<ref>Generation X #1</ref> of extra skin. He was capable of stretching, deforming, wrapping, expanding, and compressing this extra amount of [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]]. When Skin is performing any of these stunts, it is only the epidermis that was manipulated; Skin's [[skeleton|skeletal structure]] was the same as any normal, average person of his age and height. Skin's skin had a greyish tone and, because of the extra amount, gave him the appearance of a melted candle. At one point, along with compressing his skin tighter against his body, Skin was learning to manipulate the pigment [[melanin]] in his epidermis in order to appear normal. However, performing these two stunts together caused him to have [[migraine]]s and he soon gave up on the idea of being normal.

==Other versions==

===Age of Apocalypse===
In the alternate timeline of the [[Age of Apocalypse]], Skin was featured in ''Generation Next'' as one of the protégés tapped by [[Colossus (comics)#Age of Apocalypse|Colossus]] and [[Alternative versions of Kitty Pryde#Age of Apocalypse|Shadowcat]] to rescue [[Magik (comics)#Age of Apocalypse|Illyana Rasputin]] from enslavement at the [[Sugar Man#Age of Apocalypse|Sugar Man]]'s Core. Due to their more militant training, Skin was depicted as using his powers in a much more aggressive fashion, including [[impalement|impaling]] opponents with skin protrusions. Colossus abandoned the team to ensure Illyana's rescue, and as a result, only he, Shadowcat, and Illyana managed to escape from the Core. Skin and the rest of his teammates were overwhelmed and killed by the Core's guards.<ref>''Generation Next'' #4</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe it was mentioned by Sunspot that Skin had nearly been beaten to death by humans.<ref>Ultimate X-Men Vol 1 #48 (August, 2004)</ref>
