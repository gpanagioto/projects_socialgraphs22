 Come on, let's go try to get you pregnant again. Huh? Uh, I'll play catch with your later, son. Aw, alright. Well alright, here comes a pop fly. See if you can catch it!  Aw, he smacked me in the balls!  And he fixed my shattered left testicle, too! Well, ''I'' can still drink.  Ogh, that hits the spot. Makes me forget all about my shattered balls.  Who-o-oa. Oh, God, I'm gonna crap my pants!  Oohhh, God!  Are you sure you should be going on this thing? What did he say?  ...John Denver Experience. Oh, God, my nose! I think I broke my nose! Oh, I'm not gonna make it! I'm gonna be sick!  Oh my God, it killed Kenny! Kenny, what the hell are you doing?!  Kenny??   What the-? No, wait, no, WAH, NO, WAAAAAH!   Coo, cootchy-coo, coohoohoohoo, cootchy-coo. Oh, he's so beautiful. I know it's been hard on both of us losing poor Kenny. But this new baby kind of reminds me of him.  Well, seeing as though Kenny passed away, maybe we should name him ah,... Kenny. God, this must be the fiftieth time this has happened.
