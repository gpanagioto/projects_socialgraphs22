Yeah, my Uncle Jimbo says we gotta get up there early. Right, Uncle Jimbo? Maybe your mom can give me a kiss too, Cartman. Uh, Uncle Jimbo, we don't drink beer. You weren't in Vietnam, Cartman. Cartman always makes stuff up, Ned. You can't believe anything he says. My Uncle Jimbo says that after this, he's gonna take me hunting in Africa. Hey, it wasn't coming right for us. It was just sitting there. Wow, you're smart Uncle Jimbo. Is this hunting? I can't. I don't wanna shoot the bunny. I'm not hysterical, I just don't want to shoot the bunny. I can shoot ''you'', fat ass! I'll kill you! Yeah, Cartman's pee. Hey, I'm a dirty little bastard too. Whatabutt? Why? A hook. Celery? Cartman, you suck at telling scary stories. Maybe it's Scuzzlebutt coming to weave us into wicker baskets. What, dude? Where's my Uncle Jimbo and Ned? With Kenny? But, but this is supposed to be ''my'' camping trip. Why do they like Kenny so much? Doesn't he like me anymore? What? Uncle Jimbo, Cartman's missing! Yeah. Does it have Patrick Duffy for a leg? No! I can do it Uncle Jimbo. I want to bag that animal! I'm gonna bag Scuzzlebutt. Then we'll see who's the little bastard. Ah, damn it, I can't do it! Cartman? Whoa, he built a wicker basket. I did it, I did it, I finally killed something. Hey, that was easy! What?! Why?! No. But I just wanted you to be proud of me, like you were with Kenny. Yeah,  it's stupid. Let's go watch cartoons.
