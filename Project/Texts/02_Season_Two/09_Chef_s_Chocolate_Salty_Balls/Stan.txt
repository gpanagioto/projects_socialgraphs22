Hoohh, like ''Independence Day''? That sucked ass, too. Oh, my uncle Jimbo has a ''ton'' of those movies in his dresser drawer. She's ''not'' my ''girlfriend''. Damn, dude. Look at all these people. Whatcha doin'? Calm down, tubby. Shut up, Cartman!  When's this thing start? I hope there are some good previews. They what?!  Oh, brother. Dude! Dude! Aw, dude, you don't even wanna know! Yeah, pretty much. The theater sucks, though. They need to get a bigger screen. Yeah, but <i>that'd</i> be like IMAX. Are they good? Hey, dude, these ''are'' good! There is ''what'' again? Dude, how do you tell if a piece of poo is in trouble? To the sewer, dude. What was that? Mr. Garrison? What do you mean? Well, why don't you just ask them to leave? Well um, it ''does'' sound like a pretty sweet movie. Jeez, they made that into a movie already?  Serves you right, Cartman! You're a sellout! If you work in the entertainment business and you make money, you're a sellout! So what do we do now? Why?  Are you gonna be okay, dude? I'm here for you. Okay! Sorry. Aw, dude, ''I'' shouldn't be seeing this! Blaach! ''No'' problem, dude. What the hell is he doing? Oh, that's okay Wendy. I forgive you.
