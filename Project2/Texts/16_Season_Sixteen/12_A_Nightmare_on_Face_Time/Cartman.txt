We're actually on our way over to Kyle's because our costumes are so multi-faceted and cool we have to put them on together. Uhhh what are you supposed to be, Butters? Yyeah, really cool, guys. You'll be some stiff compettion at the costume contest for sure.  You'll just have to wait and see.  Stan can't come?! But he's fucking Captain America! This is fucking ridiculous! We've been planning this Halloween for two months, and Stan has to go and ruin it! Yeah, he looks totally fine, except that when we walk up to a house, people are gonna be like, "Oh wow, it's the Avengers, and some Captain FaceTime skateboard guy!"   I'm not Bruce Vilanch! The Incredible... No not Chaz Bono! Do you see my skin?! I'm green! The person I'm dressed as is not fat, and not gay!  That's right! Dude dude dude! Check it out.   You guys, we've gotta stop it! Cartman SMASH!   Holy shit, they shot this guy! Oh my God. You mean they don't know people can stream movies cheaper and more conveniently online? Hey, this means we can still make the costume contest, you guys!
