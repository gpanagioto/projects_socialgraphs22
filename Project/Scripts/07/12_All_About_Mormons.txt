South Park Elementary, day. In Mr. Garrison's classroom the kids enter and go for their desks.

Mr. Garrison

Okay, children, let's take our seats. [a blond boy stands to his left] We have a new student joining us today who has just moved here from Utah. I want you all to say hi to Gary. [Gary looks around. The kids don't say a word]

Gary

Hello everybody. It's really great to meet you all.

Mr. Garrison

Gary was state champion in wrestling AND in tennis. [Stan, Kyle, and Kenny look at each other] He also maintained a 4.0 grade point average at his old school AND has been on two national commercials for toothpaste.

Gary

I'm really excited to live in this town and share all kinds of great experiences with you, my new friends!

Kyle

[quietly, to Stan] Oh, dude, what a little asshole!

Stan

Yeah, screw that kid!

Mr. Garrison

All right, Gary, why don't you take that empty seat and we'll get started with the lesson? [Gary goes to the seat to Cartman's right as Cartman looks on with some trepidation. Once Gary is seated, Cartman lurches away from him about six inches]

Gary

[offering a handshake] Hey. My name's Gary.

Cartman

[falsetto] Hi. My name's Eura. Eura Fag.

Gary

[laughs] That's funny. You're cool, man.

Mr. Garrison

Okay now, who can tell me what year the first astronauts landed on the moon? [writes "Moon Landing" on the board]

Gary

[without hesitation] Oh! Oh oh oh! Nineteen sixty nine!

Mr. Garrison

Very good, Gary. Wow, looks like I don't have a class full of retards anymore, doesn't it, children? [writes "1969" on the board]

+++++


The playground. Gary is kicking a soccer ball around. The other fourth grade boys approach and look. Shown are Craig, Butters, Kyle, Clyde, Stan, Cartman, Tolkien, Kevin, and another boy

Kyle

Dude, that new kid is such a douche!

Cartman

Yeah. Somebody needs to put him in him place!

Butters

He's a peckerface, that's what he is!

Cartman

Go kick his ass, Stan.

Clyde

Yeah, go kick his ass.

Stan

Well, maybe he won't fight.

Cartman

Will he bleed? That's all we care about.

Kyle

Come on, dude, somebody needs to wipe that fuckin' smirk off his face!

Craig

Yeah, little bitch!

Stan

All right, I'm gonna go kick his ass. [leaves]

Cartman

Yeah! Go Stan! Go Stan! [then, when Stan is gone, softly] All right, I've got five bucks on the other kid. Who wants in?

Gary

[looks up as Stan approaches] Oh hey there! You wanna kick the ball around with me?

Stan

No. I'm... I'm gonna kick your ass.

Gary

Excuse me?

Stan

I'm gonna kick your ass... [glances back] bitch.

Gary

How come you wanna fight me? ...Oh, I get it. I'm the new kid. [sigh] Yeah, I guess maybe I deserve it.

Stan

[off guard] Huh?

Gary

It's really tough being in a totally new place, but I think all you guys are really cool so... I understand if there's initiation rites.

Stan

Dude, stop it.

Butters

[back in the crowd] Let him have it, Stan!

Stan

Shut up, Butters!

Gary

The other kids are watching. Look, do what you gotta do. I won't fight back. I just hope that maybe afterwards we can... try to be friends someday.

Kyle

[back in the crowd] What are they doing?

Cartman

They're just standing there, talking. [A few moments later, Stan returns defeated. He glances back at Gary, then approaches the other boys]

Kyle

What happened? [Stan glances back, then looks at Kyle]

Stan

I'm... [stares back at Gary] going over to his house for dinner tonight.

Tolkien

What?! How did that happen?

Stan

[stammering] He's a really nice kid.

Cartman

You were supposed to kick his ass, not lick his butthole!

Kyle

You're having dinner with his family? What kind of family has a kid like that?

+++++


Gary's house. His family is enjoying itself at the dinner table, playing a board game, "LIVING", and laughing.

Dad

Okay, my turn. [turns a little wheel] Ooo, five! [moves his piece] One two three four five. Uh, awww, lost your mortgage, pay ten thousand dollars! Oh no! [they all laugh. Gary and Stan enter]

Mom

Hey, it's Gary!

Older sister

Gary!

Older brother

Great to see you!

Mom

How are you?

Gary

Hey everybody! This is my new friend Stan. Stan, this is my mom and dad.

Dad

Hi Stan!

Mom

It's so nice to meet you.

Gary

[the camera pans to the older brother] And this is my brother Mark.

Mark

Hi!

Gary

[then to the older sister] My sister Jenny.

Jenny

Hey!

Gary

My little brother Dave.

Dave

Hi!

Gary

And my baby sister Amanda.

Amanda

[removes her pacifier] Hello Stan!

Dad

Well, it's great you could join us for Family Home Evening, Stan!

Stan

What's that?

Gary

That's when we don't allow any TV and just entertain each other with music and stories. Doesn't your family ever do that?

Stan

No.

Dad

Hey kids! Why don't you grab your instruments and play a song for Stan!

Jenny

Oh yeah!

Mark

All right! Let's play! [the kids grab their instruments. Jenny and Gary take guitars, Mark takes a trumpet, Dave takes the drums, and Amanda takes the little piano. The kids launch into song]

Gary


Yeah yeah, yeah, I love my family!
My family is the best!
If we ever have to face a challenge.



The kids

My family!

Gary

Can pass the test. [the parents bounce softly to the beat. Next scene, the family is back at table for dinner. Mom comes in with a big turkey platter]

Dad

Oh boy! Who is the best Mom in the world?? [the rest of the family chatters. Next scene shows Dave juggling three balls]

Mark

All right! Go Dave!

Gary

Yeah!

Jenny, Mark

Woohoo! [next scene is Mark doing Shakespeare's "Hamlet", with skull]

Mark

Where be your gibes now? Your gambols? Your songs? [next scene is Amando in Russian dress, dancing]

The Family

Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! [next scene, they're all laughing at something]

Mark

That's a great story, Sarah.

Dad

All right, kids, now how about we do some Scripture readings! From the Book of Mormon!

Mark

All right!

Kids

Yeah!

Mark

Woohoo! OOWW!

Stan

The... Book of Mormon? What's that?

Gary

You know... the book that Joseph Smith found.

Stan

Who's Joseph Smith? [they laugh at his ignorance]

Mark

Only the most important person in the world.

Jenny

You've never heard of him?

Stan

No!

Gary

Tell us the story of Joseph Smith, Dad.

The other kids

Oh yes, tell us Dad. Yeah Dad. All right.

Dad

All right, you rascals. Gather round. [the kids draw closer to their dad] Joseph Smith lived in a little American town in the early 1800s.

+++++


A little American town in the early 1800s. A man rides by in a small carriage pulled by one horse. In the distance, Joseph Smith strolls into town.

Singers


Joseph Smith was called a prophet
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
He started the Mormon religion
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb



Blacksmith

There goes that kooky Joseph Smith.

Customer

You know, he claims he spoke with God and Jesus.

Woman

Well, how do you know he didn't?

Singers


Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
Joseph Smith was called a prophet-



Butler

Hey, Joseph! I told my wife that you spoke with God and Jesus, and she didn't believe it.

Smith

Well it's true. I did.

Wife

Where?

Smith

I was out in the woods, praying [a shot of him on his knees in the woods] I was asking God if I should be a Protestant, or a Catholic, or what? And suddenly God and Jesus appeared before me. [a bright light appears before him and he shields his eyes from the glare] And they said I should start my own church, because none of the others had it right. [the flashback ends] And that's exactly how it happened.

Butler

You see? You believe it now?

Wife

Well yeah, sure. Why would he make that up?

Singers


Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
Many people believed Joseph
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
And that night he-ee saw an angel
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb



Smith

[in bed inside a shack] And please bless Mother and Father, and please keep our bellies full of yum-yums and luscious goodies. [a flash of light and a glowing orb flies around the room] AAAHH! [the orb turns into an angel] Oh my gosh!

Angel

I am Moroni. I am a Native American.

Smith

A... [looks at the camera] Native American? [looks at Moroni] But your skin is white.

Moroni

Yes. Long ago all Native American were white. We all came to America from Jerusalem. And while we were here we were visited by Christ.

Smith

[looks at the camera]  Jesus live here in America?

Moroni

Yes. Eventually, my people were all killed by the other tribe of Israel, and as punishment, God turned their skin red. These are the Native Americans you know today. [Smith looks at the camera dumbstruck]

Singers

Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb

Moroni

There is an ancient book buried near here, written on gold plates that account my people's lives. Also buried with the book are two seer stones, the Urim and Thummim, which will allow you to translate the writings. Find it, and fulfill your destiny. [brightens and then vanishes]

Smith

Wooww... [gets up and dressed. He exits his shack]

Singers


Joseph Smith was called a prophet
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb



+++++


Back to the present.

Dad

And we all know what happened then, don't we?

Kids

Yeah! I know!

Stan

What happened then? [a small timer rings]

Mom

Ooo, the Rice Crispy squares are done!

Kids

Rice Crispy squares! Yay! All right! Rice Crispy squares!

Dad

Hey gang, let's wrap some more of them up in plastic wrap and hand them out to the poor!

Gary

Awesome! I can't wait!

Jenny

Yeah! [the family rises from the couch and leaves]

Gary

You coming, Stan?

Stan

No, I was supposed to be home at eight.

Dad

Awww, that's too bad. Well, it was really nice meeting you, Stan. [the family returns and hugs Stan]

Mark, Jenny

Bye Stan!

Mom

Great to meet you!

Gary

Bye!

+++++


Stan's house, night. What a contrast. Randy watches TV on the couch with beer in hand, Shelly watches it on the floor, Sharon watches it from the dining table solving crossword puzzles. Stan enters upon this desolate scene.

Stan

...Hello?

Sharon

Oh, hi Stan.

Stan

[a few seconds later] Hey Dad, how come you never told me about Joseph Smith?

Randy

Who?

Shelly

Shut up, turd! We're watching Friends!

Stan

The guy who spoke to God and Jesus.

Sharon

Well, Stan, God and Jesus don't actually speak to people.

Stan

That's not what the Harrisons said.

Randy

Who are the Harrisons?

Stan

The new people that moved in down the street. Mr. Harrison said that Joseph Smith spoke to God and Jesus and they told him none of the religions were right.

Randy

Oh, did he now?! What are they, religious kooks?!

Stan

They're not kooks, they're cool. I mean, how come we never have a night where we don't watch any TV and we just... do stuff together and eat and drink?

Randy

We have that, Stan. It's called Friday Night Kegger.

Stan

But that's just you and your friends.

Shelly

I said shut up, turd!

Stan

Mr. Harrison said that I should be following Heavenly Father's plan, and I don't even know what that is.

Randy

[rises and moves towards the front door] All right, that does it!

Sharon

Where are you going?

Randy

I'm gonna go have a talk with this "Mr. Harrison." [grabs his coat from the coat rack and puts it on] If he thinks he can fill my son's head with wacko religious crap, he's wrong! [drinks the last of his beer]

Sharon

Randy, don't cause trouble.

Randy

Let me handle this, Sharon. You gotta put these cult people in their place or else they never stop! I'm gonna go kick this Mr. Garrison's ass! [exits and slams the door shut, but quickly returns] This, Mr. Harrison is, is a white guy, right?

Stan

Yeah.

Randy

[confidence restored] Yeah, I'm gonna go kick his ass! [slams the door]

+++++


The neighborhood, night. Randy walks down the street.

Randy

God-damned religious kooks! Tell my son what to believe, will you?! We'll see how you like my fist in your ass! [approaches the front door of the house and pounds on the door. Gary's father answers it]

Mr. Harrison

Hello!

Randy

Yeah, are you Mr. Harrison?

Mr. Harrison

I sure am. [offers his right hand] The, the name's Gary.

Randy

Well, look, my kid was just over at your house and he a-

Gary Sr.

Oh, you're Stan's dad! It's so nice to finally meet you! Karen! Mr. Marsh is here!

Randy

Uh, look, I just want to tell you that

Karen

[arrives with a tray of squares] Oh, Mr. Marsh! What a treat! It's so nice to meet you!

Randy

Well, thanks. Uh...

Gary Sr.

Karen just finished baking the most amazing Rice Crispy squares.

Karen

With chocolate frosting

Gary Sr.

Come on out of the cold. You've gotta try one. Or six. [chuckles]

+++++


The coffee table in the living room.

Gary Sr.

I cannot tell you how wonderful it is to have you over.

Karen

[serving lemonade] I hear you're a geologist. That is so amazing.

Randy

Look, uh, I actually came over because I'm a little concerned about some of the things you told my son.

Gary Sr., Karen

Uh huh?

Randy

You know. About... God, and stuff.

Gary Sr.

Oooh... Oh boy... you think we were trying to convert him.

Randy

Well, I...

Gary Sr.

Oh, Mr. Marsh, I am sooo sorry.

Karen

We just moved here from Utah and we're so used to everyone being Mormon that we... Oh, we forget not everyone wants to hear about it. Oh boy, you must be furious!

Randy

Well, no, no, I just...

Gary Sr.

You just heard your son talking about religious ideals that aren't your own and you said "Who the heck do these people think they are?!" I I'm really, truly sorry, Mr. Marsh. It won't happen again.

Randy

Y-you can call me... Randy.

Karen

Randy, the last thing we want is for people to think we're pushing our religion. We know there are a lot of beliefs out there and ours just works for us.

Gary Sr.

To each his own, right?

Randy

Yeah. Yeah! You know, to be honest, I've never known any Mormons. I, don't even know what you people believe. Who was this Joseph Smith guy? Why did he believe that Native Americans are actually white people from Jerusalem?

Gary Sr.

Well, because they found ancient books they had written on gold plates, right where the angel Moroni said they would be.

+++++


The Early 1800s, day, a small town. People mill around.

Smith

I found them! I found them! [people turn and look, and he stops] You're not gonna believe it, everybody! I found them!

Butler

Found what?

Smith

Another New Testament of Jesus Christ!

People

What? What did he say? Are you crazy?

Smith

Last night, a Native America angel told me where I could find another testament of Jesus Christ, so I went out to the woods. I dug around all morning where the angel had told me to look. [a shot of Smith digging yet another hole].

Smith

Maybe there isn't anything out here. [strikes something hard] Wait a tick! [throws the shovel off to the side] What's this? [starts digging and find a tiny coffin, then removes the lid] Wow...

Smith

[back to the story] Inside the stone box, I found the magical seer stones. Under that, I found four gold plates written in strange writing [he lifts up two of them].

Smith

This must be the Gospel that Jesus told the Nephites!

Smith

Well, they were the most amazing things I'd ever gazed upon.

Man

[middle-aged] Well, so where are they?

Smith

Where are what?

Woman

The gold plates and the seer stones. Where are they?

Smith

Oh, well, I... was not allowed to take them. You see, after I found the plates, the angel Moroni appeared to me again and said that I am not allowed to show the plates, or the seer stones, to anybody. Because first I must translate what's written on the plates into English, so you can all read it!

Singers

Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb.

People

Wow, amazing!

Singers


He found the stones and golden plates
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
Even though nobody else ever saw them
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb



+++++


The Marsh house. Sharon and Shelly are at their spots, Stan sits on the couch, all three watch TV. Randy returns with a Book of Mormon in hand.

Sharon

So, how'd it go, Clubber Lange? You kicked Mr. Harrison's ass?

Randy

Not exactly. We're uh, having their family over for dinner tomorrow night.

Stan

See? That's what happened to me!

Randy

Sharon, did you know this guy Joseph Smith found a new testament to the Bible buried here in America?

Sharon

What are you talking about?

Randy

Well it's just that... the Harrisons are really nice people and... you should see how loving and together their family is. I, I think there's something to that religion.

Stan

That's what they made me think, too!

Randy

All right, that does it. From now on, our family is Mormon!

+++++


The neighborhood, day. In front of Kyle's house Kyle, Kenny and Cartman are tossing a football around. Stan arrives. Cartman catches the football and approaches Stan.

Cartman

Hey Stan, how was your date last night with the new kid?

Stan

Shut up, dude. They're a nice family and... Gary is actually really smart and talented.

Cartman

[cooing] Aww, you guys. I think Stan's in love.

Kyle

Yeah. Did you make out with him, too?

Stan

What's the big deal? Can't I have other friends? You guys should give Gary a chance.

Gary

[arrives] Hey Stan.

Cartman

Ohhh, here's Stan's little girlfriend now.

Gary

Hey guys. Stan, I remember you said last night that you'd lost your wallet, so I made you a new one. [hands Stan a brown leather wallet] I carved a picture of John Elway into the leather on the front.

Stan

Wow, you made this?

Cartman

[playing it up] Awww, look at them. Aren't they so cute together?

Gary

Hey! My family's on their way over to the fire station to donate blood. You wanna come along? [Cartman gags.]

Stan

Uh, I don't think so, Gary. I have to uh... [a car horn is heard]

Gary

Oh here comes my family now!

The Harrisons

Hey you guys! [they get out of the car]

Karen

Look, we painted our faces! [they laugh]

Mark

I'm a lion. [scratches the air like a lion might]

Jenny

I'm an alien. [green face paint]

Gary Sr.

Hey, just what the heck am I supposed to be? [they laugh]

Cartman

Oh my God...

Dave

[a piglet] You gonna come with us to the fire station, Stan?

Stan

[fumbling about] Uh, no. I've got a lot to do.

Gary Sr.

Well... Gary, you wanna just hang out with your friend Stan?

Gary

Oh. Well, I'd like to, but... Oh man, I would miss you guys so much!

Mark

We'd miss you too, Gary. Heh.

Karen

Aw, we'll all see each other tonight when we go to Stan's house for dinner. Stay and play with your friend, Gary.

Gary Sr.

Yeah. Have a good time, boys. [the family laughs and gets inside the car]

Mark

Let's go. [the doors close and they drive off] Our faces are painted. [more laughter]

Kyle

Wow!

Gary

So what do you guys wanna do?

Cartman

[backs away a bit with Kyle and Kenny] Uh, that's cool. We're gonna leave you two lovebirds alone. The three of us have to go put in some volunteer work at the homeless shelter. [looks at the other two. All three move off to their left and leave]

Gary

Oh cool! I'm gonna do that tomorrow.

Cartman

Eeheehee, Jesus Christ. [an awkward moment between Gary and Stan follows]

Gary

So hey, I heard your dad came over last night and he and my dad talked about Joseph Smith. That's great!

Stan

[turns right and walks. Gary walks alongside] Yeah. I had a question about that Joseph Smith guy.

Gary

Sure.

Stan

What happened after he found the golden plates buried in the ground?

Gary

Well, he kept them hidden from everyone like he was told. And then he translated what was written on the plates into the Book of Mormon.

Stan

Yeah, but... how?

+++++


Back to the 1800s, night. Joseph Smith and another man walk up into the attic of a large building.

Singers

Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb

Man

What's this all about, Mr. Smith?

Smith

Mr. Harris, can you keep a secret?

Harris

Well, sure I can.

Smith

I have, in my possession, an ancient book written on gold plates that tells of Jesus Christ's second coming. Here, in America.

Harris

In America? [scratches his head] Really? That sounds kind of...

Singers

Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb

Smith

It's true. And I'm going to translate the plates and publish it into a book for the whole world to read. Now, ahah-I know you have a lot of money, Mr. Harris, and I'm just gonna need a little bit to pay for the publishing costs.

Harris

Mmm, I don't know. Uh, how do you expect to translate it?

Smith

With these. [presents the seer stones] 

Harris

Rocks?

Smith

They're not rocks. They're seer stones, given to me by an angel. With them, God allowed me to translate the plates into English. Watch. You take this quill and paper and write down what I say. Sit here. [on the floor, by some sheets of paper and a quill pen in an ink well] I have the golden plates here in this hat. I need to have them somewhere dark so I can read the spiritual light.

Harris

Really?

Smith

Now, when I put the seer stones into the hat, the ancient letter light up and change into English, which I can then read to you.

Harris

Wow! [Smith looks down and lowers his head so the face is buried in the hat]

Smith

Ooo, I'm seeing the light. Oh, okay. Write this down. "And... so... it... was... that... Christ... appeared before... the... Nephites."

Singers


And that's how the Book of Mormon was written
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
Dumb dadumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
Dumb dadumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
Dahumb dahumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
Dumb dumb dumb dumb duuumb, duuumb.



+++++


The Marsh house, night. At the dining table they're playing the same board game the Harrisons were playing a few nights before: "LIVING".

Randy

One two three four. "Pay one thousand dollars property tax." [pays the property tax] Isn't this great, you guys? Our first Family Home Evening.

Shelly

I wanna watch TV.

Randy

We're not watching TV! We're Mormons now and we're having Family Home Evening!

Stan

Dad, did you know that that Joseph Smith guy read the Book of Mormon out of a hat?

Randy

And? [to Sharon] Your turn, Sharon.

Stan

It's just that... the Book of Mormon says a lot of strange stuff, like that Adam and Eve lived in Jackson County, Missouri.

Randy

Yes.

Stan

But school taught me that the first man and woman lived in Africa.

Randy

Well you can't believe everything school tells you, Stan. Your turn, Shelly. [the doorbell rings] Oooo, that must be the Harrisons! [rises and goes to the front door. He opens and the Harrisons walk in with enthusiasm, chatting away]

Gary

Hey everybody.

Mark

[walks around] Wow, what a great house!

Karen

[walks up to Sharon] You must be Mrs. Marsh; it's so nice to meet you!

Jenny

[walks up to Shelly] And you must be Stan's sister. Oh, I think your brother's the greatest.

Shelly

My brother is a stupid turd.

Gary

[walks up to Stan] Hey Stan.

Stan

[with reservations] Hey Gary.

Randy

Well, come on in and sit down, everybody. [they all settle in on the couches in the living room. Shelly avoids looking at the Harrisons] You're here just in time. My son was having a little problem with our new religion.

Stan

Dad!

Gary Sr.

Ohohoho, really? Well, that's just because he hasn't heard the best part about the Joseph Smith story! The one that proves he was for real!

The Harrisons

Yeah! Woohoo!

Randy

Ooo, what's that?

Gary Sr.

Well, you remember Martin Harris, the rich man who wrote down what Joseph Smith read out of the hat?

Stan

Yeah.

Gary Sr.

See, after he was done, he took some of the pages of what would become the Book of Mormon home.

+++++


Back to the 1800s, night, the large building.

Singers


Martin went home to his wife
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
And showed her pages from the Book of Mormon
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb



Harris

A-and so Joseph Smith put his head into a hat, a-and read to me what the golden plates said. I wrote it all down and we're gonna publish it into a book.

Mrs. Harris

Martin, how do you know he isn't just making stuff up and pretending he's translating off golden plates?

Singers


Lucy Harris smart smart smart
Smart smart smart smart smart



Harris

Why would he make it up?

Singers

Martin Harris dumb dadumb-

Lucy

All right, here. I'm gonna hide these pages. [puts them in a drawer at the bottom end of an armoir] If Joseph Smith really is translating off of golden plates, then he'll be able to do it again. But if Joseph Smith is making it all up, then the new translations will be different from these.

Harris

Okay, fine. I bet he'll have no problem. [puts on his coat and heads out]

Singers


Lucy Harris smart smart smart
Martin Harris dumb.
So Martin went on back to Smith
Said the pages had gone away
Smith got mad and told Martin
He needed to go pray
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb



Harris

[upon Smith's return] Look, ah I'm sorry about losin' the pages we worked on, Joe, but I'm ready to write it all down again if you translate from the plates.

Smith

I would love to, Martin, except, I just had a vision. And the Lord said he's very angry with me for letting you take those pages.

Harris

[gasps] He is??

Singers

Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb

Smith

Yes. He is so mad that he will never let me translate from the plate of Lehi again. He's... we must now translate from the plate of Nephi. So it will be the same basic story, but written a little differently.

Harris

Wow! If God got angry with you, then you must be tellin' the truth.

Singers

Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb.

Harris

All right, Martin. Let's get to work! [Smith reads from the hat again and dictates to Harris, who writes it all down]

+++++


Back to the present, the Marsh house.

Gary Sr.

And that's how it happened.

Kids

Yeah! All right! [the Marshes sit there without a word to say]

Stan

...Wait. Mormons actually know this story and they still believe Joseph Smith was a prophet?

Gary Sr.

Well sure. The story proves it, doesn't it?

Stan

No, it proves he DID make it all up. Are you blind?

Mark

Well, Stan, it's all a matter of faith.

Stan

No, it's a matter of logic! If you're gonna say things that have been proven wrong, like that the first man and woman lived in Missouri, and that Native Americans came from Jerusalem, then you'd better have something to back it up. All you've got are a bunch of stories about some asswipe who read plates nobody ever saw out of a hat, and then couldn't do it again when the translations were hidden!

Randy

Hey, Stan, don't denounce our religion.

Stan

[crosses his arms] I don't wanna be Mormon, Dad!

Shelly

Me neither.

Gary

Hey, that's only cool, guys. You can believe whatever you want!

Gary Sr.

Yeah, it's great you have your own beliefs.

Gary

Yeah! Hooray for the Marshes!

Stan

Oh, stop it! [stands up] That's another thing! Why do you have to be so freakin' nice all the time?! It isn't normal! You just weasel people into your way of thinking by acting like the happiest family in the world and being so nice to everyone that you just blindside dumb people like my Dad!

Randy

Yeah! [moments later they are standing outside, and the door is slammed on their faces. They turn around, and Gary Sr. sighs]

Gary Sr.

Well kids... Who's up for a water balloon fight?!

Kids

Yeah! All right! [they leave the Marsh house in high spirits, except Gary, who looks insulted]

+++++


The bus stop, next day. Kyle, Cartman and Kenny wait for the bus, Stan walks up somewhat somberly.

Kyle

Oh, hey Stan. Where's your best buddy, Gary?

Stan

I'm not hanging around that kid anymore.

Cartman

[needling] Oh no! You guys broke up?

Stan

You guys were right, okay? The new kid's a douche. Now I just gotta find a way to keep him away from me.

Gary

[shows up] Hey Stan.

Stan

Oh brother.

Cartman

Uh oh, the jilted lover returns.

Gary

Listen, I just wanted to let you know you don't have to worry about me tryin' to be your friend anymore.

Stan

I don't?

Look, maybe us Mormons do believe in crazy stories that make absolutely no sense, and maybe Joseph Smith did make it all up, but I have a great life. and a great family, and I have the Book of Mormon to thank for that. The truth is, I don't care if Joseph Smith made it all up, because what the church teaches now is loving your family, being nice and helping people. And even though people in this town might think that's stupid, I still choose to believe in it. All I ever did was try to be your friend, Stan, but you're so high and mighty you couldn't look past my religion and just be my friend back. You've got a lot of growing up to do, buddy. Suck my balls. [turns around and walks off. All four boys just look at him in wonder.]
