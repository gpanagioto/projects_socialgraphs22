'''The Rawhide Kid''' (real name: '''Johnny Bart''', originally given as '''Johnny Clay''') is a [[fiction]]al [[American frontier|Old West]] [[cowboy]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. A heroic gunfighter of the 19th-century American West who was unjustly wanted as an outlaw, he is one of Marvel's most prolific [[Western (genre)|Western]] characters.  He and other Marvel western heroes have on rare occasions guest-starred through [[time travel]] in such contemporary titles as ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' and ''[[West Coast Avengers]]''. In two  mature-audience [[miniseries]], in 2003 and 2010, he is depicted as [[homosexual|gay]].

==Publication history==
===Atlas Comics===
The Rawhide Kid debuted in a 16-issue series (March 1955-Sept. 1957) from Marvel's 1950s predecessor, [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Markstein |first1=Don |website=Don Markstein's Toonopedia |access-date=2 April 2020  |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/rawhide.htm |title=The Rawhide Kid}}</ref> Most of the covers from the series were produced by highly acclaimed artists, generally either [[Joe Maneely]] or [[John Severin]], but also [[Russ Heath]] and [[Fred Kida]]. Interior art for the first five issues was by [[Bob Brown (comics)|Bob Brown]], with [[Dick Ayers]] at the reins thereafter.<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/1132/ ''Rawhide Kid'' (Marvel, Atlas <nowiki>[</nowiki>Cornell Publishing Corp.<nowiki>]</nowiki> imprint, 1955 Series)] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]</ref><ref name=uhmcc1955>[http://www.maelmill-insi.de/UHBMCC/datafr.htm ''Rawhide Kid'' (I) (1955-1979)] at The Unofficial Handbook of Marvel Comics Creators</ref>

===Marvel Comics===
After a hiatus, the Rawhide Kid was revamped for what was now [[Marvel Comics]] by writer [[Stan Lee]], [[penciler]] [[Jack Kirby]] and [[inker]] Ayers. Continuing the Atlas numbering with issue #17 (Aug. 1960),<ref name=uhmcc1955 /><ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/1458/ ''Rawhide Kid, The'' (Marvel, 1960 Series)] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]. "The" as per [[copyright]]ed title in postal [[Indicia (philately)|indicia]], no "The" on cover-logo [[trademark]].</ref> the title now featured a diminutive yet confident, soft-spoken fast gun constantly underestimated by bullying toughs, varmints, owlhoots, polecats, crooked saloon owners and other archetypes squeezed through the prism of Lee and Kirby's anarchic imagination.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=78}}</ref> As in the outsized, exuberantly exaggerated action of the later-to-come [[World War II]] series ''[[Nick Fury|Sgt. Fury and His Howling Commandos]]'', ''The Rawhide Kid'' was now a freewheeling romp of energetic, almost slapstick action across cattle ranches, horse troughs, corrals, canyons and swinging chandeliers. Stringently moral, the Kid nevertheless showed a gleeful pride in his shooting and his acrobatic fight skills — never picking arguments, but constantly forced to surprise lummoxes far bigger than he was.

Through [[retcon]], bits of and pieces of the Atlas and Silver Age characters' history meshed, so that the unnamed infant son of settlers the Clay family, orphaned by a [[Cheyenne]] raid, was raised by [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Ranger]] Ben Bart on a ranch near Rawhide, Texas. Older brother Frank Clay, captured by Native Americans, eventually escaped and became a [[Gambling|gambler]], while eldest brother Joe Clay became sheriff of the town of Willow Flats; neither were in the regular cast, and each died in a guest appearance.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} Shortly after Johnny's 18th birthday, Ben Bart was murdered; Johnny, an almost preternaturally fast and accurate gunman, wounded the killers and left them to be taken into custody. A later misunderstanding between the Kid and a sheriff over a cattle rustler that the Kid wounded in self-defense led to the hero's life as a fugitive.

Kirby continued as [[penciler]] through #32 (Feb. 1963), while helping to launch the [[Fantastic Four]], the [[Hulk]] and other iconic characters of the "Marvel revolution". He drew covers through issue #47. Issues #33-35 were drawn by [[EC Comics]] veteran [[Jack Davis (cartoonist)|Jack Davis]] — some of the last color comics he would draw before gaining fame at the black-and-white [[Satire|satirical]] comics magazine ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]''. After several issues by Ayers, followed by a single issue by long-time ''[[Kid Colt]]'' artist [[Jack Keller (comics)|Jack Keller]], [[Larry Lieber]], Lee's writer brother, began his nine-year run as the series' writer-artist, which lasted over 75 issues from 1964–1973. Lieber said in 1999,
{{quote|I don't remember why I wanted to do it, particularly. I think I wanted a little more freedom. I didn't do enough of the superheroes to know whether I'd like them. What I didn't prefer was the style that was developing. It didn't appeal to me. ... Maybe there was just too much humor in it, or too much something. ... I remember, at the time, I wanted to make everything serious. I didn't want to give a light tone to it. When I did ''Rawhide Kid'', I wanted people to cry as if they were watching ''[[High Noon]]'' or something. ... I'm a little unclear about leaving the superheroes and going to ''Rawhide Kid''. I know that at the time I wanted — what's the expression? — a little space for myself or something, and I wanted to do a little drawing again.<ref>[http://www.twomorrows.com/alterego/articles/02lieber.html "A Conversation with Artist-Writer Larry Lieber"], conducted by former Marvel editor-in-chief [[Roy Thomas]], ''[[Alter Ego (magazine)|Alter Ego]]'' vol. 3, #2 (Fall 1999)</ref>}}

Rawhide Kid's full name was revealed in issue # 60 in the Letter's Column as John Barton Clay. By 1973, as superheroes became increasingly ascendant, ''The Rawhide Kid'' became primarily a reprint title, though often bearing new covers by such prominent artists as [[Gene Colan]], [[Gil Kane]] and [[Paul Gulacy]]. It ended publication with issue #151 (May 1979). This initial volume of the series included a single [[annual publication]], cover-titled ''Rawhide Kid King-Size Special'' (Sept. 1971).<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/1994/ ''Rawhide Kid Special'' (Marvel, 1971 Series)] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> As well, reprints, including many Jack Kirby-drawn stories, appeared in the 1968-1976 title ''[[The Mighty Marvel Western]]''.

The Rawhide Kid later appeared as a middle-aged character in a four-issue [[miniseries]], ''The Rawhide Kid'' (vol. 2)(Aug.-Nov. 1985), by writer [[Bill Mantlo]] and [[penciler]] [[Herb Trimpe]].<ref>[http://www.maelmill-insi.de/UHBMCC/rawhide2.htm#S1084 ''Rawhide Kid'' (II) (1985)] at The Unofficial Handbook of Marvel Comics Creators</ref><ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/3040/ ''Rawhide Kid'' (Marvel, 1985 Series)] at the Grand Comics Database. "The" as per cover-logo [[trademark]]; no "The" in [[copyright]]ed title in postal indicia.</ref>

====2000s treatments====
The Rawhide Kid reappeared in the four-issue [[miniseries]] ''[[Blaze of Glory (comics)|Blaze of Glory]]'' (Feb.-March 2000; published biweekly), by writer [[John Ostrander]] and [[artist]] [[Leonardo Manco]],<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/6294/ ''Blaze of Glory''] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> and a 2002 four-issue sequel, ''[[Apache Skies]]'', by the same creative team.<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/10154/ ''Apache Skies'' ] at the Grand Comics Database</ref>

In contrast to the character's previously depicted appearance — a small-statured, clean-cut redhead — these latter two series depicted him with shoulder-length dark hair, and wearing a slightly less stylized, more historically appropriate outfit than his classic one.
