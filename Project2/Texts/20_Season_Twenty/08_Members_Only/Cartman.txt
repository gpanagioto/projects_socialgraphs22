Hello. I understand that you're trying to get to Mars. This is my girlfriend, Heidi. She's really smart and really funny. We've given up social media and we'd like to be somewhere as far from the internet as possible. Is it true Mars would have really shitty Wi-Fi? Well, we'd like to go. We can't tolerate this world anymore and we'd like to talk to whoever we can about getting to Mars as soon as possible please. What others? What the fuck, dude?! Ah god dammit, is that Cher?! Jesus, I didn't think getting to Mars would take this long. I know, but it'll be worth it, babe. We'll be left alone to make our new world better.  What the hell are you doing here? Oh no no no! You're a male chauvinist sexist pig, Butters. You don't get to go to Mars. Butter, Butters! You expect people to believe that you went from being the biggest asshole in the school to a softhearted feminist like me? Fat chance. Yeah? You just forgot one thing, that women are funny too. That didn't occur to you, did it, Butters? Yeah, I mean, when women make vagina jokes I think it's the funniest thing ever!  Oh, I see what you're doing. Oh nothin', babe. I'm just... Do you think you could tell me some jokes? Because you're  fucking hilarious.  Oh, finally. Oh great, a stupid tour guide. Can we just talk to someone important please? We want to go to Mars.  They already have Pizza Pockets. Excuse me, Mr. Musk, this is all super interesting and shit, but can we see the Mars rocket now? Whoawhoawhoawhoa, what about going to Mars? No, no nonono, we have to go now!
