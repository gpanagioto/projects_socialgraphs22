Okay, next please. How can I help you, young man? Well that's fantastic, a really smart decision, young man. We can put that check in a Money Market Mutual Fund, then we'll reinvest the earnings into foreign currency accounts with compounding interest aaand it's gone.  It's gone. It's all gone. The money in your account - it didn't do too well, it's gone. Not anymore you don't. POOF. I'm sorry sir, but this line is for bank members only. Do you have any money invested in this bank? Then please stand aside for people who actually have money with us. Next please.  Hello Mrs. Farnickle, how are you today? Making a deposit are we? Great, we can just put that into your retirement account and make it go to work for you aaaaand it's gone. Sorry, yeah, that's gone. Please step aside for people who actually have money with the bank. Next please. Oh, Mr. Marsh, don't worry. We can just transfer money from your account into a portfolio with your son's-- aaand it's gone! This line is for people who have money with the bank only. Please step aside!
