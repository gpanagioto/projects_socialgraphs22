Hello? Oh, hey, dude. Oh, we're just makin' a cradle out of an egg carton for our egg. We figure that way it'll be easier to keep safe so we can get an A. I don't think it's gonna be that hard to keep it from breaking. This whole assignment is stupid. Why? Who? Okay, there. Now we can carry this egg around in this case without it getting cracked. Look, Stan, you want me to just take care of this egg? It's just that... I really need this A, Stan. And Bebe did say you almost broke your last egg. At who?  Huh? Wendy, it isn't your egg anymore! Well, you might have made it, but we're the ones who are taking care of it now. You have your own egg to look out for!  Wendy, I just wanna get an A, okay? Let's not make this any more confusing than it already is. <>[Stan peeks out from the kitchen and sees Kyle's arm around Wendy] Wendy, nothing's gonna happen to the egg. You can have it when the week is over and I have my grade.  Freakin' weirdos, man. What the hell is wrong with everybody? Dude, it's totally fine. Dude, did you hear what's happening? Garrison is taking us all on a field trip today. He wants to do the final egg check in front of the Governor's office! She's really taking this grade seriously, Stan. I'm gonna come over so that we can take our egg to school together, all right? Okay, Stan, you've been an asshole to me all week! What is up?! Impress Wendy?? What the hell are you talking about?! Stan? Stan? Stan, I think we should talk. Stan, I don't like Wendy.  All I cared about was getting an A in this stupid project! I thought you didn't care about Wendy anymore. Stan, there was never anything between Wendy and I.  I wouldn't go out with my best friend's ex-girlfriend. Yyeah well, I-I'm sorry I didn't trust you either.  and kept the original safe with me. Yeah dude. I'm sorry. Yeah. And I can still get my A! Stan...  Do you really think my hat is stupid?  Mr. Garrison, it's Kyle! Our egg is okay! We'll be there in a couple of minutes! Don't fail us! We'll be right there!  Keep running!  Hang on! Wait!   Gays can get married? What??  What did we do?
