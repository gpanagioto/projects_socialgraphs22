Welcome, everyone. My name is Jeff. We're thrilled you've come to help out and adopt. The parents of the children inside have all been deported, but the kids are legal citizens, since they were born in the United States.  Mr. and Mrs. White? We've all heard about your tragic loss. I'd love to help out however I can. Is there something specific you're looking for? Well, we've got all kinds here, depending on your preferences.  Here's a little Panamanian. They're very clean. This is a Colombian shorthair. Oh, and this is a good one. This is a Baja shepherd. Bien, gracias. ¿Y tú?  Yes, they're pretty silly-looking. Great with kids though. Oh, why, this is a purebred Mexican. He's had all his shots; parents were deported two weeks ago. Here, we can let him run around a little bit.  Bien, gracias. ¿Y tú?  We're so glad you came back, Mr. and Mrs. White. We have even more kids now whose parents have been deported. Oh, here's a good one. Four years old, parents just deported yesterday. He's a Panamanian podengo pequeño. We could see how he gets along with the kids.
