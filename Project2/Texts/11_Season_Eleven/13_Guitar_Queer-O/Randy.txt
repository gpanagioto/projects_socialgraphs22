 Sharon, what are the boys doing? They can play guitar now? Ohhh. Hey yeah...  So you boys like this music, huh?  I can actually play a lot of these songs on a real guitar. You want me to teach you boys how? But... But this is real.  No way! Ahhh, Ahhhhhhh... Hang on, I almost caught the dragon.  I can get him! Wait! Where's he going now? NOO! NOOO, I SAID! I AM YOUR FATHER! PUT IT BACK ON!
