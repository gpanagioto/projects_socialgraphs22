I have a thing called diabetes. It's a condition that affects the way my body processes sugar. It just means that I have to check my blood sugar once in a while, and sometimes I have to...  ...part of who I am. Oh, and I also have a pony. Oh thanks. That's really nice of you. Wow, that'd be great. A couple of the other guys offered too. That's funny. Another one of the guys said that. He was the tall kid that kinda dresses like you.  ...yeah, and so my dad actually still lives in Scottsdale. Oh, okay.  I'll see you around, huh? Yeah. Oh.  Um, I haven't really thought about it. Do you watch The Mandalorian on Disney+? Right? It's the best Star Wars thing since Empire. Makes all the new movies look like dog shit. Hey, are you gonna watch the new episode on Friday? We could watch it together if you want. Okay. I'll be over right when it starts streaming. Hey!  I have to watch right when it starts streaming. I hate spoilers. This'll be a great place to watch it.  Uh oh. Hey, do you have some juice or something? My blood sugar is a little low. Huh? Great!  Mm, okay, it's time. Put it on. Ohmygod ohmygod ohmygod ohmygod! Yesyesyesyes!  Hey, uh, what's going on? Can you change it back? It's gonna be okay. That Jimmy kid invited me to watch at his house. Come on!  Hay! Hope it's still okay to come over? Oh no, your streaming services are messing up too? No. We were just at Scott's house and it was the same thing. This is terrible! Mom, I can't watch Mandalorian anywhere.  oh no, it's happening here too? What are you talking about, Scott? I'm not your girlfriend. I'm not anyone's girlfriend! I just fuckiing moved here, you guys. Can I have some time to unpack the shit in my room? Scott, I'm more than just my diabetes. Need a candy bar?  It stinks having diabetes sometimes, huh? Still sucks. Kids don't know how much extra you have to do every day just to be okay. I'm glad there's a kid at my new school who I can talk about diabetes with. You know what? I don't think you're any weirder and grosser than any of the other boys in this town. That's okay. I had an interesting night. I think I kind of like the Scott Malkinson Show.
