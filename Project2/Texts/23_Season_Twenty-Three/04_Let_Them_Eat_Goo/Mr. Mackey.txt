 Whoawhoawhoawhoa, what's goin' on, kids? Okay, kids, we don't want another incident here, okay? Eric, it's okay. We aren't going to change the school menu, okay? Everything's fine. Girls, I'm sorry, but the health of our students has to come first.  Wuhuhuhu... hello, Eric. Whoa, uh, thank God it worked. Walk, don't run, m'kay?  N-Now, Eric, stay calm, mm-kay! We're sorry. We were just trying to find a compromise! Now just be calm.
