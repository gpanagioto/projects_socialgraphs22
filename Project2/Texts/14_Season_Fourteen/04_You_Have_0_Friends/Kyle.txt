How the hell do you have more friends than me? How many friends do you have, Kenny? What? How the hell do I only have thirty-seven friends? Stan, you don't get how cool Facebook has become. You can message your friends, play Yahtzee with your friends, even start your own virtual farm and have your friends visit it. Yeah dude, we made you your own Facebook page.  Yeah, but now you can be friends with all of us! Aww gee, that's... so sad. Everyone should have one Facebook friend. There's really people out there without a Facebook friend in the world? That's so wrong. I think I'll add some more... pigs.  Can I come in? I... don't... have... any... friends... I mean, I do, but, well, ever since I became friends with that Kip Drordy kid, a bunch of my other friends have started ignoring me. It would be fine except for my farm is starting to shrink. I know that I should just dump Kip as a friend, but that's such a terrible thing to do and, I'm sorry I'm just so confused I... I really need a friend right now. 'K, so then get on Facebook and fertilize my crops? Pleahehese! My farm hasn't expanded in three days!  You don't get sucked into it! You don't get sucked in at all! Plehehehehehease! 'Kay, so now just click on the little soil button...  Okay, now I can read the sign you put up... Yeah. We're very good friends. We're very good friends, Stan! I don't know what to do. I just can't seem to get my friend numbers to go up. I'm desperate. That's why I came to you. I can't do that, I'd just feel too bad. I've been trying! But I just don't know how to make totally new friends on the Internet. No. What's chatroulette? Hey, uh that's, that's kinda cool.  That's just a guy's penis too!  Dude, I don't wanna see a bunch of guys' penises! Dude, screw this! I don't wanna see anymore! That's it Cartman, I'm outta here!  Hey, so... do you wanna be Facebook friends? Heck yeah I'll visit your farm! You should check mine out too! Okay, I fed the pigs. Now I definitely should water some fields... Oh wow, cool. That Jewish kid put up a sign on my farm. "Hey Kyle, really like your farm." Oh awesome!   ...What?  Dude, w-what are you doing? Profile status? Well, Stan I have to harvest my crops before it's too late. Dude! Dude okay! S-Stop! I'm sorry!  Says that you are currently... hosting an online chat party for all your friends. Caf√© World. An online chat party for all his friends... Dude, I should get over there! Wow, there's a lot of profiles here. Kyle Broflovski's amazed Stan has so many Facebook friends. Hey, Kyle Broflovski's amazed Isiah is also a Facebook friend of Stan's. What? Why? Oh n-no, I'm not really friends with him. Unh, that does it! I'm sorry, Kip, but I really can't be your friend anymore. It was a great ride, but I must say goodbye. This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do, but ending a friendship... is never easy.
