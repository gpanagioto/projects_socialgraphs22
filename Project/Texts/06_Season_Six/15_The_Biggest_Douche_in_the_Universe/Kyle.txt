Yeah, and, we don't know whether or not we should care. Kenny's ashes were in an urn, and Cartman drank it, thinking it was chocolate milk mix. Well like we said, we didn't know whether or not we should care? We're going to New York?  Oh cool. We get to watch a movie? We have a dead friend. Yee-yeah. ''I'm'' Kyle.  She's here? Oh my God!  Grandma's watching me. Always watching me. Four white birds! There's four white birds!  This is what Grandma wants? She wants me to attend Jewleeard. So is it a coincidence that Grandma DID talk to me about going to Jewleeard someday? I'm not going back. I have to join Jewleeard and make Grandma proud!  Don't try and stop me, Stan! This is what my grandma wants! He's not a douche! He talked to my grandma! You're just jealous he's a better psychic than you.  You're right, Stan. My Grandma isn't floating around, judging me and watching what I do. She's dead. Dead and gone forever.
