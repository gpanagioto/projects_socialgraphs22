Hello there, children! How's it going? Well, they're about to get worse. All I can serve you for lunch is lumpy potatoes. Sorry, children. All my funding's been cut. I don't know, children.  Why don't you ask your dad? He's a lawyer, ain't he? Well, somebody else has got to know all about this sexual harassment whosafudge. Well, I hope you do. Otherwise, it's lumpy potatoes from here on out.
