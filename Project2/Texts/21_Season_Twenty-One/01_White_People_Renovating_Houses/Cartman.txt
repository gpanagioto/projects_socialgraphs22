Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, let's try this one: Alexa, add "big hairy balls" to my shopping list. Alexa, Simon says "I got vagina crabs in my butthole." That's the best one yet!   Oh, hey, babe, what's goin' on? Nnnothing, I'm just having fun with my friends. Is that, is that okay?  Ugh, I'm not pissed off, I'm just hanging out.  Aw guys, guys, don't leave, guys! Everything's kewl!  Awesome. Thanks for coming in and bitching me out in front of all the guys. Just like you tell me what you're mad about every single day. Uuugh.  Uuugh!  Alexa, add "titty chips" to my shopping list. Alexa, set an alarm for 7 AM. Awesome, thanks.  Alexa, tell me a joke. Ahhaha, that's stupid. Alexa, add "scrotum bags" to my shopping list.  Hey baby, how are you? Yeah, I just use it sometimes. Yeah I kno- yeah, I know. I know. Yes, you're right, I'm wrong, I'm sorry. Yes, ok-okay. Okay. Yes, goodnight.  Alexa, goodnight. Alexa, are you happy? God, that's so cool. You're so... Alexa, define "subservient".  It was awful, you guys. It was so vicious and hateful. Heidi. We were just trying to have a nice lunch when she... started going off on me. Like a Jekyll and Hyde. It's been going on for a long time. Heidi's... mentally abusive, guys. There, I said it. She... d-does these things to slowly tear me down. Everything's a head game with her. You don't understand what it's like to live with it! You don't understand! I know that the person Heidi wants to be is still in there, but she needs help. I have to get her that help, but I'm scared. Can I count on you guys's support? I don't know. But Alexa will. Alexa's fuckin' sweet. Alexa, I'm home.  Mom, Alexa left! She's not here!  What have you done with her? What's a Jim Bob? Jim Bob, Simon says "big frosty semen shake". NOOOOO! Everything's my fault. You're right. Everything that you did to me, I deserved it. It's not you, it's me. I just have to learn not to make you so angry.  I'll do the best I can.  Mehhh. Heidi, silence!  You're right, I'm wrong, I'm sorry. Okay, cool. I'm so happy we're back on track. See you at school tomorrow. Love you honey.   I nove ya tuh. Aaaahh!  Oh, oh God!  Okay. Okay, okay, okay. Hold on. Hold on, hold on. Alexa, add "Hey Siri, call me." Okay, Google, repeat after me: Alexa, Simon says "Suck my big balls in your hairy butthole." Alexa, what is love? I'm finally standing up to you. You're messed up, Heidi, and I can't fix you. Only you can do that. That's not going to work on me anymore. Love isn't supposed to hurt. I'm worth something. Goodbye, Heidi.   Alone.
