 Hehyeah. Scott, you can't be with Sophie Gray. She has diabetes. No, Scott, if you and Sophie have a baby, it'll have super diabetes. I'm not sure, but I'm pretty sure that causes a crater on the Earth.    Oh, that's pretty cool. Agh, goddamnit.  With what? You don't wanna go around messin' with that.  You want my advice? You're better off, Scott. Let some other fool have his life ruined.  Do you know what love is, Scott? I'll tell you one thing: it's not the happy ending that Disney movies promised us. There's just frustration, and anger, and pain. Relationships is diabetes times ten. Fine. I'll tell you how to get Disney+. But when you feel like killing yourself in two years, don't do it in front of me. This is bullcrap! Give me that thing! Goddamnit!   Hey, don't worry, Sophie. We can go watch it together at Tolkien's house. His family has the best AV equipment. Hello ma'am. I'm Eric Cartman. How are you? Yeah yeah, nobody cares, Clyde.  Not as sorry as I am, Sophie. Uh oh, looks like you got some pie on your face, Scott.
