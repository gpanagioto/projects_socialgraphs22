Yeah! Like Stan gives a crap if Wendy breaks up!   Why? Aw, dude, come on. I gotta do my science homework.  'Kay.  She says she's been wantin' to break up for a while, and it's nothing against you.  Stan, you can't keep doing this to yourself. You have to go live. Dude, not now!  Jeez, he's worse than I thought. No. We just have to show him that there's other girls out there. I say we take him to Raisins. What do you think, Stan. These girls are pretty cute, huh? Hey. Hey, look over there, Stan. That Raisins girl is ''really'' cute, huh?  Hey. Uh, this is Stan. Okay. Okay, come on you guys.  Look, we're just trying to show you there's other girls out there. What are you doing?  Come on, Stan. We're gonna play dodgeball. Dude, you need to snap out of this! So Wendy left you for Tolkien. What are you gonna do? Just be miserable your whole life? Aw, come on, dude! All you've done for the last four days is mope around! You might as well hang out with those Goth kids who dress in black and talk about pain all the time! Oh Jesus Christ, I had to see it to believe it! What the hell are you doing?! God-damnit dude, your mom and dad want you to come home! Oh, like ''you'' know what pain is! Go try living in a Third-World country, you little pussy! Stan, this is it. Time to stop feeling sorry for yourself and come home! Everyone cares about you and everyone wants you back! Yeah. She is.  Fine. That's it. I give up. Have fun being miserable.  Okay, it's third down. And now, somebody make a play! What happened? Aren't you still wallowing in pain? Well. Dude, it's uh it's good to have you back.
