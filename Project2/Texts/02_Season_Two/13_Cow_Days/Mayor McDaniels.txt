Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to kick off the 14th Annual South Park Cow Days! As most of you know, Cow Days is when we all get together to celebrate and thank the noble, gentle cow. And now, the chairman of Cow Days, Jimbo Kern! Now get out to the carnival and enjoy the amazing rides and the wonderful games! You found it! You found the memorial! And the cows? Are they all back, too? What?! Well, perhaps, one day, cows will learn that cults are never a good thing. Sounds like somebody declared Shenanigans! Didn't we ever release them? Oh my God! Officer Barbrady, ugh, you never had Tom and Mary in this cell. No, no. In fact, they never came to South Park. We've never heard of them.
