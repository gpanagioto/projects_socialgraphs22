No, dude. Spielberg changed "terrorist" to "hippie" to make E.T. more P.C. Why don't they leave those movies alone? We liked them the way they were! Yeah, what if they had modified the Roman Coliseum every year? It would just be another big douchey stadium now. Yeah. We'll be the "Save Films From Their Own Directors" club. "Free hat?" Calm down, Tweek. Fifteen might be enough.  Tweek! It's okay. Look, maybe these people all turned out because they be''lieve'' in saving films. Maybe they don't even care about the free hats. We believe that films are pieces of art that must be preserved from the perverse hands of their agent filmmakers... What? Yah. You?? Why? Me. Alright, fine!  You're the spokesman, Cartman! But you'd better not screw it up! We believe that films have to be taken away from people like Steven Spielberg and George Lucas because they're insane. Ah, we thought ''we'' were speaking for the children. Dude, don't you see that it's not? It'd be like, changing ''Raiders of the Lost Ark''!  No. NOO!!  Nonono! We need to do ''this'' first. We're just gonna fly to California and break into George Lucas's house. What's stressful about that?  This looks like the right room. That's it! Do with us what you will, Mr. Lucas!  But please, don't change ''Raiders of the Lost Ark''. ...But you can't melt ice with a cool song, r-tard. Well then we're gonna end up freezing his hellish heart with a cool island song. It's not too late to do what's right. Give us the print. There's still some good in you, Mr. Lucas. We know there is.  You yourself led the campaign against the colorization of films. You understand why films shouldn't be changed. When an artist creates, whatever they create belongs to society. Don't listen to him! You still have a chance to preserve your film!  What?? Yup. Come on, Tweek! Blow it up! Yeah. I I think so. ...What?  Do you think we did a good thing, Stan?  I mean, no one even seemed to notice.
