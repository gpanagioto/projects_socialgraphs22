'''Henry Peter Gyrich''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|g|aɪ|r|ɪ|k}}<!--as pronounced in the ''X-Men'': Night of the Sentinels: Part 2 (1992)-->) is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He is a liaison of the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] who is against the [[superhuman]] community.

==Publication history==
The character first appeared in ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' Vol. 1 #165 (November 1977) and was created by [[Jim Shooter]] (writer) and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] ([[penciller]]).

==Fictional character biography==
Henry Gyrich is the first person to be given the title of US Government liaison to the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] by the [[National Security Agency]] later by the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]]. With his status, Gyrich is one of only two people (the other being the [[President of the United States]]) who could affect the Avengers in many difficult ways. During his tenure, Gyrich revokes the Avengers' priority status after taking issue.<ref>''The Avengers'' #168 (February 1978)</ref> The Avengers have to accept Gyrich's "suggestions" or have their [[Quinjet]]s and other sensitive equipment confiscated.<ref>''The Avengers'' #181 (July 1979)</ref> He limits the Avengers' active membership to seven members, forces the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]] to join unwillingly to fill an affirmative action quota Gyrich sets, and installs various security measures for the team<ref>''The Avengers'' #181 (July 1979)</ref> Gyrich oversees the Avengers' activities for the next several months without incident, until he forbids the team to go on a mission to help [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]].<ref>''The Avengers'' #186 (August 1979)</ref> The next incident involves a security leak. Gyrich takes part in a [[United States Senate|Senate]] investigation involving the Avengers which claims the team are national security threats. When the investigation ends, the Senate committee gives the Avengers new guidelines to follow, and the committee designates [[Raymond Sikorski]] as his successor.<ref>''The Avengers'' #235</ref>

Writer [[Peter David]] has indicated that Shooter based Gyrich on himself. David attempted to humanize Henry by giving a backstory which touched upon Gyrich's family life. After [[Betty Ross|Betty Banner]] criticizes Gyrich for appearing callous and unfeeling when mentioning the pain of [[Thunderbolt Ross]] dying, Gyrich cuts Banner off, saying "My father died of [[Alzheimer's]], [Betty]. I took a year's leave to care for him so he wouldn't be watched over by strangers that my crummy salary couldn't even afford. I cleaned up after him, tended to him, and his last words as I cradled his dying body were, 'Who in heck are you?'";<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #456 (August 1997)</ref><ref>[http://peterdavid.malibulist.com/archives/005313.html "Q&A" entry on David's blog; April 14, 2007 (The information on this point is in the April 16, 2005, 9:31 a.m. post.)]</ref> ''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' later revealed that Gyrich's greatest fear is contracting the same disease that killed his father.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #5</ref>

Prior to his involvement with the Avengers, Gyrich was [[NSA]] Liaison to [[Canada]]'s [[Department H]]. While there, he met and had repeated issues with Canada's chief agent [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]].{{issue|date=July 2013}}

Gyrich becomes a member of the [[Registration acts (comics)|Commission of Superhuman Activities]] (CSA), the oversight body on superhuman activities in the United States; he's part of the team that forces [[Captain America]] to resign. Gyrich also takes part as a special consultant in a [[Project Wideawake|covert government]] designed to deal with the problems concerning [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]] in the [[United States]]. The project is instrumental in creating a [[Freedom Force (comics)|mutant team]] to counter the foreign mutants threat.{{issue|date=July 2013}}

===Dire Wraith===
Henry Gyrich is later involved in war efforts against the [[Dire Wraith]] extraterrestrials. This time, he works alongside the mutant [[Forge (comics)|Forge]] who works as a weapons maker for the US government and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] Gyrich takes Forge's specially designed superhuman power-neutralizing gun to capture the mutant [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] for breaking into a facility S.H.I.E.L.D. In an encounter with Rogue, [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] and government forces, Gyrich accidentally shoots Storm and his specialized weapon strips Storm's powers and abilities as a mutant (but Storm's powers return some time later). Gyrich continues attempting to use Forge's own version of [[Rom the Spaceknight|Spaceknight Rom]]'s Neutralizer, planning to use an orbital version to wipe out all superpowers on Earth. Rom and Forge stop him, however, and he can only watch while tied up as Rom banishes Wraithworld (the Dire Wraith's home world) instead of destroying all the heroes and villains. Gyrich is also involved in hunting the [[Hulk]] after [[Onslaught (Marvel Comics)|Onslaught]]'s events.{{issue|date=July 2013}}

===Hunted by others===
Henry Gyrich is targeted for assassination by the current form of the Mutant Liberation Front (MLF), led by the energy-casting [[Reignfire]]. His lack of gratitude for being rescued is part of what led the mutant [[Feral (comics)|Feral]] to defect from [[X-Force (comics)|X-Force]] to the MLF.<ref>''X-Force'' Vol. 1 #27–28 (October–November 1993)</ref> Gyrich is a key player in [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]]'s [[Operation: Zero Tolerance|program]]. He is a faithful believer in the operation until he himself becomes a target of [[Prime Sentinels]]. After being rescued by [[Spider-Man]], [[Marrow (comics)|Marrow]] and [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]], Gyrich demands the program be shut down.{{issue|date=July 2013}}

===Political exploits===
Gyrich is promoted to be [[Valerie Cooper]]'s successor as the CSA's head. While there, [[Baron Strucker]] secretly places Gyrich under the control of nanites. Gyrich uses Commission resources and remolds the vigilante [[Jack Monroe (comics)|Nomad]] into the assassin [[Scourge of the Underworld|Scourge]] and attempts to live out his "fantasy" of killing all the world's superhumans, before being stopped by the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #49. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Following that incident, he's reassigned to the [[United States Department of State|US State Department]] and is made the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]'s liaison as well as the Avengers' new liaison to the [[United Nations]] (by Captain America's suggestion). During this time, he redeems himself in the eyes of the team when he refuses to deliver information on the Avengers to the [[Red Skull]] (disguised as the Secretary of Defense Dell Rusk). He never breaks, even under severe torture, which impressed the others. Now a faithful liaison officer to the Avengers, Gyrich's job comes to an end after the United Nations' relationship with the Avengers ends.<ref>''[[Avengers Disassembled]]''</ref>

Following the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' storyline, Gyrich has become the Secretary of the Superhuman Armed Forces. His base of operations is the [[Camp Hammond (comics)|superhuman training facility]] in [[Stamford, Connecticut]]. It is under his orders that [[Gauntlet (comics)|Gauntlet]] is drafted as the facility's drill instructor, after Gauntlet saves him from an attack by [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]] in Iraq.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #1 (April 2007)</ref> Gyrich gives orders to cover up [[Michael Van Patrick|MVP]]'s death. He makes arrangements to provide a special tutor to [[Trauma (comics)|Trauma]] through [[Beast (comics)|Hank McCoy]];<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #2 (May 2007)</ref> the tutor is revealed to be depowered mutant [[Dani Moonstar]],<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #3</ref> but the two don't get along well and Gyrich fires Moonstar for training Trauma to use his powers to help people with debilitating phobias instead of using these abilities as a weapon. After KIA's debacle, Gyrich had to take part in an inquiry involving the Initiative program, and gets into a heated argument with [[Iron Man]] in which Gyrich exclaims to Iron Man, "you've got Captain America's blood on your hands!". Apparently removed from his position after throwing out that sentence, he later makes a statement claiming at a press conference he had decided to "retire" to spend time with his family. When a reporter points out that Gyrich has no living family, he declines to elaborate.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #12</ref>

Gyrich becomes the main antagonist for Kieron Gillen's and Steven Sander's new series ''S.W.O.R.D.'' where he joins [[S.W.O.R.D. (comics)|S.W.O.R.D.]] (Sentient World Observation and Response Department) under [[Norman Osborn]]'s orders and becomes the co-leader alongside [[Abigail Brand]].{{issue|date=July 2013}} In the first volume, Gyrich manages to kidnap several notable aliens including [[Noh-Varr]], [[Adam X]], [[Jazinda]], [[Karolina Dean]] and [[Hepzibah (comics)|Hepzibah]], all in his desire to send aliens home. He also arrests both Brand and Lockheed.<ref>''S.W.O.R.D.'' #2</ref> Gyrich survives an alien takeover of the installation simply by being too dosed on intruder-neutralization gas to be much of a threat. Brand, with the assistance of several super-powered beings, takes back the job and blackmails Gyrich into leaving S.W.O.R.D. alone.<ref>''S.W.O.R.D. Volume 1: No Time To Breathe'' (120 pages, July 2010, {{ISBN|0-7851-4076-X}}) (2010)</ref>

While it is unknown if he was brainwashed by HYDRA or it was by his own will, Gyrich worked along HYDRA to control [[Demolition Man (comics)|Dennis Dunphy]] and turn into the new [[Scourge of the Underworld|Scourge]] in order to kill criminals and "fix the system". After Captain America tended him a trap, he was captured by S.H.I.E.L.D.<ref>''Captain America'' #12–13</ref>

During the ''[[Civil War II]]'' storyline, Gyrich represented the United States as a member of the [[Alpha Flight]] Space Program's [[Board of governors|Board of Governors]].<ref>''Captain Marvel'' Vol. 9 #6</ref>

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
In the "[[Age of Apocalypse]]" alternate timeline storyline, Gyrich is an anti-mutant suicide bomber who threatens to destroy Heaven, [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]]'s club. He is defeated by the [[Bedlam (comics)#Other versionsBedlam Brothers]]. He was returned in the current "Age of Apocalypse" on-going, as a leader in the human resistance. He lost his legs, in "the offensive to blow the Seattle power core", confining him to a wheelchair, and is seen helping evaluate the now powerless [[Jean Grey]].<ref>''Factor X'' #1</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] iteration of Henry Gyrich visually looks like his mainstream counterpart albeit with blond hair. He works for the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], trying to establish a check and balance system for [[Nick Fury (Ultimate Marvel character)|Nick Fury]] and the [[Ultimates]] in case. When a rapidly aged clone that was led to believe into being [[Richard and Mary Parker|Dr. Richard "Ray" Parker]], the clone's backstory included continuing the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] project for Gyrich.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #100</ref><ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #103</ref> However, it turns that the real Gyrich works instead for an [[FBI]] strike team to find Otto Octavius.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #104</ref> During Peter Parker's and [[Spider-Woman (Ultimate Marvel character)|Spider-Woman]]'s battle with [[Doctor Octopus]], Fury distracts Gyrich by asking confusing questions and confronting him about the illegal [[Clone Saga|Spider-Clone]] program of [[Spider-Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Spider-Man]] which had been going on behind [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #105</ref>

===What If...?===
*In one issue of [[What If...? (comics)|''What If...?'']], Gyrich is summoned by the U.S. President to disrupt a rally led by [[Valeria Richards|Mary Richards]], the daughter of [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] and [[Invisible Woman|Susan Richards]], and a philanthropic healer and activist, because the President fears the mounting popularity for her cause. Gyrich attempts to do so by disguising himself as [[Captain America]] and hiding agitators in the crowd; he manages to approach and critically stab Mary before he gets his hand broken by the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]]. But his plan severely backfires when Mary uses healing powers to quell the outbreaking violence amongst the crowd and, after making a full recovery, subsequently instigates the dissolution of the existing government system. Following that, Gyrich receives a visit from Captain America, who is out for revenge for Gyrich's abuse of his name and ideals.<ref>''What If...?'' Vol.2 #30 (1991)</ref>
