Our school now has a very strict policy when it comes to immunizations. Everyone has to follow the protocol, or it puts everyone at risk. Well, Eric, nobody likes shots. They're just a fact of life. I'm sorry, but my hands are tied here. If Eric isn't immunized, then he cannot go to this school. What do you think's gonna be different next time you try? Like, what are you thinking? What I care most about is the safety of the students, so if you take your shots, then I'll agree.. Alright everyone, listen up.  I understand your frustration, but a government organization like a school cannot impose its will on a conscientious objector..
