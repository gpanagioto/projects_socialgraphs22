''[opens up] ''Oh. Hello there, children! Oh boy... Well come on inside, children. I'll make you some cocoa. Have a seat, children. Just try to relax and breathe.  Are you all okay? All right. Now, where did you get served? Okay okay, relax children. Relax. It's all over now. Just try to calm down and sit tight.  Mrs. Marsh? Hi, it's Chef. Yeah, I'm good. Listen: Stan and his friends just got served. Yeah. Yeah, over at the True Value. No no, he's fine. They're all fine. Yeah, it was some kids from out of town. Apparently, they were pretty good dancers. They really let 'em have it. Oh no!  No, stop Stan! You don't know what you're doin'!  No no no! Oh dammit! I knew that was gonna happen. Stan, what the hell did you dance back for? Now you've gotta compete against them in the dance competition on Saturday! Because if you get served and served them back, then it's on! Don't you know anything?? Oh Lord... All right, children, let's get to rehearsin'!  This... is the dance troupe? Oh boy.  All right, well, why don't you show me what you got? I wanna see what you kids can do! Oh Lord have mercy.  No no, scratch that. You have the heart and the soul, but you don't have the talent. All right, all right, quiet, children! Now, nobody's getting served if I can help it. We just gotta buckle down, dig deep, and pray that maybe the other team comes down with cancer.  Rules are you have to have five dancers. We have no choice, children. We have to forfeit. All right! All right! We did it!
