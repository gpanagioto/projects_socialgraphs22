'''Randy Robertson''' is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He is a [[supporting character]] in Marvel's [[Spider-Man]] series and is depicted as the son of [[Robbie Robertson (comics)|Robbie Robertson]].

==Publication history==
Randy first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #67 (December [[1968 in comics|1968]]), created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[John Romita Sr.]] He was the first [[African-American]] among [[Peter Parker|Peter Parker's]] friends,<ref>{{cite book|last1 = Manning|first1 = Matthew K.|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = Spider-Man Chronicle Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2012|page = 45|isbn = 978-0756692360|quote= Randy Robertson made his debut. The son of city editor Joe Robertson, he would go on to be the first African-American member of Peter Parker's group of friends.}}</ref> and was introduced in a storyline about student unrest at college, a move by Marvel to be more in touch with the teenagers of 1968.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wells |first1=John |title=American Comic Book Chronicles: 1965-1969 |date=2014 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1605490557 |page=268}}</ref>

Randy's father, Robbie, was a high-ranking editor at the fictional ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' whose storylines didn't draw attention to his race; his portrayal was criticized by one letter-writer who said, "It seems to me that your Negroes are merely white people drawn by the artist with their skins darkened by the colors."<ref name=Power>{{cite book |last1=Lee |first1=Peter |title=Web-Spinning Heroics: Critical Essays on the History and Meaning of Spider-Man |date=2014 |publisher=McFarland & Co |isbn=9780786491674 |pages=35–37 |chapter-url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/Web_Spinning_Heroics/tzoqen2moRwC?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=%22randy+robertson%22+spider-man&pg=PA36&printsec=frontcover |access-date=2 May 2020 |chapter=Have Great Power, Greatly Irresponsible: Intergenerational Conflict in 1960's Amazing Spider-Man}}</ref> The creation of Randy was in part a response to this criticism. Randy directly leveled the challenge at his father: "I know you've got made here in whitey's world! But what about the ''other'' brothers who played it your way... who ''got'' their sheepskins... and ''still'' can't make it on the outside?" (''Amazing Spider-Man'' #73, June 1969).<ref name=Power/>

In 1971, Randy played a similar role, acting as a voice of the people in an argument with [[Norman Osborn]] about drug abuse: "It hurts us more than anyone else — 'cause too many of us got no ''hope'' — so we're easier ''pickin's'' for the pushers. But it ain't just ''our'' problem! It's ''yours'', too!" (''Amazing Spider-Man'' #96, May 1971). This compassionate take on the hot topic of drug abuse was applauded by readers, as well as teachers and parents.<ref name=Power/>

Randy never became a first-tier supporting character; he appeared off-and-on through the 1970s, and was then dropped for several years. There have been periods where Randy has appeared regularly, including 1988–1989, 2000–2001, and 2011–2012. [[Nick Spencer|Nick Spencer's]] "Back to Basics" arc at the beginning of ''ASM'' volume 5 (Sept 2018) brought Randy back as a regular character, living with Peter Parker as his roommate.

==Fictional character biography==
Randy Robertson, son of [[Daily Bugle]] city editor [[Robbie Robertson (comics)|Joseph "Robbie" Robertson]], enrolled at [[Empire State University]] a year behind Bugle photographer Peter Parker. A boisterous hothead unlike his even-tempered father, Randy quickly became involved in student activism, albeit usually as the voice of moderation to the more radical Josh Kittiling. On his father's advice, Randy sought Peter's friendship, although Parker's double life as [[Spider-Man]] left him little time to help Randy promote social change. The day after meeting Peter, Randy joined Josh and other in protesting E.S.U.'s plans to turn an exhibition hall into a dorm for visiting alumni, rather than for needy students. The crime boss [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] interrupted their demonstration to steal the lifeline Tablet, allegedly containing the secret to longevity. When Spider-Man intervened, Randy tried to restrain Kingpin.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #67. Marvel Comics.</ref> Though he was easily knocked aside, but following Kingpin's defeat, Spider-Man did not forget Randy's act of courage. Randy soon joined Peter's circle of college friends, although he was rarely drawn into Spider-Man's activities at E.S.U. and elsewhere in New York City. His rebellious streak eventually faded, and after graduating from E.S.U. Randy pursued graduate studies in social work at Pittsburg State University, where he met and married fellow student Mandy Batavides, a Jewish woman.

Randy eventually returned to New York with Mandy, and although their hasty marriage troubled Robbie, he soon accepted Mandy as a daughter-in-law. Randy and Mandy stayed at Robbie's side after the hitman [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]] crippled him. Following his father's recovery, Randy disagreed with Robbie about pleading guilty to misprison of felony and vigorously protested his father's imprisonment. He nonetheless continued to provide his mother Martha with emotional support. and the family was soon reunited when Robbie, after escaping death at Tombstone's hands during a forced prison break, received a pardon. When Mandy received a job offer in California, the younger Robertson couple relocated to the West Coast, but various factors strained their marriage, and Randy returned to New York alone following their divorce.<ref>''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #17.

Marvel Comics.</ref> Following a direct encounter with Green Goblin, Randy sought advice from Robbie as his father had significant experience with super-villains from his Bugle position.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Volume 2 #26.

While almost meeting his death, Norah is entranced in reporting the whole thing and misses an opportunity to save Randy.
