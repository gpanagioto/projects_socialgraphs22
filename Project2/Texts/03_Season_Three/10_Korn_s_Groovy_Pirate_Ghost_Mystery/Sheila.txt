Hold on, kids.  Yes? Eehh, sure, come in.  What is it? Defiled? How? Dug her up? Why?? What?! Hoh, dear God!  Oooh.  O-o-o-o-oh! Okay, okay! I get the point! Just tell me what you're gonna do about it! O-o-ogh!   People stealing bodies to have sex with them? Pirate ghosts destroying the town? When did everything go so wrong? Well, this is all fine and good, but it doesn't explain what happened to my mother's body!
