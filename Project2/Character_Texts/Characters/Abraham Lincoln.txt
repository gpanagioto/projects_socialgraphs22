I am Abraham Lincoln. Burning down the school will not solve your problems. You think you've been cheated because you are ugly, but I am here to show you otherwise. Come! There is much to see.  Now that he knows he's good-looking, he doesn't have to make any effort to be special. Now his life will be about girls. Chatting with them on the phone and buying them shoes. He will most likely marry very young, and not realize until age 40 that he's a total douche. And so you see, Kyle, it is actually the beautiful kids that are cursed. You must be patient.  Very well. Kyle, you need to think about what I've told you. Well then you're just a fucking asshole!
