If you knew something, but, you couldn't tell anyone, what... what would you do?  I love it sooo sooo much. Because they taste so yummy.  Not if you... have some delicious farts for me. Please... Yummy yummy. Hey I am happy, Stan. I'm thrilled.  I just do, Stan. Yes. Yes. NO. This is Cartman. I have to take it.  Hello?  I don't care. That's fine.  Please, just, just leave it alone, Stan. Everything is as it has to be. No more. No more. Oh, come on, Cartman, no. No more.  Huh? Who...? Who is that? I... because the world is at peace. I must endure. I... I know. That's, that that's k-kind of what I was thinking. Yes. I endure what I must for the sake of all humanity. Yes! Yes I will! Yes, whatever you want.   Hello, Stan. There are greater things at work than what you understand. I'm actually the complete opposite. I'm not better, I'm just... doing what needs to be done to make the world a better place.  I happen to be the one person who's putting everyone else's needs before their own! All you need to know is I'm way awesomer than you think, okay?! Could I please one of your piping-hot farts in my mouth? Yummy yummy I want your farts in my tummy. Dude! Do not do this! Yes, I know that! Why do you think I've been putting up with his farts?! I know Cartman made it all up, okay?! I also know that nothing is more important for humanity than peace in the Middle East! I'm okay with this, Stan! I'm not a dick, I'm like Gandhi! Okay, okay. Stan, you're right. Maybe I let being a martyr go to my head. Just please, let me stay on this path, and, I'll try to be cool about it. Okay? I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Kenny! Hurray! Please, you have to listen to me! The prophecy actually did come true! Yes! It did! But that ''is'' what happened! It is! Tell them, Cartman! But it's the truth! Ssso it was all for nothing. The whole time I was... eating farts for nothing.
