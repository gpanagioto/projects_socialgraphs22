Looming Sunset Assisted Living center, day. We can surmise from this that Grandpa Marsh was put in this home when Sharon and Randy divorced shortly after Stan's 10th birthday. The family stops by for a visit.

Randy

Well, Dad, it was really great seeing you. We'd love to stay for dinner, but the food here gives Sharon diarrhea.

Sharon

What?! Randy!

Randy

[shushes her] Just trying to leave without being rude.

Marvin

[rolls over to a small table next to the TV. There's a gift-wrapped box on it] Hold on, hold on just a second. I got a present for my grandson. [gets the box and wheels back to the family] Come here, Billy. [meets Stan in the middle of the room] You've grown up, Billy. It's time for you to have somethin' expensive and flashy [Stan smiles and glances back at his parents], to impress all the ladies [Stan takes the gift from him, then looks back at his parents].

Sharon

Go ahead and open it, Stan. [Stan opens the gift as Shelly and his parents surround him. Sharon kneels behind him and looks over his shoulder] Ohoho look at that! A bolo tie! Isn't that beautiful, Stan? [she puts it on him - gold base, turquoise center, diamonds surrounding it (12 small, 24 tiny)]

Marvin

That's 14 karat gold, with turquoise and reeeal diamonds.

Randy

[approaches Marvin] Grandpa, how much did you spend on that?

Marvin

Six thousand dollars.

Randy

Six thousand?!

Marvin

It's worth fifty thousand. The Jewels and Gems Shopping Network said so.

Randy

Dad, you shouldn't be spending your retirement money on frivolous things! You should be saving it for when you die. That's our money!

Sharon

It's gorgeous, Dad, thank you. Oh, and tomorrow's picture day at school! Stan can wear it for his photo!

Marvin

Oh, that's wonderful! That'll make me feel reeeally good. Who's Stan?

-----


The bus stop, next day. It's picture day! Cartman, Kyle, and Kenny are waiting at the bus stop. Stan approaches, wearing the bolo tie, and stands next to the other boys. Cartman studies him at length

Cartman

Nice bolo tie, Stan.

Stan

[looks away to avoid eye contact] Thanks. [Kyle takes notice]

Cartman

Bolo ties are... [quickly glances at Kyle] really in right now. Cool you have one.

Stan

[annoyed] Look, it was a gift from my grandpa, okay? And it cost a lot of money.

Cartman

No, dude, it's... badass.

Stan

[angered] It happens to be worth six thousand dollars!

Kyle

That... was six grand?

Stan

Yeah dude. It's a recreation of the bolo tie worn by King Henry V.

Cartman

...Dude, it's fucking gay as fuck.

Stan

[finally breaks, facepalming] I know! [lowers his right arm] I really wish if my grandpa wanted to give me something, he'd just give me the money!

Kyle

Why don't you take it to one of those pawn places? Every two blocks you see a guy with a sign that says "Cash For Gold and Jewelry." There must be a lot of people doin' it.

-----


Downtown South Park, the jewelry district, day. Outside a Cash For Gold store a man spins a sign around with his hands. Inside, behind a bullet-proof partition, a clerk looks the bolo over with a jeweler's scope

Clerk 1

You didn't steal this, did you?

Stan

No, my grandpa gave to me as a present. But it's worth so much I reel really bad accepting it, so I just want the cash.

Clerk 1

[does some calculations on his computer] It's 14-karat gold, diamond and turquoise. I'll give you fifteen dollars.

Stan

...What? That cost my grandpa six thousand dollars. Those are real diamonds on the outside.

Clerk 1

Yeah, I can't really make anything on the diamonds. I'd have to send it to a smelter, have it all smelted down for the gold, probably could make a ten-dollar profit.

Stan

Fifteen bucks?!

Kyle

Dude, this guy's trying to rook us! We can go someplace else!

Stan

Yeah, I'm not gettin' taken advantage of! [takes back the bolo tie]

Cartman

You may suck our collective balls, sir! [they leave the store, turn right and walk]

Kyle

Don't worry. There's gotta be another cash for gold place around here somewhere.

Stan

Yeah! Here's one. [turns into the next store past the empty lot. The man outside is wearing a signboard]

-----


Inside the second store, a fat blonde woman looks the bolo tie over

Clerk 2

These are real diamonds, right?

Stan

Yeah dude, you can test them.

Clerk 2

Okay. Eight dollars.

Stan

[stunned, then angry] This is the same bolo tie worn by King Henry V!

Clerk 2

[looks it over again] Nine dollars.

-----


Taco Bell, day. No go at the second store, so the boys come here. Outside, a man twirls a sign around which also points to Taco Bell as a cash for gold and jewelry store. The boys go in and get the bolo tie appraised

Clerk 3

Welcome to Taco Bell. Would you like to try our Doritos Locos Tacos?

Stan

I wanna see how much you'll give me for this gold and turquoise diamond bolo. [hands the bolo to the clerk. The clerk looks it over, brings out his own pocket scope, and looks it over more closely]

Clerk 3

Fourteen-karat gold gets yaaa $14 a gram on the open market, got about... 4 grams here... [puts his scope away] It's not really worth my time. I guess I can give you a six-layer burrito for it.

Stan

A six-layer burrito?

Kyle

You guys don't even make a six-layer burrito!

Clerk 3

Alright, a seven-layer burrito! But that's as high as I'm going!

-----


Outside Taco Bell, sitting on a curb

Stan

Dude, my grandpa paid $6000 for something barely worth anything. How? How does something like this happen?

-----


J&G Shopping Network, Jewelry Bonanza with DEAN, Channel 233. The show is already in progress. Dean, dressed in a white Western shirt, shows off his wares

Dean

-----


Cartman's house, day. The boys are looking at Jewelry Bonanza in the living room and have just seen an old woman get swindled out of her money

Kyle

Dude, that's terrible!

Cartman

I told you guys. I've been watching all day.

Stan

But, how do they get away with that?

Cartman

This is a new time. A new era of science that only the smartest can comprehend. [walks out]

Stan

What are you talking about?

Cartman

[standing next to a covered mobile whiteboard] For centuries alchemists have tried to come up with a formula to make gold. Whoever could do it would of course become rich, and now-! The chemical equation is right before our eyes. [unveils the equation]

Kyle

That's the chemical equation for gold?

Cartman

That's right. [goes through and denotes what each letter means] Guys with Cash For Gold Signs gets you People's Unwanted Crappy Jewelry, which when added to a Cable-Based Shopping Network divided by Demented Old people equals... Gold. [writes in an equal sign and "GOLD" at the end]

Kyle

...Kenny, will you tell Cartman to shut up?

Kenny

(Shut the fuck up, dude! You're a fuckin' asshole!)

Cartman

Oh, I'm an asshole for doin' math!

Dean

Oh my gosh, can you believe this? Somebody's about to get this $20,000 topaz and copper ring for just four thousand bucks. [a close-up of the ring] We've got our buyer on the line. You buyin' this as a gift, sir?

Caller

No, I'm buying it as a gift! For my grandson Billy!

Stan

Grandpa? [gets off the sofa and runs out the front door]

Looming Sunset Assisted Living, night. Marvin is watching Jewely Bonanza. Onscreen is a necklace with a large emerald on it

Dean

How about that, folks? That is Brazilian emerald, finest emerald available. We're letting this oen go fer... fourteen ninety five [$1495.00 onscreen], EZ Pay. We call it that to save you time. EZ is an abbreviation of easy. Fourteen ninety five, EZ Pay an... What's that? Okay, alright, I just got word, we are droppin' the Z from EZ Pay. It's now just E Pay. [onscreen EZ Pay is erased, then E Pay appears] By usin' the word E Pay instead of takin' all that time to say EZ Pay, we're savin' you a second of time, and those seconds add up. Go ahead and try it: say E Pay five thousand times. That's five thousand seconds, nine hours... we just saved you here on J&G Shoppin' Network. [Grandpa's eyes begin to wander] Not wastin' your time here, you can't afford not to buy this one. You don't have a lot of time left. Literally. Pass this one down to your kids, your grandkids. [Stan appears at the doorway] Show 'em your life had meaning.

Stan

Grandpa.

Marvin

[turns his head to the left to look at Stan] Well you see that, Billy? That's an emerald on 14 karat gold. Don't you think your sister would like that? [smiles]

Stan

She doesn't like jewelry, Grandpa.

Marvin

Ha! Well she will one day. She'll appreciate it. She's, she's just a baby after all.

Stan

She's not a baby, Grandpa, she's thirteen.

Marvin

Shelly's thirteen? Rihight. Right, boy... [faces the TV again, visibly shaken] Billy, did I ever tell you I used to have a border collie named Patches?

Stan

Yes, Grandpa.

Marvin

[reminiscing with a smile] I loved that dog. She always made me so happy. When she died, I... I didn't let myself get too sad, 'cause I thought, thought I'd always have the memory of her slobberin' happy face. [the smile disappears] I can't remember what she looked like, Billy... Huh. Huohh. [gets a headache and rests his head on his left hand]

Stan

Don't worry, Grandpa. I'm gonna take care of this! [turns to his left and leaves with determination. Marvin is left looking distressed]

South Park Elementary, playground, day. During recess, Butters twirls a sign around, while Cartman is decked out in all sorts of jewelry.

Cartman

Hey Craig. Goin' on? Tolkien! Bet your mom has some old jewelry she wouldn't notice missing. Bebe! You got those rhinestones in your earrings, I'll have some walking cash! I can probably offer you a-

Butters

[loses control of the sign] Whoops! [it lands face up on the snow]

Cartman

[quickly analyzing the situation] Butters, what the fuck?!

Butters

[winces, then massages his right arm] Sorry. My arms hurt.

Cartman

"My arms hurt." Pick the fucking sign up, Butters! This is a business! [Butters picks the sign up and resumes twirling]

Leroy

Hey! How much will you give me for this? [shows him a ring with a huge rock on it]

Cartman

Oh ahhhh, three bucks.

Leroy

Okay. [gives the ring to Cartman, who transfers it to his left hand. Cartman reaches into his back pocket and give Leroy the three dollars. Leroy turns and walks away]

Cartman

We got crappy jewelry Butters. Now all we need are some old people.

-----


Jewelry Bonanza.

Dean

And that's it, we just sold this bracelet to Ms. Marcia Tubbs. Marcia, thank you so much for your call. You just got yourself a heck of a deal on this one. You there Marcia?

Marcia

[over the phone] Yes. [a car honks at her] I'm lost. I'm lost walkin' on the freeway.

Dean

Alright, you're lost walkin' on the freeway? Enjoy the Tiger's Eye Aquamarine bracelet. Alri- okay, what should we do next? Oh I see one. Here's a good'un. Lemme... [picks out a ring with a large yellow stone in the middle] Lemme... lemme set the stage for you here: you're goin' to that seniors' cocktail party? It's bingo night and you're lookin' for somethin' to wear? How about a 13 carat panzoto-panzanite ring. This is-oh! We got a caller already on this one! Hello sir, you must be a fan of panzoto-panzanite.

Stan

Yeah, hi. Um, you should kill yourself?

Dean

...What's that?

Stan

I said, you should kill yourself? What you do is sort of, unjustifiable? And you know it's unjustifiable? And you don't care? You're the definition of evil? Kill yourself?

Dean

Okay, we're gonna sell this ring for just thirty-seven ninety five. [$3,795.00 onscreen] How's that? [puts the ring onto a woman's right ring finger.]

Stan

I just read that the day shopping networks make most of their money is on the day seniors pick up Social Security checks? Kill yourself.

Dean

Alright, well you shouldn't say things like that 'cause... some host of a jewelry channel sure might up and do it, and then you'd feel really bad.

Stan

No I wouldn't.

Dean

Yes you would.

Stan

No, because I really want you to kill yourself.

Dean

Alright, well how about this?! If a jewelry network host goes home tonight and blows the brains out, you might be liable. That's a lawsuit worth ...2.7 million dollars? How's that sound?

Stan

I don't care what happens to me, I care about my grandfather, you morally empty corrupted maggot!

Dean

[long silence as the jewelry carousel goes around] Alright, I tell you what: I'll bring the lawsuit down to twenty-nine thirty-nine- [the $6,000,000 is erased and replaced by $2,939.00]

Stan

Nono, uh it doesn't matter what price you put on anything! Your only chance to right the wrongs you've done, and repay all the elderly people whose lives you've destroyed, is to kill yourself.

Dean

[another long silence, then he clears his throat] Well, you think it's funny, but that's, that's callin' up and tellin' someone to kill themselves; that's not a joke.

Stan

I'm not joking. [pause] Do it.

Eric Jewelry Cavalcade, with Eric. Now on the Old People's Shopping Network, founded by Eric Cartman. He's in his basement, behind a table with his own props and jewelry

Cartman

Okay, next item? Next item we're gonna do is uh, 5 5 2 1 6 uh 7, 7 5, 5 [actually 55-26177] This is-oh my God, look at this you guys.

Do we have the buyer on the line? Hello?

Caller

Hello?

Cartman

YES, you just bought this lovely 200-carat ring. How do you feel, Mrs...?

Mrs. Appleby

This is Mrs. Appleby on 24 Palmark Lane?

Cartman

Can I ask you something, Mrs. Appleby? Do you like fucking little boys?

Mrs. Appleby

[long pause] I'm sorry?

Cartman

Just wondering if you fuck kids all the time, 'cause that's what you just did with this deal. You just got an $8,000,000,000 ring for seventy-five ninety-five. You fucked me good, Mrs. Appleby. Congratulations, ma'am.

Mrs. Appleby

Thank you.

Cartman

Were you just flippin' through the channels and saw me selling this ring and thought "Hm, I'd like to fuck that kid!"

Mrs. Appleby

...I thought it'd be a lovely gift for my granddaughter Jessica. She's captain of the debate team at Jefferson High School. see-

Cartman

Oh-kay, thanks for shopping with us. I gotta get the taste of old lady dick out of my mouth.

Mrs. Appleby

Goodbye.

Cartman

Bye! Man that's good acting. I should get an award.

A smelting plant. Shown is the Oscar for Best Actor: Sean Penn in Milk. The camera pulls back to reveal a pile of gold jewelry on which the Oscar sits. A shovel comes in and scoops it up with some other jewelry. The worker holding the shovel moves it to a vat of molten gold and dumps the jewelry into the vat. Escaping air makes a fart sound as the jewelry sinks into liquid gold, and then some bubbles popping follow

Stan

Do you have any idea what it would feel like to start losing your memories?! No! Because you don't have someone in your life suffering from Alzheimer's! Well I do!

Manager

Look, kid, if you've got a beef with the system, you're talkin' to the wrong people. All we do is smelter down what we get from the cash for gold places.

Stan

Yeah?! Well there's an old Hindu saying: "Whoever smelt it, dealt it!"

Kyle

Yeah!

Kenny

(Fuck yeah!)

Manager

We aren't the ones who denied you what your jewelry was really worth. The Hindu saying is actually "Mayii nahii chahatapahnii"

Kyle

What does that mean?

Manager

"Whoever denied it, [lowers his voice] supplied it." [the boys are stunned]

-----


The neighborhood park, day. Stan is now on a crusade to stop this madness, but he hasn't found the right target. Kyle has his arms crossed

Stan

YOU are the scums of the earth! Old people are victimized by shopping networks and YOU kick back in your fat-cat mansions, making billions!

Butters

[looks around at his fellow sign twirlers] We aren't makin' that much, fellas.

Stan

You're not?

Twirler 1

Who don't you yell at the people who melt the gold down? The old Hindu saying is "Whever smelt it dealt it" [other twirlers agree with him: "Yeah!" "That's right!"]

Kyle

[leans forward] Nuh uh! It's "Whoever denied it, supplied it!"

Twirler 2

You got it all wrong. The jewelry that those shopping networks sell don't even come from us! It's all made in India, where those Hindu rhymes come from!

Twirler 3

What are you saying, Gustav? My God, do you mean?

Twirler 4

That's right. Whoever made the rhyme did the crime.

Gems Wholesale, day. Cartman walks by with a briefcase

Cartman

Suck my balls, suck my balls... [enters the store] Hello!

Clerk 4

[An Asian woman] Ohhhh welcoooome! Welcome to discount jewelry stohhhhh! [her two assistants join her as Cartman takes a seat at the counter]

Cartman

India Manufacturing, Inc., a rainy day somewhere in India. A taxi pulls up to the plant, with Cartman and Butters inside.

Cartman

My balls, my balls, suck 'em dry...[Butters opens his door and hops out, then opens Cartman's door. Cartman looks around and clears his throat to get Butters' attention.]

Butters

Oh sorry, sorry. [looks back at his seat and pulls out the sign. then points it at Cartman. Cartman then hops out and proceeds to the plant, with Butters following]

-----


Inside the plant. All the workers here are children working in cubicles, assembling new jewelry. A supervisor walks by collecting newly finished jewelry in a metal box. The receptionist shows Cartman and Butters in while one boy is sealing packages in another room

Cartman

[to the receptionist] You see, I'm looking to cut out the middle man. I want to buy my jewelry direct from you so that- [a disturbing sight stops him in his tracks] Motherfucker!

Stan

[railing at an older Indian boy] You should be ashamed of the people in America that you are exploiting! How dare you take advantage of those less fortunate?! [Kenny and Kyle are with him]

Cartman

[approaches the other boys] You dirty double-crossing assholes! You're trying to cut me out, huh?! You guys stole my formula, then tried to fuck me- Butters!

Butters

Sorry! [catches up to him]

Cartman

 -and then tried to fuck me out of your business!

Kyle

We're not fucking you, they're fucking Stan's grandpa!

Cartman

No, they're getting fucked by Asian ladies!

Stan

Somebody is at the head of all this, and somebody needs to pay! All I want is some Goddamned retribution for my Goddamned grandpa! [the boy reaches for a necklace and offers it to Stan] No! Not a diamond-and-gold necklace! [the boy thinks about what to do with the necklace, then reaches for a small plastic pouch and puts it in. The boy motions to another boy]

Kyle

What's he doing?

-----


Montage. The boy tosses the necklace into a box being carried by another supervisor, then motions to someone else as the supervisor carries the box away. Outside, several workers load up a truck. The supervisor gives his box to one of the loaders. A planeload of jewelry leaves India and arrives at Atlanta. The box is then shipped by QDC to J&G headquarters. A J&G worker carries a gold ruby necklace to Dean at his Jewelry Bonanza set. He then puts the necklace on camera and sells it to an elderly woman who still lives at home. A FedExX truck arrives at her house and the driver delivers it to her personally. He tips his hat to her as he leaves. She opens the package right then and there, at her front door, and pulls out the necklace. She gives it to her daughter, who is quite happy to get it. The daughter goes to a Cash For Gold store and sells it to the clerk. He puts it into a box containing other jewelry, puts in more jewelry to fill the box up, then delivers it to an Industrial Smelting and Refining plant. He sells it to one of the workers there. The worker brings it into a room and splits the jewelry among his associates. They sort the gems by type as they dismantle the jewelry. The gold is sent to be melted down and made into gold bars. The gold and jewels are sent separately back to India, where an IPS truck goes to India Manufacturing to deliver the raw materials. The workers deliver the materials to the supervisors, who take them inside and distribute them among the child workers. The child workers assemble the raw materials into new jewelry, and the cycle starts again. Back in Atlanta, more packages are delivered to J&G headquarters by E-Z Delivery. A J&G worker delivers a gold amethyst necklace to Dean, who sells it to an elderly couple. An ADL truck arrives and the driver delivers it to the couple. The husband receives it and opens it. The driver tips his hat and leaves. The couple then offer the necklace to their daughter, who's overjoyed to get it. She and her husband take the necklace to a different cash for gold store and sell it to the clerk there. The necklace is dismantled into its various parts and the gold melted down again. IPS delivers the raw materials back to India Manufacturing. A supervisor dumps some gems onto the desk of a different child worker, who is working on a picture frame. He finishes the frame and walks up to the older boy. The older boy takes the picture frame to Stan and gives it to him.

Stan

Oh, yeah. Actually, this might kind of work.

-----


The park surrounding Looming Sunset, day. Stan is visiting Marvin, who's well enough to sit on the bench with him with the use of a cane

Stan

So the we went to India, which is pretty cool I guess. I've never been there before. And we basically learned that whoever smelt it, denied it, and rhymed it actually dealt it.

Marvin

Ahh, sounds like you had a fun weekend.

Stan

Yeah, I guess so. Anyway Grandpa, I wanted to give you something. [hands him the gift]

Marvin

Oh, for me? [takes the gift and unwraps it] Oh! My God. There she is. [a picture of Grandpa in younger days with his dog] Old Patches. There's that slobberin' happy face! Thank you Billy. That means a lot. [they smile at each other for a moment] Billy, that... that bolo tie you're wearing?

Stan

Yeah.

Marvin

I don't know where you got that, but it's fucking gay as fuck.

Stan

Cool. I, I won't wear it anymore.

Marvin

That's a good idea. [looks back at the picture and smiles. Stan looks down and away]

Jewelry Bonanza with Dean. Onscreen is a pair of earrings selling for $2800.00

Dean

Folks, these are not your ordinary peridot craponite earrings, these are 18-karat gold! and we got-oh, do we have a buyer on the line? Hello?

Caller 1

[long pause] What are you waiting for? Kill yourself.

Dean

Alright Goddamnit, we got another comedian. Ever since that little kid called up, now everybody wants to call and tell me I should kill myself.

Caller 1

He was right. Do it.

Dean

Folks, this is an 800 number. Every time you call and tell me to kill myself, it's costing us... two dollars and thirty six cents! So now, how about a caller who wants to buy jewelry ? Yes. Hello, sir?

Caller 2

You're too scared to do it, aren't-cha? You don't have the balls.

Dean

Goddamnit I'm not scared to do it.

Caller 2

New, you're scared. You got, you got lady balls. [hangs up. The dial tone is heard and Dean moves on to the next call]

Caller 3

Hello? I'm calling about the peridot earrings?

Dean

Yes ma'am!

Caller 3

They'd look good on your dead body. Why don't you kill yourself?

Dean

Alright, that's that! That there's the- the straw that broke the camel's back! I got a gun right here; whattaya think about that?!

Caller 3

Put it against your temple and pull the trigger. [long pause. The gun is cocked and then goes off. A thump is heard and blood lands all over the set. The soothing music plays on]
