Tom, I'm standing out in front of Henry's Supermarket where five brave little boys are holding a rally to support gays in scouting. The rally is drawing so much attention that people from all over the country are taking media notice.  The rally has also caught the attention of old Scouts members, like Steven Spielberg, director of such films as ''Always'' and ''1941''. The rally has also caught the attention of high-powered lawyer, Gloria Allred. With this kind of support, Tom, these boys are sure to have a victory for gays. Back to you.
