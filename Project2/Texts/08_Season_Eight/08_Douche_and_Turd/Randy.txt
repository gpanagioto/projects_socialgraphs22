Did you just say that... voting is ridiculous?  You don't see the point! Oh, you young people just make me sick!  You don't care?! You really want a turd sandwich as your school mascot?! On your football helmets?! A turd?! You're crazy!! A d-a douche is at least clean! You don't understand the issues, Sharon! You think the school mascot should be a turd sandwich? Well you're not exactly Einstein! Stanley, when you left for school this morning, you said you were going to vote! Oh! Are you happy now, Stan? You just got yourself suspended! Expulsion?! Our son, banished! Where did we go wrong?!  This is breaking your mother's heart, Stan. She couldn't even help tie you to the horse. Jesus. I guess maybe you'll never understand how important voting is.  That's... one of the hardest things a parent ever has to do.  So who won, Mr. Mackey? Stan! He's going to vote! Hey! That's not true, Stan.  Your vote still mattered.  Now your vote didn't matter.
