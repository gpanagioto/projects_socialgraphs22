+++++


A panoramic view of South Park, day. Holiday music is heard in the background, and the scenes are played out as the narrator mentions them.

Narrator


Way up in the mountains in a small little town,
The Main Street was being decorated all up and down.
People stood in long lines, sometimes waiting hours or more,
Because Christmas needs to be bought in a store.
But out in the forest, not too far away...



+++++


A nearby forest. The camera pans down from the sky and rest upon a Christmas tree. Forest animals gather round and decorate it.

Narrator

...The little woodland critters were also preparing for their Christmas Day.

Woodland Critters


It's almost time when the time is here,
The time that's only once a year.
We can hardly wait, 'cause it's so near.
A Woodland Critter Christmas!



Narrator


The little critters worked hard as they happily sang,
And each one of them had a quite interesting name.
There was Squirrely the squirrel, Rabbity the rabbit,
Beavery the beaver, and Beary the bear.
Porcupiney the porcupine, Skunky the skunk,
Foxy the fox, and Deery the deer.
Woodpeckery the woodpecker, Mousey the mouse,
and Chickadee-y the chickadee, all made the forest their house.
And on that magical day, stumbling upon all of that,
was a surprised little boy, in a red poofball hat.



Stan

[walks by with a sled] What the hell?

Singer


Christmastime is once a year
Every critter holds it dear
Every animal big or small
Christmas means so much to us all



+++++


The forest. The critters approach Stan.

Rabbity

Well, hello there. Welcome to our forest.

Skunky

How do you like our Christmas tree?

Stan

It's... nice.

Beavery

Why, it's the most perfect tree in the forest! [the others cheer]

Mousey

Oh no, I see a problem.

Deery

What is it, Mousey?

Mousey

Our Christmas tree doesn't have a star!

Critters

Awww.

Beary

We can't have a tree with no star on it.

Rabbity

What are we gonna do?

Squirrely

Now don't be down, y'all. Maybe our new friend can help us find a star.

Critters

[among other things] Can you really? Oh would you please? Could you help us?

Stan

Okay, okay.

Critters

[cheering] Yay!

Narrator


And so, using some paper and working with glee,
the boy in the red poofball hat made a star for the tree.



Critters

Ohhhh!

Beary

It's the nicest star I ever saw.

Narrator

The little critters cheered and Beavery said with a smile...

Beavery

How would you like to sing and dance with us for a while?

Narrator

The boy in the red poofball hat smiled and said...

Stan

[doesn't smile] Uh, no thanks, I'm gonna go home. [turns around, picks up the reins on his sled and walks off]

Beavery

Goo- goodbye Stanny!

Critters

Goodbye, Stanny! Bye! Cya! I'll buy your hat!

Stan

Woof.

+++++


Stan's bedroom, night. He's asleep in bed, but wakes up, turns over, and turns on his light.

Critters

Hi, Stanny!

Stan

Oh, whatta? [squeezes his eyelids shut]

Narrator


His friends were all there! What a wonderful surprise!
The little boy smiled with joy in his eyes!



Stan

[irritated, grabs his clock] What time is it?!

Squirrely

You aren't gonna believe what happened, Stanny. It's the most magical Christmas gift ever!

Skunky

Porcupiney is pregnant!

Stan

[sighs] You guys, I have to go to school tomorrow.

Mousey

I deduce the man-boy doesn't understand the seriousness of the fertilization.

Deery

Porcupiney is a virgin, Stanny. Her conception was immaculate.

Foxy

She's gonna give birth to our Lord and Savior.

Stan

...What?

Porcupiney

It has been foretold unto me that I would give birth on Christmas Day.

Mousey

So soon!

Skunky

How delightful!

Woodpeckery

Our souls are saved!

Chickadee-y

Finally the critters are gonna have a Savior of their very own, of their very own! [they all cheer]

Squirrely

[hops onto Stan's bed] There's just one problem: We don't have a manger for our Savior to be born in.

Critters

Awwww.

Beary

But we got to have a manger.

Rabbity

Can you do it, Stan. Can you build us a manger? Huh?

Critters

(Cheers)

Narrator


"Of course I'll build you a little manger!" the little boy cried,
and he winked at his critter friends and leapt to their side!



+++++


The forest. Stan has built the manger and is hammering the last few nails in place.

Narrator


And out in the woods the boy steamed right ahead,
making a place for the critter babe to lay its sweet head.



Rabbity

Gee whiz, if it isn't the nicest manger I ever saw.

Mousey

I deduce it shall serve as a perfectly suitable resting place, for the Son of our Lord.

Raccoony

Does this mean we can go to sleep now?

Porcupiney

My son will have the nicest bed in all the forest.

Woodpeckery

Fit for a king!

Squirrely

This is going to be the best critter Christmas ever!

Woodland Critters


It's almost time when the time is here,
The time that's only once a year.
We can hardly wait, 'cause it's so near --



Stan

[as they sing] All right, I'm going now. [He ambles off. A roar is heard nearby. All stop and look. The critters scream.]

Critters

The mountain lion! Hide! [They scatter, leaving Stan to face the lion alone. The lion peers out from behind a tree.]

Stan

Go away! Shoo! [The lion moves off and the critters return.]

Squirrely

Is it gone?

Mousey

I deduce it is.

Skunky

[behind a low tree] I'm not c-c-comin' out.

Foxy

Well, this is the end. The mountain lion obviously knows Porcupiney is pregnant, and he's gonna kill it again.

Stan

Again?

Squirrely

Every Christmas the mountain lion comes down and eats the virgin critter impregnated with the Son of our Lord.

Porcupiney

Oh dear, I'm so very afraid.

Beavery

[climbs onto a stump and sits up] Let's face it. The mountain lion will never let our Savior be born.

Critters

Awwww! [some of them sob]

Squirrely

Hey, we shouldn't be upset this Christmas. We've got Stanny!

Raccoony

Of course! Stanny can do anything! If he can build a manger, he can stop that mean ol' mountain lion!

Porcupiney

Christmas is saved! [the critters cheer]

+++++


The camera looks up from the woods to a mountain in the distance. Dramatic music plays.

Narrator


High up in the forest on a dark, craggy peak,
the horrid mountain lion and preyed on the weak.
For the critters to be saved, someone had to stop that nasty old cat...



Stan

Goddammit, this is fucking ridiculous!

Narrator

Said the little boy in the red poofball hat.

Narrator


Killing a mountain lion was no easy task,
But he thought of a plan, and he thought of it fast.



Stan

[gesturing] Grrr! Grrr! Come on out! [The lion is heard roaring from inside the cave, and it roars. It approaches the entrance.] Come on, critter killer! Your days of slaughtering innocent little animals are over! Rawrrrrr! [Anticipating the lion's leap, he runs off. The lion lunges at him, but misses. Stan moves to the side of the peak and turns, gesturing.] Rawrrrrr! [Stan runs up the side of the peak, and the lion follows. Stan reaches the peak and turns to face the lion. The lion lunges at Stan again. Stan drops out of the way and the lion goes over the peak and onto its death below, at the cave entrance.]

Narrator


In a flash, it was over! A victorious blow!
The mountain lion lay slain on the cold ground below.



+++++


The cave entrance. Stan sees that the mountain lion is motionless and approaches.

Stan

Okay, there. [three lion cubs approach the entrance]

Lion cub 1

Mommy? Mommy! [they rush up to her body] W... wake up, Mommy, wake up!

Lion cub 2

Don't leave us, Mommy. [Stan realizes that this dangerous mountain lion was a mom, so his jaw drops. The pale cub approaches him.] Man-boy, why? Why did you kill our mommy? Why?

Stan

[at a loss for words] I... the... critters. Their... bir-birth of a Savior? [The cubs snuggle close to their mom's body, sobbing.]

Narrator


The tiny cubs all gathered together and cried,
All alone in the world because their mother had died.



Stan

[turns away and squeezes his eyes shut] Aw- awww!

+++++


The forest floor, night. The critters have set up a campfire close to the manger and are keeping warm by it.

Porcupiney

[feeling a kick] Oooo.

Beary

You all right, Lady Porcupiney?

Porcupiney

Oh yes, just felt a little kick is all.

Beavery

Well, it's been much too long now. Uh I'm afraid our helpful friend Stanny must be very dead.

Foxy

Yep, the mountain lion probably swallowed him whole.

Rabbity

I guess that means our Savior is gonna be made into Savior stew.

Critters

Awwww.

Chickadee-y

[flitting straight up into the air] Wait a minute, look! [the animals turn to see Stan approaching them]

Critters

Stanny! [they gather in front of him]

Mousey

Stanny, you're alive.

Beary

But, does that mean you killed the mountain lion?

Stan

It's dead.

Deery

For real and for true?

Beavery

Are you sure?

Stan

I'm sure. It won't be hurting you anymore.

Squirrely

He did it! Now our Critter Christmas can finally happen! Hail Satan!

Critters

Hail Satan!

Stan

Wait, wha-what?

Beavery

You've done us a huge favor, Stanny! Without the mountain lion around, the Lady Porcupiney can give birth to the Antichrist!

Critters

Yaaay!! [they head over to the manger]

Stan

Wai-wait, the Antichrist?? You said she was giving birth to your savior!

Squirrely

Yeah, to the Son of our Lord, Satan, Prince of Darkness.

Stan

But I thought you meant the Son of God!

Deery

Well, think about it: You really think God would have sex with a porcupine?

Chickadee-y

No way! Only Satan, Prince of Darkness and King of all Evil would do that! Yay!

Foxy

This just calls for a celebration! Let's sacrifice Rabbity and eat his flesh!

Rabbity

Yay! Sacrifice me to the Devil!

+++++


The other critters cheer. Stan is frozen stunned as Beary pulls up a Satanic altar on a small wagon with a little help from Squirrely. The other animals bring Rabbity up to the altar. Rabbity is propped up on the altar and Beary tears him apart with a sacrificial blade. The other animals crowd in, tear away pieces of the body, and eat them raw.

Chickadee-y

Drink his blood! Drink his blood!

Squirrely

[jumps into a puddle of blood] Blood orgy!

Critters

Yay, blood orgy! Blood orgy, yay!

+++++


The critters drench themselves in Rabbity's blood and begin the orgy. Beavery mounts Raccoony, Skunky mounts Porcupiney, Mousey mounts foxy, and Beary mounts Deery. Squirrely hops onto Deery's left ear and mounts that. Chickadee-y and Woodpeckery start flitting around. In the background is heard "Sting, so true!" Stan stares, traumatized.

Critters


What special time and special day,
It's Woodland Critter Christmas.



Squirrely

[a circular window opens and he pops up] Hail Satan.

+++++


The forest floor, night. The critters return to the manger and decorate it with Satanic symbols, including (what is presumably) Rabbity's skull. As the narrator speaks, the following takes place. The star atop the manger is turned so it points down. Owls bring flowers to the mountain lion's corpse. The lion cubs are shown, then the mountain peak, then Stan is shown with his head buried into his arms at his desk in his room.

Narrator


In the gentle forest clearing on Christmas Eve morn,
The little forest critters prepared for the Antichrist to be born.
The noble mountain lion had stopped evil in all the years past,
But now the good protector lay dead as the good owls amassed.
And meanwhile, three lion cubs were crying away.
For them, there would certainly be no Christmas Day.
And soon the forest would suffer from the offspring Satan begat.
All of this because of the little boy in the red poofball hat.



Stan

Ugh.

Narrator


Now that he'd killed the noble lion queen,
there was nobody to stop the Apocalypse, it seemed.



Stan

Uuugh!

Narrator


"I know!" he said with a new happy grin,
"I'll go back to the forest and speak with those critters again!"



Stan

[waves the narrator away and leaves his desk] No, no-no-no.

Narrator


He ran out the living room, turned out the light,
and went back to the forest to set everything right!
[Stan enters the living room, hops on the sofa, and turns on the TV. "The Jeffersons" theme song is heard.]
And went back to the forest to set everything right!
[Stan ignores the narrator and continues to watch the TV.]
He tried to forget all about it by watching TV,
But his conscience caught up with him and to the forest he did flee...
[He turns the volume up to drown out the narrator, but to no avail.]
He thought he could hide from his problems - not true!
[Stan rolls his eyes]
He knew in his heart the thing he had to do!



Stan

Leave me alone!!

Narrator

He knew that only by going to the forest could he --

Stan

All right, all right, all right! God! [He turns off the TV, hops off the sofa and walks out the door, leaving the remote control on the floor.]

+++++


The manger at the forest clearing, day. The animals continue decorating.

Beavery

[looks around] Hey, look everyone! It's our old pal, Stanny. [the other critters turn and look]

Woodpeckery

Oh boy, Stanny. You came just in time!

Deery

Yeah. We've got a big problem.

Squirrely

The Great Satan has commanded that when the Antichrist is born, we must find a human host body to transfer it into.

Chickadee-y

That way he could take over the whole world! The whole world!

Mousey

The human must be non-baptized and heathenistic against Christ.

Beavery

We figured you'd be perfect!

Critters

Yay!

Stan

I'm not a heathen! I was baptized and my family's Christian!

Critters

Awwwww.

Beary

But we got to have a human host body for the Antichrist.

Deery

Oh dear, maybe we won't have a critter C-Christmas after all.

Squirrely

Now don't be down, y'all. Stanny can help us find non-baptized heathen human.

Chickadee-y

Will you really, Stanny?

Stan

No! I'm not doing you anymore favors and I'm not letting you give birth to the Antichrist! [walks off] I came here to put a stop to all this!

Beavery

To stop us?

Beary

But gee whiz, Stan, if you try to stop us, we'd have to use our evil Satanic powers on ya.

Stan

Right, whatever. [turns around] I'm taking down the manger I built. [Beary's eyes turn red and brighten. A wall of hellfire appears before Stan.] Ah! [The wall gets higher.] Aaaah! [All the critters' eyes are flashing a bright red. Black crows swoop down and attack Stan.] Aagh! Aaaahh! [A two-headed demon dog appears snarling at him; he runs off in terror.] AAAAAAAH! AAAAAAAH! [The critters' eyes revert back to normal.]

Beary

Oh boy! Our Satanic powers sure did the trick!

Chickadee-y

Our powers get stronger every day! Get stronger every day!

Squirrely

Sorry Stanny, but you see, nothing can stop the birth of the Antichrist, except for a mountain lion.

Skunky

And you got rid of her.

Critters

Yay!

Narrator


The boy shook with anger! He broke a sweat and fell ill.
Then he remembered there were three mountain cubs still alive on the hill!



Stan

Oh yeah.

+++++


The mountain peak, day. Stan climbs up to the cave again.

Stan

Hello? Anybody in there? [the three cubs appear at the entrance of the cave]

Lion cub 3

Oh no, it's the man-boy who killed Mommy!

Lion cub 1

He's come to kill us now!

Lion cub 2

It's okay. I died inside when Mommy was killed anyways.

Lion cub 3

Yeah, better this than the slow death we'd face without a mother around.

Stan

Look, I'm sorry I killed your mom. The, the squirrel told me she was evil.

Lion cub 1

You got tricked by a squirrel? Gee, you're not too smart, are you, mister?

Stan

I'm trying to make this all right again, but the only thing that can stop devil-worshiping critters is a mountain lion!

Lion cub 3

Yeah, and you killed her.

Stan

Well, you're mountain lions.

Lion cub 2

Us? No, we're just kids. We still have our baby teeth.

Lion cub 1

And our baby claws.

Lion cub 3

And a dead mom.

Stan

There still has to be a way for you to kill the porcupine's baby.

Lion cub 3

What? You mean like in an abortion?

Lion cub 2

Yeah. An abortion. That can work.

Lion cub 1

But, we don't know how to give abortions.

Lion cub 3

Do you know some place we can learn, mister?

Narrator


"Where can they learn that?" the boy said with a frown.
"I know! The abortion clinic just outside of town."



Stan

[cross] What?!

Narrator


So he picked up the cubs and down the mountain he stormed.
And took them to where abortions are performed.



Stan

No, he didn't.

Narrator

Yes, he did.

Stan

No, he didn't!

Narrator

Yes, he did.

Stan

No, he didn't!

Narrator 

Yes... he... [Next scene has Stan holding the cubs at the abortion clinic as the doctor there prepares to abort a baby.] did!

Stan

Oh, Goddammit! [the doctor and patient are startled]

Narrator

Said the boy in the red poofball hat! "We've made it already, little cubs! Fancy that!"

Doctor

[walks over] Excuse me, what are you doing here?!

Narrator

The abortion doctor inquired.

Doctor

If you wanna be in the OR, a pass is required!

Stan

I don't know, I- I'm supposed to show these mountain lions how an abortion is performed or something, I... I know, it's ridiculous.

Doctor


Well, you're in luck, I'm happy to inform!
It's only three days until Christmas, so I have lots of abortions to perform!
Gather around my table, cute little lions,
I'll teach you to do abortions without even tryin'!



Narrator


And so the little boy and the cubs gathered around the chair base,
And all day watched abortion after abortion take place.



+++++


Montage. The doctor puts on his gloves and the cubs peer into the patient's vagina. Stan peers in as well, from a distance. The doctor works away happily and cleans up well. The patient leaves, and the next one is worked on. Lion cub 2 is on a desk next to a bottled fetus. He hops off, knocking the bottle off as well. The bottle pops open and the fetus falls out. Everyone turns and sees the fetus on the floor, and laugh about it. The doctor works on the next patient and Lion cub 3 brings him some forceps. The doctor smiles and strokes the cub's head. The other two cubs snuggle up to the patient on her shoulders, and she smiles at them.

Singer


Christmas time is once a year.
Every critter holds it dear.
Every animal big or small,
Christmas means so much to us all.
It's once a year, it's Christmastime!
And it happens once a year.
It's once a year, it's Christmastime!
When we hear about how Christmas only comes
Once a year.



Stan

This better have a point, dude. This really better have a point.

+++++


The forest floor. The critters walk along singing their Christmas tune.

Critters


It's almost time when the time is here,
The time that's only once a year.



Beary

Oh look. That little feller is all alone.

Skunky

Gee, he looks sad. [Kyle is seen kneeling next to his sled, looking sad.]

Critters

Hi there!

Kyle

[gets up and turns around] What the hell?

Beavery

How come you're all alone on Christmas Eve.

Kyle

My... family doesn't celebrate Christmas.

Raccoony

Aww, but why?

Kyle

Well, because, we don't really... believe in Jesus.

Critters

[cheering] Yay!

Beary

But does that mean you aren't baptized?

Kyle

No. I'm Jewish.

Critters

[exulting] Yay! Yay! [they gather around Kyle]

Beavery

You've got to come with us!

Deery

You're perfect! Just pu-perfect!

Kyle

Huh?

Critters

[taking him away] Yay! Woohoo! Woohoohoo!

Critters


What special time and special day,
It's Woodland Critter Christmas.



Squirrely

[a circular window opens and he pops up] Hail Satan.

+++++


The woods, night. The camera pans along to reveal a glowing red pentacle in the starry sky.

Narrator


'Twas the night before Christmas, and above the woods, way up high,
a new bright shiny star hung in the sky.
For the world to be saved there was only one shot,
A little boy with three cubs and an abortion plot.



Stan

Okay, come on, the critters are over this way. You mountain lions ready to stop the Antichrist from being born?

Lion cub 3

Sure. We know how to give abortions now.

Narrator


He arrived at the critter forest ready to fight,
but then gasped when he saw a most dreadful sight.



+++++


The critters are standing around the manger. A grotesque creature lies in the cradle.

Beavery

Gosh, we did it!

Squirrely

The critter Antichrist is born, bringin' a thousand years of darkness to the forest. [The Antichrist growls and throws little fits.]

Narrator


The Antichrist had been born, sealing the world's fate.
The boy in the red poofball hat... was too late.



Stan

Too late?! The hell is that?!

Beavery

Oh. Hiya, Stanny!

Kyle

[now tied to the altar, frightened] Stan! Stan, what the hell is going on?!

Stan

It's Critter Christmas, dude! It sucks ass!

Skunky

Now all we have to do is put the Antichrist into our human host.

Critters

Let's go! All right! Woohoo!

Stan

[turns to the lion cubs] That's it?! Ten thousand years of darkness and I don't even have a Merry Christmas?! [Skunky, Squirrely, Beary, and Chickadee-y walk over to get Kyle. Santa's sleigh appears in the sky.]

Narrator


When up in the sky the sound of sleigh bells were heard,
And a jolly red sleigh flew down to the earth like a bird!



Beavery

Wow, look, there's Santy Claus!

Critters

[cheering] Yay!

Raccoony

Let's eat his flesh! [the sleigh lands and rolls to a stop]

Santa

[hops out] All right, what the hell is going on?! Why is there a red star glowing in the sky?!

Raccoony

We finally did it, Santa! We brought forth the Antichrist with help from our good friend, Stanny.

Skunky

Death and pain await all living things.

Santa

Little boy, you should be ashamed!

Stan

I mean, I didn't mean to help them, I... I tried to stop them!

Santa

Well good going, stupid! There's only one way to stop devil-worshiping critters! [He reaches back and whips out a long shotgun. He fires, and the top half of Beavery's head is gone.]

Critters

Aaaaah! [They scatter. Santa fires again, and Deery goes down. Two more shots and the tops of Raccoony's and Skunky's heads come off.]

Stan

Dude, what the- ? [Squirrely activates his demon power with the red glow from his eyes and a wall of hellfire appears before Santa.]

Singers

Hold steady, Santa.

+++++


Santa simply hops over it, gets into position, and fires at Squirrely, blowing him to smithereens.

Stan

[goes to untie Kyle from the altar] Come on, dude. [Santa continues firing at the remaining critters. Porcupiney is blown apart, then Foxy.]

Beary

Gee whiz, Santa, you're not gonna kill me, are you- [His head is blown off and he goes down.]

Lion Cub

But Santa, what do we do about the Antichrist? [Stan and Kyle join Santa and the cubs.]

Santa

Don't worry, boys. The Antichrist cannot survive without a human host body to go into.

Kyle

[looks down] No. [walks towards the manger] No, I want to have the Antichrist inside me!

Stan

What?! Kyle?!

Kyle

[now in the manger, behind the trough] With his power, I can finally make the earth a better place for the Jews!

Santa

Don't do it, Kyle! [Grinning evilly, Kyle holds the little Antichrist in his left hand. A glow emanates from the Antichrist and its spirit floats out of its body and into Kyle's chest.]

Stan

Dude!

Kyle

[returns to the altar, climbs up, and exults] Yes, yes! Now the Jews shall take control of Christmas once and for all! HAHA! HAAA!!

Kyle

[voice-over] Oh, stop it, Cartman! [the spell is broken]

+++++


Mr. Garrison's class, day. All the students are seated, and it turns out they're taking turns telling Christmas stories. Cartman is telling his now.

Kyle

Just stop it! That's enough! You aren't reading another sentence of your stupid story!

Cartman

I don't believe anyone interrupted you when you read your Christmas story aloud, Kyle. [behind him on the board is written "Write Your Own Christmas Story Day"]

Kyle

This whole time your stupid story was just a way to rip on me for being Jewish at Christmas again!

Cartman

Mr. Garrison, could you do something, please?

Mr. Garrison

Sorry, Eric, but if Kyle feels discriminated against, you'll have to stop or else I'll get a call from his mother.

Cartman

[closes his booklet] All right, fine! Forget it! [He drops off the stool and heads for his desk.]

Butters

Well but, but what happened?

Tolkien

Yeah. Did Kyle bring a thousand years of darkness or not?

Clyde

What happens to the lion cubs?

Cartman

Well, I guess we'll never know, because Kyle doesn't wanna hear how it ends.

Stan

No, it all worked out, right? The world was saved and I went home for Christmas dinner.

Kyle

Dude, why do you care?!

Stan

Well, after all that, I at least wanna know if I had a merry Christmas or if darkness rules the Earth.

Kyle

Oh come on! It's obvious what happens! I get killed by Santa Claus so that Christmas is saved!

Cartman

That's not at all what happens.

Butters

Aw well, come on. Let him read us the end.

Clyde

Yeah yeah, come on! [the other kids chime in]

Kyle

All right, fine!

Cartman

[He returns to the stool and resumes the story. He clears his throat.] "Oh dear, my best friend is possessed! How about that?" said the little boy in the red poofball hat.

+++++


The spell is restored. Kyle is back on the altar exulting.

Kyle

HAHAHAA! Now I shall rule the -- [feels something...] Aww. Uuugh. God it burns! AAAH! My soul is on fire! Whoa! Oh, I don't like this! [hops off the altar] I didn't know it would feel so... dark and evil!

Stan

Well what did you expect, dude? It's the son of the Devil.

Kyle

Oh God, what have I done?! [sits down] I'm sorry. Please, I don't wanna be the vessel for the Antichrist.

Santa

[with his shotgun at the ready] I'm sorry, but it's too late, Kyle! Santa's gonna have to kill you! [pumps the shotgun]

Stan

No Santa, don't!

Santa

We don't have a choice. In a few hours, the dark creature inside him will consume his soul.

Narrator


The little boy fretted. He almost started to bawl,
But that's when he came up with the best idea of all.



Stan

The lion cubs!

Narrator

The little boy quickly begun,

Stan

I took them to see how abortions are done.

Santa

What?

Stan


Now cubs, do like they showed you. Hurry up fast!
Get the Antichrist out of my friend Kyle's ass!



Narrator


And in the twinkling starlight, each little cub did their portion.
They remembered all they had learned and gave Kyle an abortion.



+++++


The lion cub 3 is deep in Kyle's ass, retrieving the Antichrist with his teeth. He succeeds and takes it to Santa quickly. Santa takes it and sets it down on a tree stump. Santa grabs a large sledgehammer next to the stump, raises it over his head, and bring it down upon the Antichrist, smashing it to bits with a loud THUD.

Kyle

Thanks, everybody. I'm sorry I got a little crazy there.

Santa

Well little boy, it seems that you [points to Stan] have really been through a lot. Is there any special present you would like this year?

Stan

[smiles] Yeah. Yeah, there is.

+++++


The lions' cave. Santa arrives at the corpse of the mountain lioness and moves his hand over it, releasing some magic dust and watching it settle. The lioness stirs.

Mother lion

Wha -- Oh my, what happened?

One of the cubs

[the three of them run up to greet her] Mommy?

The cubs

Yay! You're back! We missed you, Mommy!

Stan

[as credits roll]
Christmastime is once a year,
Every creature holds it dear,
