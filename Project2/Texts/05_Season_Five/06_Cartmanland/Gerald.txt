Oh, look, Kyle. Your little friend Stan is here to see you. Kyle, y-you-you just don't understand. It's-- Hello, Kyle. How's the hemorrhoid today? Oh, I think you'll see differently after hearing this. Sit down, Kyle.  He was the most upright and honorable of men, and every day he praised God.  But Satan said, "Oh yeah? He only praises you because you gave him so much. If you didn't give him those things, he would curse your name." And so, God had a bunch of barbarians come in and slaughter Job's oxen and donkeys, and murder all his workers.  And then, as Job's sons and daughters were eating, God sent a mighty wind to collapse the house and crush and kill them all.  So then, Job got painful sores all over his body.  God said to Satan, "See? I told you. Job still praises me."  Oh. Uhhh, I don't know. Isn't he responding at all, doctor?
