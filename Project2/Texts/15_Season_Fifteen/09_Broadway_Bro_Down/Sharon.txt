Nono, I'm good, thanks. Oho that was so much fun! All the costumes and the sets were amazing! I really love the songs. That Stephen Schwartz is a genius! I've got them all stuck in my head.   What?? Randy, are you serious?? Oh my God, first you take me to Wicked and now this? No, no, little Larry is really making Shelly come out of her shell too. That's what we're doing, putting our faith in Randy's new musical. Oho, more than a chance. Randy's actually having a meeting right now with Stephen Sondheim. Hey hun. Ruhur-Randy, it's fine. You do plenty with me. Did you have a good time? Oho Randy, that's great! I'm really proud of you. Of course not, go ahead, hun. I'm just gonna wait up for Shelly. I gave her those tickets to "Wicked."  She's seeing it with her little boyfriend. Yeah, her and little Larry Feegan. They're going to see "Wicked" together. It's Shelly's first Broadway musical. Randy, slow down! Jesus Christ! Why does it matter?! Too young?! That's it, Randy! Turn this car around right now! WHY?!  That's ridiculous! Musicals don't make me wanna give blowjobs! Yes. Oh... Well, yeah, but- Oh my gosh. Nuh-nn No, this is crazy! Musical theater people are respected. Refined. Cultured. It can't be! I've loved Broadway musicals ever since I saw "Grease" with Jacob Harrison and his brother Kip and we-  Oh my God! AAAA! Randy!  Randy, what are you doing?! I don't know if I can really be that mad at you for doing something every guy in America does.  the bottom line is I love going to those shows. If the fallout from that is I make you really happy for a while, well, I guess they're actually a pretty magical thing. So, what Broadway show do you think is coming to Denver next?
