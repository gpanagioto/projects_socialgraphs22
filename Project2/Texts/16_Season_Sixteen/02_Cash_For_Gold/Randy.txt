Well, Dad, it was really great seeing you. We'd love to stay for dinner, but the food here gives Sharon diarrhea.  Just trying to leave without being rude.  Grandpa, how much did you spend on that? Six thousand?! Dad, you shouldn't be spending your retirement money on frivolous things! You should be saving it for when you die. That's ''our'' money!
