Hello, boys. Ooooh, he's just been feeling under the weather. Maybe you boys can cheer him up. He's in the backyard. How is your beefy roast, snookums? Sure, hon. Uh huuuh. Yyeess?? Well, what's your question, hon? Oooooohh. Ooohh, hhmmm . Wwell - yyou see, Eric, sometimes when a man and a woman are... attracted to each other, they want to be... close to each other. And sometimes the man puts his who-who-dilly in the woman's cha-cha. Eric, the day I met your father it was like - magic! It was a beautiful autumn night when the aspen trees were turning, at the Twelfth Annual Drunken Barn Dance. I was young and naive then... And then I saw ''him''. He was the most beautiful, charming piece of ass I'd ever seen in South Park. His name... was Chief Running Water.  I don't recall exactly how the rest of the night went, but the next morning I was pregnant with you, my little blueberry muffin. Oh I never saw him after that. Ah-I wasn't really that interested in him. I heard he still lives on the Ute reservation just outside of town.
