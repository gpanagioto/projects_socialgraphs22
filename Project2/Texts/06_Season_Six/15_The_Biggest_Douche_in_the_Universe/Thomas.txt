Junior! Aw, son, it's good to see you now. Well come on in out of the cold now.  Well, look what the cat dragged in, Nellie. And is this the children you told us about? Well, let's see here now.  Yeup! There's definitely more than one children in there. Nellie, you best have at it now. Alright, children, stand up on this chair now. Yes, right now.  In the name of all that is holy we demand this spirit be set free! There we go! We're gettin' somethin' now! Come on out hyow! It's safe!   It's almost done. Alright, son. Now bring me the victim child! Yeah. You know, the child that we sacrifice so we can put Kenny's soul into its body.  God-damnit! The spirit's out and it don't have no where to go! Well come on, the soul's in here! It can't escape now.  It's goin' to the light! Unfortunately, it's the livin' room light. Go on now, soul now! Now don't go offerin' the soul no tree-fiddy, woman! Well I know, but you can at least start at about two quarter or somethin'  Aw Christmas, there it goes again! Over here! Oh. Well. I guess the child's a pot roast now.
