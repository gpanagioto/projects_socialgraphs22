Why can't it be Mosquito and Friends? Have, so. There's like a big fire or something in town. And friends! Yeah, I almost got in trouble for it. ...You want us to take naked pictures of Butters to use as blackmail? That doesn't sound very superhero-like. Nono, look. what's going on down in the Gulf is much more important than blackmailing another hero. I think we should help raise money for the relief aid by having a bake sale. I have a recipe for lemon bars from my mom. We could wear our costumes outside the grocery store and sell lemon bars. Which would be a good deed, and help people. And that's another thing: no more picking on Mint-Berry Crunch! No, but we are all equal! From now on, we vote! Who wants to go with my plan?   Right.
