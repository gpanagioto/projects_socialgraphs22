Eric Cartman, I told you to get ready for bed! No, Eric! This is a school night! You most certainly are! Right now, mister! Eric, where did you get that? Eric, you march right up to your room, and you- Eric, you get your butt to bed!  I told you to go upstairs right now! I'm not going to tell you again, Eric! It is time... for night-night!  I am your mother, and you will do what I tell you! Well then, you go right now, Mister!  Alright then. No comic books, just straight to sleep! I love you, sweetie.
