Oh, Terrance, You farted in court. Yes, please. The monkey claw is smelly. My sentiments exactly, Your Honor. I see from your actions that you're ''southern'' Canadian. Good people of the jury. My client, Terrance, is an innocent man.  I have, haven't I, Terrance? Good people of the jury. My client, Terrance, is no more a murderer than you or me. He loves puppies and hates mean things. Would a murderer go to the zoo and feed animals like this? Of course not. So in summation, find Terrance innocent. Or else he'll kill you. Just kidding. The defense rests. Did you hear that, Terrance? You're not guilty. Hear hear. Oh, hello, Scott. No hard feelings, right, old pal? 'Cause you're a dick? Cancer? Yes, perhaps he's homophobic. We're not?  Yes. It's been a long day, and only Kraft Dinner can calm my nerves. He sure does seem to hate us. I wonder what he'll try to do next. The subway certainly is wonderful, Terrance. Yes, let's look for treasure. Oh. Hello, Ugly Bob. Ugly Bob, your face looks like somebody tried to put out a forest fire with a screwdriver. Wait wait. I've got an idea. Why don't you put this paper bag over your head, Ugly Bob? Hello Barky. Hello Purry. Say Terrance, I was just aboot to make some Kraft Dinner. Would you like some? I'll take that. Ooh, Terrannce!  You got a letter! What is it, Terrance? Did you fart? Not Sally! Dear God, no, Terrance! Why Sally? God, why? Say, Terrance, who's Sally? I never know you had a daughter, Terrance. No, you never did, Terrance. My God, what a fascinating story, Terrance. Especially the part aboot Celine Dion. Then I'll go with you, Terrance. Well, you know what they say: A friend in need is a friend with Kroff Dinner. Hello, Ugly Bob. Dammit man!  Danger or no, I'm going to help my friend find his daughter!! Oh good. Well, I certainly am going to miss Canada, Terrance. Terrance, if I die whilst in Iran, please bring my body back to Canada, and bury me in a box with a side of Kroff Dinner. Burned your face. Oh, look. There she is. Say, she looks a lot more like Celine Dion than you, Terrance. Oh, now I see the resemblance! Oh, raspberries, looks like I'm losing a friend. Oh my God!  What is this?! Is this Canada? This is madness! I don't know, Terrance. And who is that smelly person in all these pictures? Oh my God, it's Ugly Bob!! Because that's his name, you stupid bitch! Behold his horrible face. Ohh, the humanity!! Yes. I agree whole-fartedly. Wait, what were you saying? What are you doing, Scott? Cancer?! Hey, don't give ''me'' cancer! Hey, Terrance, let's watch American television. Oh look. Here's a show.  Goddamn, their TV shows are lame! Look at their silly American heads. Yes it is, Terrance. According to that newsie, he's some kind of Turkish dictator. That fart sounded like a ringing phone, Terrance. Tell him he's a smelly bastard. Well, while we're waiting, why don't we search for treasure? No, we're searching for treasure. What do you mean? You mean, we are to blame?! What is this? For Canada, Terrance. Yes. This bomb will blow us both to smithereens. But we really have no choice. Only our deaths can bring Canada life. Hey! Wait a minute. That fart gives me pause. That smelly Saddam Hussein. He uses germ and chemical warfare, does he not? Terrance! Get the phone book! We must call every Canadian we can! I do, Terrance. Yes. Prepare the alert! Oh, Glorious Day!  Don't touch me, Ugly Bob! We came up with a better plan. You see, Scott, after all your criticism, it was farting that saved Canada.
