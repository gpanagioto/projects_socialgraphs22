I'm going home for a minute. I have to go to the bathroom. I have to go number two. No way, dude! What would I wipe with? Well what do I sit on?  Urgh. Come on, now. Stop, you guys! I can't think! I have to think about... planes dropping bombs, and dump trucks, and self-serve ice cream...  Oh, that did it.  What the? Oh my God! Come on, you guys, come look at this!  You guys, get over here! I'm serious now!  Look. Over by those bushes. Come on! Let's kill it!   Come on, you guys! Heheh. Hey-heh, that thing's funny.  No! No. Don't. I like it. Wow! Cool! Sweet.  Mom, somebody's at the door. Should I get it? Okay. Okay, okay, hold your horses! God!  Mom, it's another Stark's Pond creature! You mean the other jakovasaur? ''You're'' a jakovasaur; that's what they call you. But the other jakovasaur talked different. I have to call my friends over; they're never gonna believe it. He's the last of his kind, you guys. There's only two of them left.  Will you stop with the whole "mom smoking crack" thing?! It's a old joke! No, that was a jakovasaur. It's okay to come in.  Jakov, I want you to meet my friends. Hahahahaheh, isn't he funny? We have to take him to that rancher's barn to see his girlfriend. No! Why don't you wanna to understand? We have to do this ourselves.  Haaahahahah. You're so funny, Jakov.  "Thank you, Mayor, for this distinctive honor..." I'm preparing my speech for when they call me up to congratulate on me on my discovery. "Thank you, Mayor, for this distinctive honor..."  Thank you, Mayor, for this honorable distinction. You know, there's really only two seasons here in South Park: Winter, and July, heh heh heh. But, but um, seriously, South Park has always been a place of discovery for me...  Ey, you sons of bitches! Get back here! I'm having a god-damned distinctive honor! If Jakov and Hope don't have kids, their race will become extinct. Hey! I might have been still-born, but at least I got better!  Aren't they cute, you guys?   Hey, Jakov, how's it going?  Moving? You... can't leave. You're my friend.  You brought life to this whole town. It would suck without you. Yes. These people, Jakov, these people need you. ''I'' need you. Please, Jakov. Stay?  Yes. Who would take care of them?  I have authoriteh?  Fine. Hi, Jakov.  Who's laughing? Wow, that's cool. I can help you get ready.  What are we doing out here, you guys? I wanna see if Jakov wins that game show. Oh. Let me get out my notepad so I can classify this new species.  Well, this should be fine, just fine. Just fine, fine.  Why did you bring me all the way out here, you guys? Well, what does that have to do with me being all the way out...? Wait a minute. You're distracting me! That game show is a fix!   Jakov!  Open this door!  No! Jakov, don't go!  Don't, mother! Just, don't. No. That's okay. I'll see you guys.
