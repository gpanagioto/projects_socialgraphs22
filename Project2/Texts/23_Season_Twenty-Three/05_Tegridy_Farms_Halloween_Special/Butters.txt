 One minute, Dad! Archeologist Butters just needs to get his stamp and sticker for his autograph book.  Aha! another rare find! Well wait wait, we can't leave yet! I got all the stickers and tamps except for one! Can I just check around one last time? Well o-kay! Been there... Saw that... Where's that stupid last sticker stamp?  Whoa...  But this is my last one!  Happy Halloween, Mister! M-Mon?  Why thank you. Thank you. I... actually already have a Fitbit, but I could- I could give this one to a friend.  Yes sir? what... happened in town?  Oh, uh, a mummy, huh? That's, that's weird. What?? The mummy talked to you?? There was no argument. I just said I already had it and I'd give it to a friend. I, I just goh- No! I didn't throw the mummy out of the house! The mummy got all pissed off at me and left!  But I didn't do anything wrong! Okay, look officers, I think  I'm under some kind of curse. ...and that's all that happened. I put that stamp in the sticker book, and now this mummy is destroying everything around me. I need help. Wuh-what, what do you mean? Wait. The mummy talked to you, too? Why is it talking to everyone?! No it doesn't! This is crazy! First of all, I don't have fun at school! And secondly... the mummy can do whatever it wants; I don't care! I have to end this curse, fellas. It's getting worse every day. Last night the mummy attacked my parents, and it said I was being narcissistic. It has no reason. No logic! One minute it's destroying everything, and the next it's sending me selfies like nothing ever happened. Look!  This whole thing is so crazy it's starting to make me think I'm crazy!  It's a freaking mummy! Wouldn't you talk about it?! I would love that, but I don't have a choice! I swear, you guys. Mummies can smell fun! Whenever I'm somewhere, and I actually start havin' a good time, I get a call or a text from the mummy sayin' "Hey, what are you doin'?" Like it knows. Yeah. It is fun to get away and just talk to you guys.  What are you in for? I'm in here because *apparently* I'm a passive-aggressive controlling and manipulative psychopath whose narcissitic behavior drives other people crazy. So I said, "Okay, fine. You don't ever do anything wrong! It's all me! You've got no problems, only I have problems! Alright, uh I'll lock my own ass up! Then we'll see who's got issues!" I'll be in here, and something will go horribly wrong tonight, and then the monster will have to accept what it is, and finally work on changing, right?  The mummy! I told you! I'm...  I'm sorry? I'm so sorry. You're right. I can be selfish and narcissistic. Ah I'm gonna work on myself and... and try to make this curse work somehow.
