'''Killer Frost''' is a name used by several female <!--Do not add "fictional" as it is tautological; supervillains (and characters in general) are by definition implied to be fictionalized to some extent.-->[[supervillains]] and [[superheroes]] appearing in [[comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]: '''Crystal Frost''', '''Louise Lincoln''', and '''Caitlin Snow'''. Each different individual in the [[DC Universe]] assuming the Killer Frost persona usually has some connection to the [[superhero]] [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]].

Various iterations (Crystal Frost and Louise Lincoln) have appeared in various animated projects and video games with most of them having the character voiced by [[Jennifer Hale]]. [[Danielle Panabaker]] portrays [[Caitlin Snow (Arrowverse)|Caitlin Snow]] and her Killer Frost persona on the shared DC ''[[Arrowverse]]'' shows, where she is a main character on the television series ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]''.

== Fictional character biographies ==

=== Crystal Frost ===
'''Crystal Frost''' was the first incarnation, first appearing in ''Firestorm'' #3 (June 1978).<ref name=Guide>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=168}}</ref> While Frost was studying to be a [[scientist]] in [[Hudson University (comics)|Hudson University]], she fell in love with her teacher [[Martin Stein]]. While working on a project in the [[Arctic]], Frost was upset to learn that Stein did not reciprocate her feelings; Stein told a fellow researcher that Frost was a withdrawn student and that Stein had merely tried to draw her out of her shell, which Crystal completely misinterpreted. Frost accidentally locked herself in a thermafrost chamber but survived, being transformed in a way in which she was able to absorb heat from a living being and project cold and ice. Calling herself "Killer Frost", she began her murderous crusade against men and clashed with [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]] on many occasions.<ref name="dc-fire">{{Citation|last = Wallace|first = Dan|contribution = Firestorm|editor-last = Dougall|editor-first = Alastair|title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia|page = 123|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|place = New York|year = 2008|isbn = 978-0-7566-4119-1|oclc = 213309017}}</ref> Killer Frost eventually died after she absorbed too much energy from Firestorm.<ref>''Firestorm'' (vol. 2) #21</ref> She has been identified as one of the deceased villains entombed below the [[Hall of Justice (comics)|Hall of Justice]].<ref>''Blackest Night'' #1</ref> Her body was reanimated as a [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lantern]].<ref>''Blackest Night'' #3</ref>

=== Louise Lincoln ===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Killer Frost (Louise Lincoln).jpg|upright|left|thumb|Louise Lincoln as Killer Frost. Art by Tom Grummett{{FFDC|Killer Frost (Louise Lincoln).jpg|log=2021 February 17}}]] -->
'''Dr. Louise Lincoln''' is the second incarnation; she first appeared in ''Firestorm'' (vol. 2) #21 (March 1984) and used the "Killer Frost" name in ''Firestorm'' (vol. 2) #34 (April 1985).<ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |pages=174–175}}</ref> Lincoln was a colleague and friend to Crystal Frost. After her friend's death, Lincoln decided to repeat the experiment as a last respect to her friend, with Lincoln herself as the second Killer Frost. Just as ruthless as her predecessor, she began her own personal vendetta against Firestorm whom she blamed for her friend's death. She briefly served as a member of the [[Suicide Squad]] and sold her soul to [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]] for more power.

During the ''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'' event, Killer Frost attacked [[Hawaii]], freezing part of the islands before being stopped by [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]] and [[Knockout (DC Comics)|Knockout]].

After a group of mobsters put out a hit on [[Lois Lane]], Killer Frost rescued Lois from [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]], only to then leave the reporter bound and gagged on a set of train tracks, hoping to take the credit and reward for Lane's death. Her plan was foiled by [[Superman]] who rescued Lois before the train could hit.<ref>''Superman'' (vol. 2) #182</ref>

Killer Frost was later freed when the DEO refrigeration truck transporting her crashed. [[Effigy (DC Comics)|Effigy]] happened upon the crash and she discovered the heat from Effigy's pyrokinetic abilities enabled her to kiss Effigy without him freezing over. The two had a brief flirtatious partnership that dissolved when Effigy lost patience with her lecturing on how to defeat [[Ion (comics)|Green Lantern]]. After Green Lantern buried them both under a mountain of snow, Effigy escaped and abandoned her to be apprehended again.<ref>''Green Lantern'' (vol. 3) #127</ref>

In the ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' "Public Enemies" arc, Killer Frost was one of many [[supervillain]]s seeking to earn a $1 billion reward offered by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Lex Luthor]] to sanction Superman and [[Batman]]. She teamed with [[Mr. Freeze|Mister Freeze]], [[Icicle (comics)|Icicle]] (Cameron Mahkent) and [[Captain Cold]] in an attempt to ambush the two heroes in Washington D.C., but all four were defeated. They attacked in a second wave, along with more villains such as [[Giganta]] and [[Gorilla Grodd]], but a similar backup of superheroes battered them all into submission. It was later discovered that this ice-themed team of villains was being mind controlled by Grodd.<ref>''Superman/Batman'' #3</ref>

[[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Dr. Light]] hired Killer Frost and [[Mirror Master]] to attack [[Green Arrow]] and [[Black Lightning]] at a hospital in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], where [[Doctor Light (Kimiyo Hoshi)|Kimiyo Hoshi]] was being held. Green Arrow stopped Killer Frost by firing an arrow filled with [[Greek fire]] into her thigh. Unable to absorb the heat from the arrow, she was defeated.<ref>''Green Arrow'' (vol. 3) #54–55</ref>

Around this time, Lincoln discovered that she had contracted cancer, and tricked [[Jason Rusch]], the new Firestorm, into curing her. With her health and powers restored, Killer Frost went on a rampage, only to be defeated when Jason's abilities reversed the alterations to Lincoln's body, returning her cancer.<ref>''Firestorm'' (vol. 2) #9–10</ref>

Killer Frost returned during the events of ''[[One Year Later]]'', where she had apparently entered into a relationship with Mr. Freeze. Together, the two villains went on a killing spree in [[Manhattan]], hoping to draw Firestorm into an elaborate trap. Once the hero arrived, Killer Frost used a device to send both of them into space, where she sought to absorb the heat energy of the sun. Firestorm narrowly managed to stop her plan, and both Killer Frost and Mister Freeze were taken into custody by Batman. As they were being sent away, Killer Frost angrily revealed to Mister Freeze that she had only been using her lover as a pawn, and had no romantic interest.<ref>''Firestorm'' (vol. 2) #24–25</ref>

Killer Frost was later seen battling Firestorm in the ''Justice League of America Wedding Special'' until Lex Luthor, the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] and [[Cheetah (comics)|Cheetah]] arrived, subdued Firestorm, and invited Killer Frost to join the new [[Injustice League]]. She then appeared in ''[[Salvation Run]]'', where she was sent to the Prison Planet after having been defeated and captured by the Suicide Squad.

In ''DC Universe'' #0, she was seen as a member of [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]]'s Secret Society of Super Villains. She is later seen as one of the villains sent to retrieve the Get Out of Hell Free card from the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]], and ultimately helped deal the killing blow to the crazed supervillain Junior and the troubled vigilante [[Catalina Flores|Tarantula]].<ref>''Secret Six'' (vol. 3) #6–7</ref> A short time after this encounter with the Secret Six, Killer Frost appeared as one of the participants in a metahuman fighting tournament in Tokyo. She was defeated by [[Wonder Woman]] and [[Black Canary]] who had disguised themselves as villains in order to take down the tournament from the inside.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 3) #35</ref>

The "[[DC Rebirth]]" version of Louise Lincoln debuts in the "[[Watchmen]]" sequel "[[Doomsday Clock (comics)|Doomsday Clock]]". While Firestorm considers "The Superman Theory" as a hoax, Killer Frost claims that [[Captain Atom]], [[Firehawk (comics)|Firehawk]], Moonbow, and Typhoon are the government's creations.<ref>''Doomsday Clock'' #5 (May 2018). DC Comics.</ref> Killer Frost later accompanied [[Black Adam]]'s attack on the White House.<ref>''Doomsday Clock'' #11. DC Comics.</ref>

=== Caitlin Snow ===
==== The New 52 ====
[[File:Killer Frost (Caitlin Snow).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Caitlin Snow as Killer Frost. Artwork for the cover of ''Justice League of America: Killer Frost'' #1 (January 2017 DC Comics). Art by Joshua Oyerokun.]]
In September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity; Killer Frost is reintroduced in September 2013, as the "Villains Month" part of the ''[[Forever Evil]]'' – she was featured in the one-shot ''[[Justice League#Justice League of America (vol. 3)|Justice League of America]]'' (vol. 3) #7.2, also titled ''Killer Frost'' #1.<ref>{{cite web|last=Young|first=Bryan|title=Exclusive: Which Villains Are Taking Over the Justice League?|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bryan-young/exclusive-which-villains-_b_3385124.html|publisher=Huffington Post|date=June 5, 2013|access-date=June 5, 2013}}</ref> She can also be seen on the cover of ''[[Forever Evil]]'' #1, which hints at her involvement in that series where she's revealed to be '''Dr. Caitlin Snow''', a scientist sent to [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] Outpost #72 in the [[Arctic]] to work on a thermodynamic engine whose creator had committed suicide. Snow soon discovered the place had been infiltrated by [[H.I.V.E.]] agents. When they tried to kill her inside the engine, Snow frantically ripped off the coolant system, merging her body with ice. Transformed into a heat vampire, she killed the H.I.V.E. agents out of revenge. She then wandered out into the cold until she came across a Norwegian camp and took their heat too. Hijacking a helicopter, she made it back to her hometown [[Pittsburgh]]. She even created a suit that helped her retain heat for longer. She later encountered the superhero Firestorm and discovered that his powers could temporarily heal her mutation. She tried recreating the Firestorm Nuclear Matrix several times, only to fail with each attempt. When Firestorm and the Justice League were declared dead by the Crime Syndicate, she lost hope for a cure to her condition.<ref>''Justice League of America: Killer Frost'' (vol. 3) #7.2 (November 2013)</ref>

Killer Frost later has the scientist Byte track down Martin Stein, the original creator of the Firestorm Matrix, to a secluded cabin while he had gone into hiding during the Crime Syndicate's takeover of Earth. She encountered [[Steve Trevor]] who was sent there on a mission to try to find the Justice League who were imprisoned inside Firestorm. Learning Stein was alive, Snow allied herself with the two men to find them. Soon they were attacked by supervillains [[Multiplex (comics)|Multiplex]], [[Black Bison]], [[Hyena (comics)|Hyena]], [[Tempest (DC Comics)|Tempest]] and [[Plastique (comics)|Plastique]] for betraying the Crime Syndicate. While fighting them off, Frost, Stein, and Trevor teleported to another A.R.G.U.S. base, where they learned that to free the Justice League, they needed [[Wonder Woman]]'s Lasso of Truth. Discovering Cheetah was keeping it as a trophy, they found her and her Menagerie, but were subdued. Doctor Light (Arthur Light) suddenly appeared and blasted everyone except Frost and Trevor unconscious. After defeating him, they managed to deliver the Lasso of Truth to [[Cyborg (DC Comics)|Cyborg]] who successfully used it to free his teammates.<ref>''Forever Evil: A.R.G.U.S.'' #1–6</ref>

==== DC Rebirth ====
{{expand section|date=June 2017}}
In [[DC Rebirth]], Caitlin Snow is taken to Belle Reve Penitentiary, where she is introduced to the Suicide Squad and offered a place on the team by [[Amanda Waller]]. She accepts and joins the team. She helps the Suicide Squad in their fight against the [[Justice League]], but subsequently assists them against [[Maxwell Lord]] when he is possessed by [[Eclipso]], whose attempt to tap into her "darkest desire" only unlocks her desire to make a difference. She then has to save all the Suicide Squad and the Justice League by absorbing the energy out of Superman and using it against Lord. Afterwards, Waller is forced to release Snow into Batman's custody.<ref>''Justice League vs. Suicide Squad'' #6</ref> She then joined the new Justice League of America made up of Batman, the [[Atom (Ryan Choi)|Atom]], [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]], [[Black Canary]], [[Vixen (comics)|Vixen]] and the [[Ray (Ray Terrill)|Ray]].

== Powers and abilities ==
All versions have shown the ability to absorb heat from external sources and transmute it into waves of cold. Using these powers, Killer Frost can create an ice-sheen across her entire body that grants her increased durability, cause intense blizzards that can instantly freeze the target and generate objects composed completely of ice, such as projectiles in the form of ice shards and defensive walls or shields. She can also instantly freeze animate matter through physical contact and is unable to touch a normal person without freezing them. Although she is able to kiss people who can can cool her down and negate her cryo-kinetic abilities like [[Firestorm (character)|Firestorm]]

Her weakness is the need to absorb external heat sources to generate ice: although heat-based weapons such as flamethrowers only make her stronger, she can be imprisoned in cold surroundings such as being locked in a refrigeration truck or buried under a mountain of snow. The Caitlin Snow version of Killer Frost is constantly plagued by a hunger for heat, which can only be sated by absorbing the heat from a living being, a process which inevitably kills the victim. However, in recent stories she seems to have finally gotten it under control by only absorbing a tiny amount of heat from every person she touches, sparing them and leaving them otherwise unharmed. The Caitlin Snow and Louise Lincoln versions of the character have, albeit inconsistently, demonstrated the ability to fly, either by riding Arctic winds or through an unknown manner of self-propulsion.

While the exact limits of her abilities have yet to be established, how much power Frost can channel at once seems to depend on how much heat she has absorbed and stored in her body. For example, when she absorbed all the heat from Superman (whose body is supercharged by yellow solar energy) during a stand-off between the Justice League and the Suicide Squad, she was able to flash-freeze the entire League in a single blast.

It also seems that using up all the heat energy she has stored can put Frost's life in danger. If she does not feed in time, she even risks dying of "starvation".

The Caitlin Snow version also boasts a genius-level intellect, being S.T.A.R. Labs' youngest and brightest scientist prior to her transformation. She could solve complex equations easily, operate heavy energy generating machinery and appeared particularly skilled in the field of physics and research about energy. She once managed to create an ice prism with her powers that converted Superman's heat vision into a bright burst of sunlight to defeat Eclipso.

Several adaptations of the villain have also depicted the Crystal Frost and Louise Lincoln incarnations as having basic skills in melee combat which they use in conjunction with their powers as well as impressive agility, being able to perform maneuvers such as leaps or cartwheels with ease.

She is later adopted by the [[Duela Dent|Joker's Daughter]], who trained her in magic and controlling her powers (while also giving her the chance to kill her father).

{{main|Caitlin Snow (Arrowverse)}}
[[File:Killer Frost (Danielle Panabaker).png|thumbnail|upright|[[Danielle Panabaker]] as Caitlin Snow / Frost in ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]''.]]
[[Danielle Panabaker]] portrays [[Caitlin Snow (Arrowverse)|Dr. Caitlin Snow / Killer Frost]], a series regular on ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', which is set in [[The CW]]'s [[Arrowverse]] family of related shows. Her character also makes occasional guest appearances on ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' (in which she debuted), ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'', and ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]''. This version is a member of the [[Central City (DC Comics)|Central City]]-based [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] team alongside [[Cisco Ramon (Arrowverse)|Cisco Ramon / Vibe]] and [[Harrison Wells]], which supports [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|Barry Allen / Flash]].

In [[The Flash (season 1)|season one]], she struggles with her fiancé [[Ronnie Raymond (Arrowverse)|Ronnie Raymond]]'s apparent death following S.T.A.R. Labs particle accelerator exploding and creating various [[metahuman]]s before later discovering Raymond survived as part of Firestorm. Caitlin and Raymond later marry, but shortly thereafter, he gives his life to help the Flash close a singularity that opened over Central City. During [[The Flash (season 2)|season two]], Caitlin grieves for Raymond, but grows closer to [[Hunter Zolomon (Arrowverse)|Hunter Zolomon]] while he was disguised as [[Jay Garrick (Arrowverse)|Jay Garrick]]. When Zolomon reveals he has a disease that limits the use of his super-speed, Caitlin develops the Velocity serum to save his life. However, she and Team Flash soon discover Zolomon's true identity before he kidnaps her and takes her to [[Earth-2 (Arrowverse)|Earth-2]], where she meets her evil Earth-2 doppelganger, Killer Frost. Following this encounter, Caitlin begins to fear whether she has a capacity for evil as well.

Due to Allen altering the timeline while creating and undoing the "[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]" timeline in [[The Flash (season 3)|season three]], Caitlin has developed cryokinetic abilities and an alternate, villainous personality, both of which she attempts to hide from her friends.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ew.com/tv/2017/03/28/flash-killer-frost-return/|title='The Flash' Bosses on That Surprising Return|author=Natalie Abrams|website=Ew.com|access-date=26 December 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.avclub.com/the-flash-finally-unmasks-savitar-but-is-it-worth-the-1798191285|title=The Flash finally unmasks Savitar, but is it worth the wait?|website=Avclub.com|date=3 May 2017 |access-date=26 December 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/dc/news/the-flash-new-photos-barry-allen-3x21-cause-and-effect/|title=The Flash: Killer Frost Turns Up At STAR Labs In First 'Cause And Effect' Photos|website=Comicbook.com|access-date=26 December 2021}}</ref> She also develops a relationship with [[Doctor Alchemy|Julian Albert]]. Caitlin is advised by her mother, Dr. Carla Tannhauser, to not use her powers or her transformations will become irreversible. However, Catlin's abilities fully manifest when Albert removes her power-suppressing necklace so she can use her healing abilities to save herself, triggering her transformation into Killer Frost. Joining [[Savitar (Arrowverse)|Savitar]] as his enforcer, Killer Frost battles Team Flash. Following a fight with Ramon, she turns against Savitar after being given a cure developed by Albert. She defends her former teammates from Savitar and assists in defeating him before leaving to rediscover herself.

In [[The Flash (season 4)|season four]], Caitlin and Killer Frost develop a "[[Jekyll and Hyde]]"-esque relationship.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ew.com/recap/the-flash-season-4-premiere/|title='The Flash' premiere recap: Team Flash is back, baby!|author=Chancellor Agard|website=Ew.com|access-date=26 December 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.itsjustaboutwrite.com/2018/04/the-flash-4x18-review-lose-yourself.html|title=The Flash 4x18 Review: "Lose Yourself" (Death by Ethics) [Contributor: Deborah MacArthur]|website=Itsjustaboutwrite.com|access-date=26 December 2021}}</ref> The former works in a criminal underworld bar until Ramon convinces her to return to Team Flash. Caitlin also comes to terms with her dual personalities, giving herself the ability to switch between her two personas at will. Furthermore, Killer Frost begins to show a more heroic side and agrees to use her powers to help Team Flash. Later in the season, Caitlin discovers her powers and Killer Frost originated during her childhood and that she suppressed the memories.

In [[The Flash (season 5)|season five]], she discovers further that her father, Thomas Snow, experimented on her and himself in an attempt to cure their [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|ALS]] genes, resulting in them both developing alternate personalities with cryokinetic powers. After he becomes [[Icicle (comics)|Icicle]], Caitlin and Killer Frost work together to save Thomas from his evil persona.

In [[The Flash (season 6)|season six]], Caitlin experiments with giving Frost more time with their shared body and allowing her to live her own life. In [[The Flash (season 7)|season seven]], they become exposed to [[Eva McCulloch|Eva McCulloch / Mirror Monarch]]'s rays, which severs their telepathic connection and causes Frost's cells to replicate to the point where she acquires her own body. As such, Caitlin and Frost decide to live separate lives as twin sisters.

In [[The Flash (season 8)|season eight]] Killer Frost transforms into "'''Hellfrost'''" and passes while defeating [[Deathstorm]]. Having secretly taken a hair sample from Frost, Caitlin plans to restore her with [[Chillblaine]]'s help and the Consciousness Resurrection Chamber. While she succeeds, the chamber regresses her and "Frost"'s body to a younger form (if Danielle's younger sister [[Kay Panabaker]] come out of her retirement to play the new Frost).

Frost would return as a spirit call "'''Deadfrost'''" with the same powers as [[Deadman (comics)|Boston Brand/Deadman]] and return to Caitlin's life in season nine.
