Ye Yeah-ha. Mmmmm.  Come on, babe. How long have we known each other? And I still don't get any action. But I'm still in high school. I told you: I'm a very immature 22-year old. Mmmmm  Beat it, chubby! Mmmmm  Come on, babe. Let's go to the living room.   I can't help it. I see your pretty lips and I want to kiss them.  I cherish you, almost as much as I cherish my guitar. When I make it to the big time, I'm gonna take you shopping, and buy you lots of badass stuff. Mmmmm.  Oh, I invited the guys in the band over, so that we can practice.  Hey, do you want me to make it or not?! Don't stand between me and my dreams, babe!  ''Now that we're together I'm absolutely sure that she's Shelly, Shelly.'' <poem><i>Move into my mom's house with me, Shelly Shelly</i></poem> Ey, shut up, tubby! Yah, dude, that was hot. This guitar rocks, man! It rocks! What do you think, Shelly? O-kay, why don't you sing it for us? Hey man, don't be shy. <poem><i>Don't you know? Isn't...</i></poem> Shut up!  You guys, get out! Don't question my love! My love is as pure as morning snow! Get out, I said!  Yeah! Come on! Give it up! Give it up, babe! Come on, babih! Why the hell not?! You're not putting out for me? Well then, screw you, bitch! I've got plenty of other girlfriends that will! If you're not puttin' out, then I'm movin' on! There's plenty of chicks like you out there!  Screw you, prude bitch! Me and my badass guitar are going home! Hasta! What the hell is this?! Salma Hayek? Whoa, she's hot.  Hello-o? Hello-o, Mrs. Hayek?  No clothes, right. Right here, Miss Hayek! What the?  Dude, somebody tricked me! I'll make you pay for making me come out here, God dammit!  My guitar! NOOOOO! You two ruined my career! I'm gonna get you!  Oh, you ripped my pants off! Oh my God! Oohh my Goodd! 
Hey, that's not the right attitude, Jonesy! The Battle of the Bands is tomorrow night!  Not a big deal! This year's winner gets to open for Phil Collins at Lalapalooblaza, and that's no big deal?! We've just gotta practice more. Hey, am I the leader of this band or not?! Huh, let's do it from the top!  Huh-I don't know, man.  Whoaaa! You a singer, man? Yeah! 1 2 3 4   Wooo!! Yes! I'm a rocker!   Yeah? Oh, yeah. You're opening for us as Lalapalazabla. Oh, thanks a lot. I appreciate that. Gotta run.   Huh? Nuh-nn, the name of the band is Timmy and the Lords of the Underworld.  Uh, thanks man. See ya.  Yeah. All of them chanting "Timmy, Timmy." The name of the band is Timmy AND the Lords of the Underworld, not just Timmy. And the Lords of the Underworld! It's always about you, isn't it?! I'm sick of it! Timmy gets all the applause! Timmy gets all the chicks! Well, you know what?! Forget you, man!  I'm goin' solo!   They booed Phil Collins off the stage. Everyone's chanting for Timmy and the Lords of the Underworld.  I don't expect anything. Timmy, I-gh... Well, I just wanted to say we had some pretty rockin' times, dude, and... maybe I let fame and Phil Collins go to my head...  What do you say, Timmy?
