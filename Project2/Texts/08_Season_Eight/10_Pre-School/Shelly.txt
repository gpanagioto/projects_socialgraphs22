Shut up, turd! I'm watching television! I said shut up, or I will destroy you, tur-r-rd!  Stop crying, turd! Now, who's gonna kill you? Oh, you are such stupid turds. Calm down, turd! No Juvenile Hall turd is going to kill you. That's my job. Yes, but I'm gonna want something in return. Shut up, turd!  You're going to admit to Ms. Claridge what you did! You can't run from your past, turds. Apologize and make amends. Then I'll protect you from this Trent turd.
