I want to know just what makes you think it's okay to go inside the girls bathroom! You are not transgender, Eric! You don't even know what that means! All right, well, if you identify yourself as a girl, you must find yourself attracted to boys. Is that right?! Alright, listen, Eric! Listen, ''Eric''! You must know why we can't have you in the girls bathroom! With the what?! But this isn't a hurt and confused child we're talking about. This is Eric Cartman. Sooo Eric Cartman just has us in some kind of bathroom checkmate? Erica, I believe we have a solution to this little problem. If it is agreeable to you, Erica, we are going to clear out the janitor's closet and remodel it into a private bathroom just for you!  Would that be agreeable to you? I'm sorry Erica, but I spoke with Wendyl this morning and she's not comfortable- You'll just have to share, Eric. Why can't you understand that? I thought you were a chick. Stanley, do you have a reason for not using the boys bathroom? And so it is with great pride that I can announce the student body has elected to get rid of the transgender bathroom, and give any fellow student the right to use the bathroom they feel most comfortable in.  Anyone who has a problem sharing a bathroom with people who might be transgender will have to use the special designated bathroom designed to keep them away from the normal people who don't care.
