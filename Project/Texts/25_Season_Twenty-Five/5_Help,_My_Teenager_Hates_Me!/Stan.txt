Yeah, I got some right here, partner!  Dude, I can't believe we tied! That was epic. And you know what else is cool? We all have teenagers now! Hell yeah, dude! We just gotta keep our teenagers happy and we can play Airsoft all the time! Hello?  Excuse me? Oh, is this my teenager? How's it going, dude? Well, you have to put the noodles in boiling water. You… Do you have a sink? Bruh, what? Hey, man, it's cool! Lemme, uh– lemme slow it down for ya. Dude, that's my friend Kenny, we gotta kill him! Okay, okay, but if we kill Kenny we get a point, right? Come on! It's okay, it's fine. We're sorry. Dude, it's ok, it's just a gay rule. Come on, let's beat these guys!  Dude, Kyle, where are you? We started playing like 20 minutes ago. Hair gel?! What the fuck, dude, we're getting killed out here! Oh, my God, you gotta be shitting me.  Yeah—hello? Whuh—what? I-I didn't call you gay. I was saying the rule was gay. I wasn't talking anything about sexual orientation. You're right, I shouldn't have used that word! Look—I was one of the first people ever to say there was nothing wrong with being gay. I had a dog that was gay! Okay, dude… what… do you want me to do? Okay, but you called me… hello? Hello? What are you doing? Okay, don't hold your hand over a lighter. Jesus fucking Christ. Yeah, that was kinda stupid. I seriously don't know what to do… I've tried being nice, I've tried being harsh… and I get nothing from my teenager. Nothing. I'd love him to threaten to do anything. I'd love him to do. Anything. No, we can't give up on Airsoft—I'm like four hundred dollars into this hobby. Except for the part about being around teenagers. What do you mean? Wow. Alright, guys! We got the tents all set up. So, what do you guys wanna do? 'Kay, yeah, we can do that later, but first maybe, um… let's bond a bit… We… have completely had it up to here with you! Our friend Kyle just wanted to play Airsoft. And now he's quit because of your attitudes. What do you have to say for yourselves? Yeah, bruh. Great, thank you.  I can't… I can't… And we don't want you here! We just wanna fucking play Airsoft without any of you on our team! That sounds totally fine! Us against you, let's fucking go! Fine, and you too when we beat all of you!  Dad? They're not coming out of cover! I don't see them! Yeah! That was so epic! That was so sweet, you guys! I bet the teenagers will never go back to that place again! Yeah, thanks, Dad. Ok, let's go!
