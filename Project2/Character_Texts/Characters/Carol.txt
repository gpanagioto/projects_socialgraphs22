Amen. Does anybody have a can opener? 
I want him out of my house! He ain't worth a shit! He can't even hold a fuckin' job! You lazy-ass motherfucker! I'll do it again! 
 That's the whole point, remember? Their moms ''want'' them to catch it while they're young. Nothin'. Uhco-uh, come on in, I was jus' makin' dinner.  Kenny, your little friends are here! Come play with them! I know you're sick! Now get your buns out here!  Throw your sleeping bags in Kenny's room and then come grab some dinner. Let's say grace. Okay, let's dig in. Stuart, don't even get started! That ain't why, Stuart!  It's because ''you'' are an alcoholic retard and ''he'' had dreams of not eating frozen waffles for dinner every night! What am I supposed to do with frozen waffles, clamhead?! You put 'em in the toaster and you cook 'em! Now Kevin, we ain't got enough for everybody. You have to split that with your brother. Kenny, honey, if you're going to sneeze, sneeze on them. You want some more hot water? Naw, we don't go for that hoity-toity ''rich'' folk stuff. Yehah, well, unfortunately my husband is a washed-up hunk of shit! Oh they wuz best friends; you couldn't separate 'em. Oh they jus' grew apart, I guess. I think Stuart's a little jealous that your husband got out of makin' pizzas and went on to make somethin' of hisself. Oh, ''hell'' no! He's a nugget o' deer turd. Uh-I don't know. 
Kenny  You share that blanket with your brother!    My Kenny used to laugh and play. He was eight years old, just like you, my Kenny was. You've gotta tell me ''what happened to him''!  You have to know something! That's right, I'm a little drunk.  My Kenny used to sing and dance, eh. 
And he won't have Attention Deficit Disorder anymore? 
How much is all this gonna cost? Wow, what a great country. Everybody's poor, like us. Good job, Kenny.  Well, what do you think, Kenny? You'd have to leave your friends and your family behind. Okay, okay! 
Kenny, your dad and I are thinking about having another baby. Wouldn't you like to have another brother or sister?  Stop it! Oh, alright.  Oh, go ahead. We can make love afterwards.  What happened?! Well, Kenny, the doctor confirmed it. I'm pregnant! You're gonna have a little brother or sister. Yup, it's for sure! Don't be out too late, Kenny. We need to start movin' stuff out of your room.  Oh, well that's very sweet of you, Kenny. You made my favorite drink for me. But unfortunately, now that I'm pregnant, I can't drink. What's the matter?  Oh, it's all right.  Come on, Stuart, let's just get you to a bathroom. You can? What is it??  Bad baby, bad!  Kenny, what are you going to plunge? Aaaaaaah!   Kenny, GIVE IT UP!  Are you alright, Stuart? Our little angel, yes. What should we name him? Yes. Kenny's such a great name. My little Kenny, a brand-new Kenny. (''The new Kenny then mumbles'') Fifty-second. 
That's my boy!  
We didn't, either. Make a sweater?  Kenny? Kenny, we're sorry. Where is he? 
No, I'm sorry. I picked the four of hearts.  Daa-ah! 
...and so you see, our son was just playing a joke and the little fat kid put it on the carton. Kenny, don't you think you owe the Thompsons an apology?    Yes, well, aaah-I'll help you find your son. Just stop cryin', Please, for the love of God, stop cryin'! 
His body? Well, why?? Oh all right boys. Come on in.  Here he is, boys. Our dear little Kenny.  Your friends are here to see you, Kenny.  Hurry up, Kenny! You're gonna be late for school!  Hurry up, Kenny! You're gonna be late for school!  You see boys, Kenny is in here.  Wait a minute! This is kitty litter! Oh my God! This is awful!  And disgusting! 
Kenny? Kenny, are you still playin' with that thing?  Kenny, it's been two weeks and you've done nothin' else! Who cares if you almost made it to level sixty?! You're wastin' your life, Kenny! If you died tomorrow, what would you have to show for it?! You're gonna end up wishin' you'd done more with your life, ''just like your dead-beat father''! I wasn't talkin' to you, asshole!!  I'd like to see you try! It's my house too, you no-good loser! Will he ever recover? He's alive. He-ee smiles when I talk to him. I think... He did? When? Look, Kenny, your friends are here to visit you again. What? No doctor! You can't! 
You're hoggin' it all, asshole!   You paid for it with the money I made washing dishes at the Olive Garden!  Oh God he's back! It's that mystery kid again! And we gave our sons allowances and stopped gettin' high every night.   We were? I swear, we haven't been back to their meetings ever since, even though we always still get invited. They used to meet every Friday night. I think they still do.  Did that really just happen? 
It's happenin' again!   
You're both drunk pieces of shit! Both of you sit the fuck down! No! Muh babies! Don't take my babies!  My babies! 
 Lorde. My girls are big fans of your music, Lorde, but the women here aren't comfortable sharing a bathroom with  
No, we can't go eat outside. You shut your mouth or I'll shut- 
What are they doing? But they have to! Karen brought in one of their syringes, for Christ's sake!
