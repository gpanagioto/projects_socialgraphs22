'''Razor Fist''' is the name of three fictional [[supervillain]]s appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The original Razor Fist was killed off in the comic books many years ago. The next two characters to take the title were brothers. The current Razor Fist is the only surviving brother.

Razor Fist appears in the live-action [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] film ''[[Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings]]'', portrayed by [[Florian Munteanu]].

==Fictional character biography==
===William Young===
The first Razor-Fist was an assassin, bodyguard, and enforcer employed by Carlton Velcro, working at Velcro's estate on the coast of the Gulf of Lions, southern France. Velcro surgically replaced this man's hands with steel blades. Razor Fist battled [[Shang-Chi]] and was accidentally shot to death by Carlton Velcro's guards.<ref>''Master of Kung Fu'' #29. Marvel Comics.</ref>

[[Doctor Doom]] later constructed two robot duplicates of Razor Fist, which he pitted against Shang-Chi.<ref>''Master of Kung Fu'' #59–60. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Razor Fist is later seen alive again and joins a group of Shang-Chi's enemies that includes [[Shen Kuei]], [[Shockwave (comics)|Shockwave]], Death-Hand, Shadow Stalker, Tiger-Claw, and others led by [[Midnight Sun (Marvel Comics)|Midnight Sun]] that ambushes the Master of Kung Fu and [[Domino (comics)|Domino]] while the two are on a date in [[Hong Kong]].<ref>''Domino'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> The group is quickly defeated by the two.<ref>''Domino'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===William Scott===
Called Razor-Fist because of his fast punches, this man and his brother took the same title and pretended to be only one person. Each brother lost one hand in a car accident, which were subsequently replaced by long knife-like stabbing weapons by Carlton Velcro. Velcro employed the brothers at his mansion on an island in the Marquesas. The brothers were assigned by Velcro to hunt down Shang-Chi and Pavane. This Razor-Fist was accidentally shot to death by Velcro.<ref name="auto">''Master of Kung Fu'' #105. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Each Razor Fist has no known superhuman powers. However, each Razor Fist's physical strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes & reactions, coordination, balance, and endurance are honed to the peak of human conditioning. The first Razor Fist's hands were both surgically replaced with steel blades which he used as weapons, while the former two Razor Fists initially had only one hand replaced with a steel blade. The last remaining Razor Fist eventually had his other hand replaced by a similar blade as well.

Each Razor Fist is highly skilled in multiple forms of hand to razor fist combat, with extensive training in hand-to-hand combat and martial arts.
