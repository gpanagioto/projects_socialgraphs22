Oh my God, look!  Dude! We should each buy a weapon, and then we'll be like ninjas. Yeah, dude, our parents are gonna be at the stupid fair all day long. They'll never know what we bought.  Those are so sweet. Yeah. We wanna get one of each of these ninja weapons. We, we're brothers, see, and our parents... died in a car accident last year. Goddamn, that's like the twelfth time that's worked.  Kiya! Kiya!  With my tonfa of Takanawa, I become the great and powerful ninja Shadowhachi, born to fight evil and people I don't like. What's your ninja name, Kenny? All right, ninjas! Let's go protect the world! Don't worry, Kyle. Craig's not gonna tell on us. Come, ninjas, let's go.  All right, this is it. Ninja positions!  Hello, Craig! We can't tell you where we got 'em! It's secret ninja stuff. Hyeah, "they're not that cool." These are real authentic weapons from the Far East. Uh, we'd love to hang out guys, but we have important secret work to do.  Dude, we're like the coolest kids in the whole state!  Yeah, Butters. You wouldn't make a very good ninja. Come on, guys.  We have a lot of work to do. Hm, this doesn't seem to be the right way. My ninja sense is telling me we might be heading in the wrong direction. Yeah dude, that's like the fifth power you've come up with! Yeah, that it, Cartman! You don't get to have ''any'' powers! I dunno. Craig, is that you?  Hey kid, that knocks you down. Yeah, huh, I got you! Oh yeah?! Kenny! Use your ninja star!  Oh, dude! It's stuck in his eye!  Sh shhhh. It's okay, Butters. Calm down. It's not that bad, really. Okay okay, calm down, Butters! It'll be okay!  Dude, shut up! What?! Just stay still, Butters. God dammit! We... need a doctor... But we can't go to the hospital. Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait. What about the veterinarian? He's really old and going blind. We might pass him off as our pet. All right, then you take him to the hospital, Kyle. You take him to the hospital and let your mom find out what happened. All right. Now we just gotta sneak him into town.  Oh shit, somebody's coming! Where'd you get those? Uh, not now, Craig, we we have to be going. Guys, we're we're really not playing, okay?  We don't have a choice, Kyle. Just humor them. Hyaaaaah!  Hey, wait, wait, ''wait'', wait!   Oh, nice going, you assholes! You made us lose him! No dude, you gotta help us find him! Butters! Butters! Bad. Nothing, just... playing. Butters! What? Yeah, let's just go return them and get our money back. It's all right, Kyle. We'll go back to the fair and return them. All right, the county fair's still open!  We have come to return the weapons we purchased. What is it, Craig? Come on, Ninjas!  Aw dude, crap. All our parents are there.  Oh, Jesus. What? Just run with it, dude. Yeah. I guess parents don't give a crap about violence if there's sex things to worry about.  We've got some more work to do.
