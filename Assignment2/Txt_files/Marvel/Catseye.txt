==Fictional character biography==
'''Sharon Smith''' was a member of the original [[Hellions (Marvel Comics)|Hellions]] recruited by [[Emma Frost]] to be a competitive team to the [[New Mutants]] and a tool for the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]]. Her character was the antithesis of [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]] who could transform into a wolf. She engaged in several battles with the New Mutants—mostly petty competition—but occasionally got along with the students, sometimes having dances to socialize. Her personality was that of a free spirit. Catseye's youth and comparative lack of sophistication belie a ferocious intelligence. She had a photographic memory and instinctively knew when she was being lied to. Under Frost's tutelage, Smith progressed from total illiteracy to upper grade school reading levels in less than a year.<ref>''The New Mutants'' #31</ref> She still retained several feline qualities while in human form, having been forced to provide for herself since earliest infancy. Notably, she kept her tail in many instances. Upon her first meeting with Wolfsbane, rather than attack out of an animalistic nature, she smelled Rahne and said that as shapechangers the two of them shared a kindred spirit and that they should be friends — this in spite of the obviously played feline/canine feuding roles.<ref>''The New Mutants'' #17</ref>

Emma Frost takes advantage of the New Mutants' emotional turmoil after an incident where a cosmic being called the [[Beyonder]] had actually killed them and then brought them back to life. She persuades the current headmaster of the school, [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]], to send the students to the Massachusetts Academy for psychic counseling. There, she  promptly accepts them into the ranks of her Hellions. Catseye shares a room with Rahne, and the two of them become close friends. The two teams become quite fond of one another but were separated when Magneto realized that his mind had been manipulated by [[Empath (comics)|Empath]] and the decision to release the students had not been fully his.<ref>''The New Mutants'' #38-40</ref>

Catseye and Wolfsbane later meet at a formal dress party sponsored by the Hellfire Club. The two sneak off, leave their dresses behind and romp in their animal forms.<ref>''The New Mutants'' #53</ref>

Later, the two teams clash high above Manhattan. Both had learned about the existence of [[Bird-Brain (Marvel Comics)|Bird-Brain]], and neither team wanted the other to have him. The Hellions lose the encounter. Furthermore, an accident sends Catseye and [[Roulette (Marvel Comics)|Roulette]] plunging to the streets. Roulette's power saves them both, allowing them to land safely in a store canopy.<ref>''The New Mutants'' #56</ref>

The White Queen later causes a confrontation between her team and the [[New Warriors]] over the fate of [[Firestar (Marvel Comics)|Firestar]], a member of the Warriors who used to be a part of the Hellions. The battle, held in the New Warrior's penthouse, comes down to a game of numbers, and Catseye scored one for her team by viciously defeating [[Night Thrasher]], easily tearing through his reinforced armor. Ultimately, the Hellions lost by attrition, though nobody defeated Catseye in turn.<ref>''The New Warriors'' #9-10 (March–April 1991)</ref>

Soon after, Emma threw another party which the Hellions as well as the [[X-Men]] Gold team attended. It was there that [[Trevor Fitzroy]]—a member of the villainous group known as the [[Upstarts (comics)|Upstarts]]—crashed the party with the goal of killing Emma in order to gain points within the group. Some of the Hellions died in the initial firefight. The rest, including Catseye, were killed in order to fuel Fitzroy's [[Teleportation|teleportation portal]].<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #281 (1991)</ref>

===Post Death Illusions===
Catseye makes a [[postmortem]] appearance in the 1997 Annual of ''Generation X''. However, this was just a trick played by the [[demon]] [[D'Spayre]] to agitate Emma Frost.<ref>''Generation X'' Annual (1997)</ref>

Also in the ''[[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]]'' #55-56, the Generation X members become trapped in an illusion by [[Adrienne Frost]] where each of them is a different Hellions member except for [[Jetstream (comics)|Jetstream]]. The afflicted heroes relive the Hellions' last day. Jubilee was Catseye.<ref>''Generation X'' #55-56</ref>

===Necrosha===
Catseye, along with all the other deceased Hellions, is resurrected by Selene and Eli Bard. After breaking into Utopia with the help of Cypher, she and the other Hellions confront Emma Frost and taunt her for not saving them. She is subdued by Cyclops when she goes to attack Emma.<ref>''X-Necrosha'' #1 (October 2009)</ref> Part of her return was also portrayed in two issues of the then-current ''New Mutants'' series.<ref>''New Mutants'' #8-9 (2009)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Catseye's [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] power is [[Ailuranthrope|ailuranthropy]], the ability to become a cat. She can transform into either a [[housecat]] or a human-[[cougar|panther]] hybrid (a [[werecat]]). In her panther form, she has superhuman strength, speed, agility, reflexes, coordination, balance, and endurance in addition to hyper-keen senses, razor-sharp claws and fangs, a [[prehensile tail]], a slight healing factor, and the ability to crawl up walls.

Even in her human form, she retained some catlike physical features such as slitted pupils and a tail.

==Other versions==

===Age of Apocalypse===
Catseye was still alive in the alternate reality called the [[Age of Apocalypse]] and was a Hellion. She and the others were hunted down and apprehended by the X-Men, after being knocked out by an enraged Wolfsbane while attempting to flee the beat-down of her fellow Hellions.<ref>''X-Men: Age of Apocalypse'' #1</ref>

===What If===
In a reality where the original X-Men team disbands after the marriage of [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Jean Grey|Marvel Girl]], Catseye is recruited to fill the ranks of the new X-Men team. However, while investigating the presence of a new mutant, she - as well as the other X-Men and Professor X - is captured by the living island [[Krakoa]] and killed by being drained of her life energy.<ref>''[[What If (comics)|What If]]'' vol. 2 #60</ref>
