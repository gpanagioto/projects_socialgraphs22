I wonder how come Cartman's not in school today? Yeah.  Oh, here he comes. Why? Dude, just ask Chef for help. He ''always'' knows what to do. Mr. Derp? Dude! I ''hate'' Mr. Derp!  Shut up, Cartman! Yeah, but we didn't believe them. Moving ''in''?! But Chef always helps us with our problems. When we have a problem, Chef sings to us and makes it better. This... is insane.  That bitch! He didn't even seem like Chef. He seemed like a empty shell of a man. Yeah, so? Look, we've just gotta get Chef alone. He won't listen to reason with that hooker around. Good idea. They said that Chef works in one of these buildings  Dude! Just take them off! He's a big guy, with a beard. We need you, Chef. Chef, this place isn't you! No way, dude! Chef should be here any minute.  I can't believe it! All right, mister! You better have a good explanation for why you didn't show up to play ball! Well, we've got something to tell you about Veronica, ''Chef!'' Mr. Garrison, can we talk to you? All right. Mr. Garrison, have you ever had a friend who got a new girlfriend, and then stopped being your friend, and it pissed you off? That's it! This is totally what's happening! Thanks, Mr. Garrison. Come on guys! We gotta go tell Chef he's in love with a succubus. Oh, hi. Is Chef here? We have to talk to him. There he is!  We ''have'' to talk to him! What's tree-fitty? Yeah! You're a blood-thirsty succubus! Well, you are taking Chef from us.   This is not a woman! It is a succubus!  Oh, you can pretend all you want! You're not fooling anybody! I guess there's nothing we can do. Chef likes her more than us. Here! Here! Look at this. It says "The succubus enchants its victim with an eerie melody. This is the Succubi power. Only playing this melody backwards can vanquish the succubus power." I don't know. Hey yeah! What's that song she always sings? <poem><i>There's got to be a morning after.</i></poem>  In three hours. Ah man! I can't keep my eyes open.  He's asleep. Wake up fatass!  Bitch. Dirty bitch. Now, Cartman!!  Cartman!! Wake up you fat piece of crap!!  You bastard! It's great to have you back Chef!
