'''Absorbing Man''' ('''Carl''' "'''Crusher'''" '''Creel''') is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He first appeared in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #114, cover dated March 1965, created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and writer/artist [[Jack Kirby]], and has over the years played a part on several Marvel Comics crossovers such as the original ''[[Secret Wars]]'' and ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]''. Though depicted for many years as a [[supervillain]], Creel has also been portrayed as an [[Antihero|anti-hero]], siding with characters such as [[Black Bolt]] and [[Alpha Flight]].<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />

Creel was given the power to take the form of any material that he touched, "absorbing" the property of the material itself.<ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff  |title =[[The Encyclopedia of Super-Villains]]  |publisher =Facts on File  |date =1987  |location =New York  |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |pages=1-2}}</ref> Over the years the power has worked both for and against him. The Absorbing Man was given his powers by the [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]] god [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]] in a plot to defeat Loki's brother [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. During the ''Secret Wars'' storyline Creel became romantically involved with the supervillain [[Titania (Marvel Comics)|Titania]] and the two were linked for decades afterward. During the ''Fear Itself'' storyline, Creel comes into possession of a divine Asgardian hammer, granting him amplified powers and turning him into '''Greithoth: Breaker of Wills'''.

Debuting in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], the Absorbing Man has featured in over four decades of Marvel continuity and other Marvel-endorsed products such as [[:Category:Marvel Comics animation|animated television series]], [[video game]]s, and merchandise such as [[trading card]]s.

The character has appeared in several animated television series and video games as well as a live-action adaptation in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] TV series ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'', portrayed by [[Brian Patrick Wade]].

==Fictional character biography==
Carl "Crusher" Creel was a boxer and jailed criminal who becomes the Absorbing Man when he drinks a liquid which the Asgardian god [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]] laced with a magic potion.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=107}}</ref> Discovering that he could absorb the properties of anything he touched, Creel escapes prison by absorbing metal from the guards' bullets and goes on to battle [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Comtois |first1=Pierre |title=Marvel Comics in the 1960s: An Issue by Issue Field Guide to a Pop Culture Phenomenon |date=2015 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1-60549-016-8 |page=87}}</ref> When he escapes, he takes with him the ball and chain to which he was shackled, and uses the ball and chain as a weapon. Although he is only mortal, Creel's fantastic abilities make him a worthy opponent for Thor, who is later forced to end the battle due to Loki's kidnapping of [[Jane Foster (comics)|Jane Foster]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wells |first1=John |title=American Comic Book Chronicles: 1965-1969 |date=2014 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1605490557 |page=46}}</ref> Creel then breaks into a house and attacks the occupants. Thor comes to the rescue and tricks Creel into changing his atomic structure into pure helium. Thor accomplishes this by using his hammer's powers to transform the ground's molecular makeup. As Creel is acquiring additional mass from direct contact with the Earth when this happens, he ends up drifting harmlessly into the atmosphere.<ref>''Journey into Mystery'' #114–115 (March–April 1965). Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=10}}</ref>

A short time later, Loki retrieves Creel from space using Asgardian technology after he has knocked out an Asgardian warlock and sends Creel back to battle Thor. After Creel is nearly beaten due to Thor's fighting skill, Loki transports him to Asgard and reveals the true source of his "absorbing" powers. After being humbled by Loki, Creel agrees to act as his agent, and he is directed to take over the city. The Absorbing Man defeats the Asgardian legions without too much trouble and eventually confronts Odin himself. Creel absorbs Odin's attacks and then the properties of Asgard itself, hoping to rule the universe, and he towers over Odin as Loki arrives to gloat. Thor is ordered by Odin not to keep attacking. Loki and Creel are then beaten by trickery; once given Odin's Rod of Rulership the two quarrel over it, with the Absorbing Man trying to absorb the rod, and the two find that they cannot let go. Odin then advises them that his power lies not in a mere object, but deep within himself. The pair are then banished into outer space.<ref>''Journey into Mystery'' #121–123 (Oct.–Dec. 1965). Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Absorbing Man eventually returns on a comet and battles the [[Hulk]]. Bruce Banner had been sent to divert the comet, as it was feared it was radioactive, but the Absorbing Man leaped aboard and began absorbing the Hulk's strength. He tries to bury the Hulk under a mountain, but when the Hulk turns back to human form, the Absorbing Man is unable to support the great weight and was buried.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #125.

Marvel Comics.</ref>

Creel is later incarcerated in New York's experimental "Ant-Hill" prison called the Big House, where all prisoners are reduced in size via [[Hank Pym]]'s "Pym Particles". An escape attempt is thwarted by [[She-Hulk]].<ref>''She-Hulk'' #10 (Feb. 2005). Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Absorbing Man escapes prison and allies with the [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]] as an enforcer,<ref>''Marvel Knights: Spider-Man'' #13. Marvel Comics.</ref> but finds himself opposed by Spider-Man and new hero [[Ethan Edwards]] (later revealed to be a disguised Skrull). He is briefly trapped and converted into a new form of cocaine by one of the Owl's operatives when they become frustrated with his unprofessional approach,<ref>''Marvel Knights: Spider-Man'' #16. Marvel Comics.</ref> with the new drug briefly giving those who snort him a degree of his powers, but he eventually manages to reassemble himself in a sewer and goes after the Owl for revenge.<ref>''Marvel Knights: Spider-Man'' #17. Marvel Comics.</ref> Spider-Man manages to defeat Creel by tricking him into running a gauntlet where he absorbs multiple objects thrown at him, culminating in Creel absorbing two different chemicals that cause him to explode.<ref>''Marvel Knights: Spider-Man'' #18. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Absorbing Man later battles and is apparently killed by the hero Sentry during the events of ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]''.<ref name="Civil War 2007">''Civil War: The Return'' #1 (Jan. 2007). Marvel Comics.</ref> However, he later appears at the funeral of the villain [[Stilt-Man]].<ref>''Punisher War Journal'' vol. 2 #4 (April 2007). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Creel and Titania later come into conflict with the heroine She-Hulk and her Skrull partner [[Jazinda]] after they attempt to arrest Creel's cousin [[Rockwell Davis|Rockwell "Hi-Lite" Davis]].<ref>''She-Hulk'' vol. 2 #22–23 (Nov.–Dec. 2007). Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'' storyline, Creel joins a new version of the [[Lethal Legion]] led by the [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]].<ref>''Lethal Legion'' #1–3 (Aug.–Oct. 2009). Marvel Comics.</ref> After a defeat, Creel escapes prison and absorbs a shard of the [[Cosmic Cube]].<ref>''The Mighty Avengers'' #32 (Dec. 2009). Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Absorbing Man suffers a setback when villain [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] uses an enchanted sword—provided by Loki—to remove his absorbing powers completely.<ref>''The Mighty Avengers'' #33 (Jan. 2010). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Creel is also revealed to be the father of the hero [[Stonewall (comics)#Jerry Sledge|Stonewall]].<ref>''Secret Warriors'' #12 (Jan. 2010). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Creel regains his powers and storms [[Avengers Tower]] to recover his ball and chain. He is defeated by Avengers' coordinators [[Maria Hill]], [[Sharon Carter]], and [[Victoria Hand]] after absorbing the latter's cold.<ref>''Age of Heroes'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]" storyline, Creel and Titania encounter two of the divine hammers that contain the essences of the Worthy, generals to Odin's brother and adversary, [[Serpent (comics)|Cul Borson]]. Coming into contact with the hammers, Titania and Creel were transformed into Skirn: Breaker of Men<ref name="FearItself#2">{{Cite comic|writer=Matt Fraction|penciller=Stuart Immonen|inker=Wade von Grawbadger|story=The Worthy|title=Fear Itself|volume=|issue=#2|date=July 2011|publisher=Marvel Comics|page=|panel=}}</ref> and Greithoth: Breaker of Wills,<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=Christos Gage|penciller=[[Tom Raney]]|inker=Scott Hanna and Andrew Hennessy|story=No Unwounded Soldiers|title=[[Avengers Academy]]|volume=|issue=#15|date=Aug. 2011|publisher=Marvel Comics|page=|panel=}}</ref> respectively. They later went on a rampage depicted in a number of ''Fear Itself'' tie-in issues, most prominently ''Avengers Academy'' #15–19 and ''[[Iron Man 2.0]]'' #5–6, as well as that storyline's core miniseries.

During the "[[AXIS (comics)|AXIS]]" storyline, Absorbing Man appears as a member of Magneto's unnamed supervillain group during the fight against [[Red Skull]]'s [[Onslaught (Marvel Comics)|Red Onslaught]] form.<ref>''Avengers & X-Men: AXIS'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> He is briefly converted to heroism when everyone on the island experiences a moral inversion as [[Doctor Doom]] and [[Scarlet Witch]] attempt to bring out the [[Charles Xavier]] in Red Skull, joining the new Astonishing Avengers assembled by Steve Rogers and Spider-Man to oppose the inverted heroes.<ref name="Avengers & X-Men: AXIS #6"/> Absorbing Man later reverts to villainy when the inversion is undone.<ref>''Avengers & X-Men: AXIS'' #9. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When Absorbing Man and Titania were robbing an armored car, the [[Jane Foster (comics)|female Thor]] appeared to thwart their plans. Upon meeting the female Thor, Creel mocked her for being a woman and for having taken Thor's name for herself, which she answered by breaking his jaw. Titania then appeared to confront her but, in respect for what she was doing, she knocked out her husband with his own weapon and surrendered.<ref>''The Mighty Thor'' vol. 4 #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]" storyline of 2015, Absorbing Man is among the villains attending [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]]'s viewing party of the incursion between [[Earth-616]] and [[Earth-1610]].<ref>''Secret Wars'' #1 (2015). Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Avengers: Standoff!]]" storyline, Absorbing Man was an inmate of Pleasant Hill, a gated community established by S.H.I.E.L.D. Using Kobik, S.H.I.E.L.D. transformed Absorbing Man into a man named Harold.<ref>''Avengers Standoff: Assault on Pleasant Hill Alpha'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> During his time as Harold, Absorbing Man ran an ice cream parlor and was in love with Sheriff Eva. When [[Baron Zemo|Helmut Zemo]] and [[Fixer (comics)|Fixer]] restored the memories of the inmates, Absorbing Man joined in on their uprising with [[Whirlwind (comics)|Whirlwind]]. [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]] members [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] and [[Titania (Marvel Comics)|Titania]] arrived at Pleasant Hill to retrieve Absorbing Man. Although he was shaken from having a S.H.I.E.L.D.-induced normal life, Absorbing Man sides with the Illuminati as they work to assemble the other inmates to get revenge on S.H.I.E.L.D.<ref>''Illuminati'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "Opening Salvo" part of the "[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]" storyline, Absorbing Man is recruited by Baron Helmut Zemo to join the Army of Evil.<ref>''Captain America: Steve Rogers'' #16. Marvel Comics.</ref>

At some point, Absorbing Man was imprisoned in a deep space torture prison. He was defeated by [[Black Bolt]] in combat.<ref>''Black Bolt'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Absorbing Man later made an acquaintance with Black Bolt and fellow inmates Blinky, [[Metal Master (comics)|Metal Master]], and Raava.<ref>''Black Bolt'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Upon taking in Black Bolt's sonic scream, Absorbing Man seemingly sacrifices himself to help destroy the torture prison's Jailer, enabling Black Bolt and the other inmates to escape.<ref>''Black Bolt'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref> At the time when Jailer has possessed Blinky's mind in order to kill Black Bolt, Lockjaw took Titania to Parkwood Cemetery where Absorbing Man suddenly emerged from his grave.<ref>''Black Bolt'' #11. Marvel Comics.</ref> Absorbing Man and Titania helped Black Bolt fight a Jailer-possessed Blinky until they managed to drive Jailer out of him.<ref name=":0">''Black Bolt'' #12. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After Absorbing Man was imprisoned for another crime, his lawyer convinced him to join the U.S. Hulk Operations as an alternative to getting incarcerated for life. He gets injected with a Bannerman Gene-Enhancement Package that turned him into a gamma mutate able to absorb gamma radiation, at the cost of turning his skin a bright red color. When Absorbing Man - under the alias of '''Red Dog''' - fought Hulk at Los Diablos Missile Base, an entity, the [[One Below All]] entered his body after he absorbed most of the Hulk's gamma energy. The One Below All taunted Red Dog's astral body before ripping his physical one in half.<ref name=":1">''The Immortal Hulk'' #9. Marvel Comics.</ref> Absorbing Man, still controlled by The One Below All, continues fighting Hulk. Absorbing Man ran off when Jackie McGee, [[Sasquatch (comics)|Walter Langkowski]], and [[Puck (Marvel Comics)|Puck]] showed up. When the One Below All successfully opened the door to the Below Place, the lowest point of Hell, the entirety of New Mexico gets transported there as Absorbing Man weeps.<ref>''The Immortal Hulk'' #10. Marvel Comics.</ref> With the help of Puck, Creel was able to transfer the gamma energy he had absorbed back into Hulk, who used his thunder clap to disperse the One Below All's cloud form and transport New Mexico back to Earth. Creel has since been free of the One Below All's influence, having transferred the gamma radiation back to the Hulk.

==Powers and abilities==
Courtesy of a mystical potion, Crusher Creel has the ability to mimic the matter\strength of anything nearby\anyone he is near.<ref>''Journey into Mystery'' #114 (March 1965). Marvel Comics.</ref> Most commonly, he uses his powers to duplicate the properties of anything that he touches—solids, liquids, gases, or even energy sources. This transformation also extends to the items that Creel was wearing and carrying when Loki's potion took effect (for example, if Creel touches the metal [[titanium]], his body, clothes, and wrecking ball takes on its appearance and properties). He can absorb sufficient mass of a large object (e.g., a building) to attain the same height. While in different altered forms, he still maintains his intellect, capacity for speech, and full physical movement (although his first attempt at absorbing water temporarily cost Creel's sanity when he tried to keep himself from drifting apart in the ocean).<ref name="Avengers #184 July 1979" /> His body was able to reform itself after being broken or damaged,<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' Vol 2 #456-457 (September-October 1997)</ref> especially a severed arm which [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] cuts off during the ''[[Secret Wars]]''.<ref>''Marvel Super-Heroes Secret Wars'' #7 (Nov. 1984). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Creel's overall power increases in direct proportion to the material he duplicates. There seems to be almost no limit to what Creel absorbs, as he have mimicked the properties of bronze;<ref>''Journey into Mystery'' #114 (April 1965).

Creel is also now capable of combining previously absorbed abilities.<ref>''She-Hulk'' vol. 2 #23 (Dec. 2007). Marvel Comics.</ref>
