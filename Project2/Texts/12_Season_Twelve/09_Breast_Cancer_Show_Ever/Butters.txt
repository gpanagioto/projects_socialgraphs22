I don't wanna get killed by boobs. Wendy and Eric are fightin' after school! Hey, everybody!  Wendy and Eric are fightin' after school! Jeez, I can't believe Wendy's gonna fight you after school. Yeah, heh.   Almost time.   Huh.  Eric, wha-what's goin' on? Everyone is startin' to say you got detention on purpose to get out of fightin' Wendy. But some people think you crapped on Teacher's desk, uh, to get out of the fight. That's what I said. I told everyone outside, "Cartman ain't scared of fightin' Wendy! He'd do it if he could!". That way it won't matter if you get detention. Man it's almost time for school to start an' Wendy still isn't here. Hehehe yeah, did you come up with that one on your own?! She chickened out!  She's coming! She's coming! But Wendy's coming to fight you. All right!  Fuck him up, Wendy! Well, yeah.
