This is now secondary rainforest we are entering. Notice the canopy of foliage. <i>[turns and stops the group]</i> The rainforest is very delicate, and we must take steps to protect it. Here! Look! These are squirrel monkeys. <i>[one sits in a tree, resting]</i> Endangered inhabitants of the rainforest. And here is a three-toed sloth. <i>[hangs from a branch with all four legs]</i> <i>[standing next to the snake wrapped around a tree trunk]</i> Oh, yes. Uh this is what we call a coral snake. Notice the red markings. Quite an amazing creature. What's the matter, little boy? Naw, naw. You must remember. This snake is more afraid of us than we are of it. <i>[the snake jumps out of the tree and wraps itself around him, suffocating him]</i> Oh!! <i>[the snake bites him all over the face. Stan looks and drops the foliage so as to hide, and Pablo falls]</i> Agh.
