Hi, sweetie. What's the matter? Oh? ...Gosh. Well, get right on fixing that, sweetie. Wanna watch ''The Price is Right''?   What?! No daughter of mine is going to dress like a whore! We're marching down to that store right now, young lady! Oh my God! Well, this place is-! Oh my God!  Mrs. Faulk, you're buying this stuff for your daughter?! Unpopular?! If she's not a whore?!  But these are our girls!  Oh, uh, sure I can buy a purse. Nope. Wendy, I think they're right. You see, you have to believe in the rights of women. For too long they've had to live a double standard.  Oh yeah. I'm sorry I've been so chauvinistic, Wendy. From now on, you can have whatever you want from this store, I'll help make you the stupidest, most spoiled whore of them all!
