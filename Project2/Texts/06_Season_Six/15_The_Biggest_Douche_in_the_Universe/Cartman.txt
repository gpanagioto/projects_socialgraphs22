That was Kenny laughing, not me. Kenny! Thanks, asshole. Hey Kenny! Shut up, Kenny! You shut up, fatass! Twelve hours?? Jesus Christ! Oh, good.  Oh for the love of Christ.  No, Kenny, it's not funny! Right now? Whoa, whoa, watch it lady. Ahh, Aahhhh!   Hey, ah I feel a lot better. God-damnit that was a long flight! I thought we'd never get out of stinky-ass smelly Scotland!
