 Oh cool, Legos. Thanks, Butters. Oh thanks, dude. Oh cool, is this the new Gersploosh album? Mom, I'm 10 years old now. We don't know what you're talking about! It doesn't sound that way to us! That sounds like shit! I know, Mom. I love you too. It's okay, Mom. I understand. 'Night.  Hey dudes. Yeah, yeah I've listened to it. Um, Kyle, can I talk to you alone for a second? Kyle, I have to admit something to you. You know how I told you over the phone I like the new Gersploosh album? I lied. I don't like it. I don't like it at all, Kyle. No, you don't understand dude. Something's happened. Tween Wave doesn't sound the same to me. It... kind of sounds like shit. No. I mean it sounds like somebody is shitting in my ears. Please, just listen really close.  You don't hear shit? That doesn't sound like shit to you? And so then I put on exactly the same album that I really like a year ago, and it sounded like shit to me. Yeah. I used to love these Pop Rock things, and I tried them the other day and I thought they tasted like shit. I just turned 10. So this is normal? Sounds like shit. Uh that sounds like shit too. Yeah dude, it's just shit. They both look the same.  No. They both look like turds about to be reheated to me. Oh no. Hey guys. He said I have cynicism? Something you can get when you get older but, it's stupid. I'm not cynical. All the doctor wants is a paycheck. I went to him for help and he just stood there spouting a bunch of shit. Agh, that shitty game? Who plays video games to listen to a bunch of characters talk and press the X button? How can people say this game is cool? It doesn't even matter what choices you make. That's such a shitty device to keep people playing.  Aw, dude, this looks like shit. It just looks like shit to me, a bunch of processed, gooey shit. Ugh, bunch of people trying to sell us a bunch of shit. What, oh I don't care, I'm cool with whatever. Yeah it sucks. All my friends are sick with the flu. Do you have anything on the menu that doesn't taste like shit? Why? There's nothing but shit on TV, video games are all shit, and the world's a big turd. The only thing that doesn't seem like total shit to me are my friends, and they're all sick. Just, get me a cheeseburger and tell the chef to go easy on the shit.  I thought you guys were sick!  Dude, you totally lied to me! Where were you guys going?! Why didn't you tell me? I wanna go to the movies. You guys... don't wanna be around me? Please, Kyle, I can change my attitude. I promise. Let me go to the movies with you. I won't say a word. Oh shit. Jesus, how long before they start this Goddamned thing?!  Awww God!  Sorry if I see things for what they are! Ok- okay, okay, I'm sorry. How can you say that looks good?!  Ugh. But it's just crap. Oh come on, people! Oh dude dude wait, I'm sorry. Me?! Did you see that shit?! Hang on guys! Kyle? I haven't changed, the world has. Don't you see it?
