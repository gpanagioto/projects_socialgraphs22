Hey, Dad, do you think maybe we could go to Build-A-Bear today? But they said they were open again, so I-  That I'm never going ever again! I'm never going to Build-A-Bear, am I?!  Wha? Okay. Save me from what?  I sure am, fellas! Whoa! Is it really for reals? Oh! Good job, Stan! Thanks for getting my hopes up, you asshole! Oh boy, is this a dream? The Caballero Grizzly. Wow! Aaaah! God! Daaagh! We gotta surrender, fellas. I'm honestly not having that much fun anyway.
