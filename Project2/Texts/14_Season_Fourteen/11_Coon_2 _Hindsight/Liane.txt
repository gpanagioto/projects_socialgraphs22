Ohh, it's a little late, sweetie. Why don't you boys just keep playing downstairs? Well, all right.  All right, are you little munchkins buckled up for safety?  Eric, what have we talked about with that language?! One more time and I'm not taking you anywhere!  No- Eric, stay in the car, sweetie!  Eric, poopsie? Sweetie, let the nice firemen do their job. Yes, Mysterion?  Eric, I talked to you about beating up your friends, didn't I? Eric, you do not beat up your friends! And I told you I've had it with your language!  Your punishment is that your friends will just play superheroes without you! Go to your room!
