Okay, my turn.  Hi Stan! Well, it's great you could join us for Family Home Evening, Stan! Hey kids! Why don't you grab your instruments and play a song for Stan! Oh boy! Who is the best Mom in the world??  All right, kids, now how about we do some Scripture readings! From the Book of Mormon! All right, you rascals. Gather round.  Joseph Smith lived in a little American town in the early 1800s. And we all know what happened then, don't we? Hey gang, let's wrap some more of them up in plastic wrap and hand them out to the poor! Awww, that's too bad. Well, it was really nice meeting you, Stan.
