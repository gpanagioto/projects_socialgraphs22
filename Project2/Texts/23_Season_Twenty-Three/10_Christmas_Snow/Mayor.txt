, everyone. We hope your and your loved ones enjoy all your favorite holiday traditions.  Nobody's out shopping. The town is dead. Our economy depends on the holidays. There's only one thing we can do. We're going to have to ask an old friend for help... and hope that he somehow forgives us. Mr. Marsh, South Park needs you. Everyone's down in the dumps. Nobody's buying presents or going to holiday events. We think that... a little weed might put everyone in a better mood. We understand, but couldn't you do like a limited-edition run just to get people through the holidays? Yes. South Park needs Tegridy Farms. I'll tell you how.  Because you're Randy Marsh, and there's one thing you have that nobody else does. Tegridy. Thank you, Marsh. May God bless Tegridy Farms. We need to talk, Marsh!  , what exactly is in this Christmas snow? Nonono, what is the white stuff on the marijuana? WHAT??? What is wrong with you?!  We can't have you selling this stuff in town! COCAINE IS ILLEGAL! Jesus Christ, you can't just give people coke without them knowing! We could all go to prison! It- it is?
