  Now, I'm going to pass out these booklets, and we're going to go through each and every sexual harassment law. "...Article 36, Section 19: One panda may not make sexual comments about another panda's appearance. If said panda does make..." Uh-oh. That's right, he can. "The first party of the first panda may sue the second-party panda unless that panda was said panda aforementioned panda." Well, when one little panda asks another little panda to perform oral sex, that ''is'' sexual harassment. I'm afraid the law states that the school must be held responsible. Panda. Who? Oh, all right.   I'm a sa-a-a-a-ad panda. It's because I'm a panda, isn't it? I can't help what I am. Well, yes, but that place is for loser mascots that make no sense. I don't have to sit here and listen to this! How would you like a big panda punch in your puss?! It's okay. I get it. There's no room in the world for pandas. Well, you don't have to worry about me! I'm off to the Island of Misfit Mascots!  Why? Seems all I do now is cause trouble. But, I'm just a panda. What message? ...You know? You little cubs might just be right.  Okay! Hello, everyone. I'm Peetie, the "Don't Sue People" Panda. Listen to me: when you sue somebody, it hurts everyone. You sue for money, but where do you think that money comes from? From the schools, from taxes, from the state. From you.  "Don't Sue People" Panda. Pandas love ice cream.  Hello, cubs. I'm "Don't Sue People" Panda, with an important message for you! Lawsuits damage our society. I know it's tempting to make money, but just remember: that money has to come from somewhere. And usually, it ends up hurting a lot of innocent people. So, until next time, don't let frivolous sexual harassment lawsuits ruin our schools. Good-bye now.
