They're not gonna show that stupid-ass Godzilla movie again, are they? Sick, Kenny. All this for a bunch of stupid movies? Cool! If she holds his hand in that theater it'll be all over. I'm poopies, ma! <poem><i>Gone are the dark clouds that had me-</i></poem> Could it be? Mr. Hankey? Mr. Hankey, is that you? Hello? It was him, dude. I ''told'' you, it was Mr. Hankey! Well, I'm ''sure'' it was him. So how was that movie last night, dude? Maybe they should project the movies on Cartman's ass. Well? There it is again! It's Mr. Hankey! I think he's in some kind of trouble. Where does that grill go? Of course, the sewer! That must be where he is. Come on! Come on! Of ''course'' it smells like ass, retard. It's a sewer! We can't, dude. Not until we find Mr. Hankey. What the hell? In a sewer? Yeah, we're the Goonies, Cartman. Why don't ''you'' pretend like you're the fat kid? Mr. Hankey! I ''told'' you guys he'd be here! What's the matter, Mr. Hankey? Are you sick? And that's why you got a cold? Don't worry, Mr. Hankey. We'll go tell everyone. Come on, guys.  Wait! Stop! Could I have your attention, please? Aaahh! Ladies and gentlemen, my best friend, Mr. Hankey, is getting sick because South Park has become overcrowded with people who eat health food. He's a talking piece of poo that lives in the sewer. But now he's getting sick because his egosystem is all out of whack because of all the extra poo in the sewer. If you don't all leave and go home soon, Mr. Hankey's gonna die. He's one of my best friends in the whole wide world, and I don't want him to die. Huh?? Dude, no one even listened to me. Mr. Hankey! Mr. Hankey?! Mr. Hankey? They didn't believe me. They thought I was pitching a movie.  We only have one option. I've gotta take you to the surface. It's the only way to prove to them that you're real. Well, you're not gonna last down here either, Mr. Hankey. Now, come on! I'm not gonna let you die! Mph. Okay, Mr. Hankey. We're out. How are you doin'? Don't worry. We'll do this quick, okay? Just hang on, Mr. Hankey, just hang on! You guys, we have to hurry! Come on! Everything's gonna be okay! Sir! Sir! I have to show you something. I think it will change the way you feel about your impact here. I want you guys to all meet my friend. You ''can't'' die, Mr. Hankey. You ''can't''. Well-. Huwhat is it, Mr. Hankey? Nooohohohohohoho- What is it, Mr. Hankey? What is it? Yes? Nooo! Nooo!  Noo! ''No!'' Uuf. I'll never forget you. You were my best friend after Stan. Chef, does poo go to heaven?  Mr. Hankey? He's back! He's back!  You've got the best balls in the whole world, Chef. Wait! I brought him! I brought him to show you! Behold! Mr. Hankey! No!  O-hoho he's dead. Mr. Hankey's dead. I don't know. You did it, Mr. Hankey. You got rid of all the film people!
