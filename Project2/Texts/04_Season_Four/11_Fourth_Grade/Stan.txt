Well, here we are, dude, the first day of fourth grade. Dude, we gotta find some third-graders to beat up.  What grade are you going into? Stupid third grader! Denver?  Alright.   Like... ah, how about right at 8:35 we all jump up on our desks and pull down our pants and shout, "KISS MY ASS!!!" all together! ...I think showing her our asses should be quite sufficient, Butters. Okay, so it's decided. When the clock hits 8:35 we all stand up on our desks, pull down our pants and yell, "KISS MY ASS!!!" We got you covered, Timmy. Dude, look at the walls.  Everything is written in some strange, foreign language.  What a bitch! This is it. The end of innocence.  This is the loss of that playful youth all our parents warned us about. Hey, that's it! We gotta go back to third grade!  We travel back in time. It can't be ''that'' bad. People do it on TV all the time. We don't ''want'' to make it back, we want to ''stay'' there. Back in the third grade. Oh! Here she comes. Yeah! Timmy, you have to stop! No?? So if Timmy drops his speed below five miles an hour the chair blow, and if he gets off, the chair blows? My God! Over here, over here! Less than 20 minutes?! Well, who didn't see ''that'' coming? ...nine, eight... Dude! You gotta build us another time machine! W-what did you get in a fight about? Oh, Jesus Christ! You've got to be kidding me! Alright, come on, guys.  Man, I can't believe we have to do this while Timmy's already back in time! God-damnit, this is ridiculous. Dude, can you ''please'' just stop fighting with your friend and build another machine so we can travel back in time to the third grade? I know. Wait a minute! I've ''got'' it.  Dude, if you guys build another time machine, you can travel back in time and ask the creator of Star Trek how many episodes there ''were!'' Oh, son of a bitch!  Thah... That's what Mr. Garrison would've said. Dude. Sh-she's right. Yeah. Third grade sucked! Cartman, why the hell did you try to make us think third grad was so great?! Dude, it looks like he's been all over time! He must have such cool stuff to tell us.
