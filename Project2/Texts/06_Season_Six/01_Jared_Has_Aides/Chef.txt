Hello there, children. Fifty pounds? Why? Well, if you want him to get ''really'' fat as fast as possible, one of you will have to marry him. It definitely worked for every ''woman'' I ever met. Well, I guess we're gonna have to do this the old-fashioned way. Come on back, children.  I'm runnin' out, children.  You're gonna give ''children'' AIDS?! Stand back, children! Jared wants to give you AIDS! Eh so he was saying, children should have help like he had!
