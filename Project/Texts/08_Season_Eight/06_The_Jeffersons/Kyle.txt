Yeah, I think they already moved in. I saw moving vans in their driveway two days ago.  Hey Look! Hey. Do you live here? Dude, he just be loaded! What does he do?  What's wrong with his face? Mr. Jefferson, your son can't get up. Mr. Jefferson? Mr. Jefferson said we can invite all the kids in town to go play over at their house. Dude, what happened to your knee?  Mr. Jefferson! Mr- ! Goddammit. Here, come on. We need to clean that up.  Alright, this is gonna sting for a second. I know, I know. Be cool. So, dude, do you have any brothers or sisters? And where is ''your'' mom? You must have a mom. You mean she doesn't live here, or she's dead, or what? What? So you never met your mom? Yeah. Yeah, that counts. You guys, I feel kinda bad for that kid. Mr. Jefferson just seems like he wants to ''be'' a kid, not have one. They're TV dinners. Don't you wanna take that veil off so you can eat? Dude, look who I found prowling around in my back yard. He was out all alone in the middle of the night. Mr. Jefferson isn't even home. What?! Come on, Blanket.  That poor kid. Hey Blanket. Uh, look, we're goin' over to help my dad chop wood. You... wanna come with?  Jesus Christ, dude! Dude, we have got to get that kid away from him! All right. Thanks a lot for helping us, dude.  Shh, Blanket, we're gonna take you away for a little while, okay?  Come on, Blanket! We gotta go before your dad sees us. You bastard!  Come on!  Hang on, Blanket!  All right, let's just say all the bad things said about Mr. Jefferson are lies! Let's say the police department does just go around spending their time framing people for crimes they didn't commit! Let's say it's all made up, and Mr. Jefferson is just a nice guy who's trying to be a child because he never got to have a childhood. Well that's fine, except for that he HAS children now! And when people have children, they have to grow up! All right! Things just might work out!
