Who hath summoned me to this realm?! What do you wish of me, Al Gore?! There is only one place you can find the answers you seek! It is the place where all knowledge becomes known. Your local library. Yes it is. Very well, Al Gore. Let us go! Yeah, guys! Guys, over here! I think I found it. What you're dealing with is a Sifter of Fate. So there's these demons that, um, actually come once every few generations. They're all about making deals. Yeah, check it out: "The Sifter of Fate thrives on tempting mankind. It will always offer a deal in exchange for mercy, but the carnage will be a thousand times worse when the debt comes due." Now it's here to claim its part of the bargain. It's sort of like when you're part of a gang feuding with a rival gang, you know? You ride around on your horse thinking it won't all catch up with you, but... it always does. So good, right?
