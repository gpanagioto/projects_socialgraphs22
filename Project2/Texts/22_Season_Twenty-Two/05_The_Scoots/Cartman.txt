Yeah, I think they just work with your cell phone. Kewl! Do you wanna use your mom's or my mom's? 3715 ... 523 ... Yeah, you want a visa? 8292 438 7766507 45261  How is it, dude? What? Hey yeah! We could cover so much more ground! Oh yeah, Kenny doesn't have a phone 'cause he's poor. Great, cool. You got your pail. Come on in, Kenny. Let's talk.  Okay Kenny, here's the deal. Um, you know that we have this awesome plan to trick-or-treat on e-scooters this year. YOU... don't have a phone. It's probably best you trick or treat with someone else this year. Look, Kenny, I always told you that one day, being poor was gonna catch up with you. Okay? But you didn't wanna listen. You just kept on being poor, and now it's Halloween and you don't have a cell phone. He needs to hear this, Kyle. You know, people are just poor, and they think it's not gonna come back to bite them in the ass. Shouldn't have been poor, Kenny. So, uh, you guys think you're gonna get a lot of candy trick or treating this year? Oh, we have a little secret too! Be? I'm gonna be on an e-scooter taking all your candy!  That's what I'm gonna be! Sorry! Okay. Hold on! This is bullcrap!  We have to get more candy than anyone else, even if we die! Keep moving, Kyle! All right, over here. Come on! We've gotta make room for more candy. Come on. Eat as much as you can.  Yes you can, Kyle.
