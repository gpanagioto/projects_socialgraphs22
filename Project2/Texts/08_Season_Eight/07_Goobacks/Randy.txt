We know, Stanley. We've been watching. That's our new housekeeper, Mrs. Gruhd. She's gonna help around the house on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  And she'll do it for ten cents an hour. Oh my God!  Stan Marsh, how dare you use that time-bashing slur?! They're only taking the small menial jobs that nobody else really wants to do. Hey, Stanley, you need to understand something: Those people from the future have had a hard life! Where they come from is dirty and overpopulated and poor! You can't even imagine the kind of depression they come from! So, for us, who have everything sooo good, to judge them, is wrong! Do you understand?! Next time you think about calling them goobacks, you might just wanna stop for a second and think about how crappy the future really is! All right, good. Now, let's all go eat some of Mrs. Gruhd's great future cooking. Stan Marsh! Because you're being grounded, Stanley! Now I don't wanna hear another word out of your intolerant mouth!  Hey, Mr. Nelson. Why? This is my office. What? You can't be serious. Oh my God. They took my jarb!! We're doing the only thing we ''can'' do. If our government is just gonna let anybody into our time who wants to come, then we have to take matters into our own hands.  We're trying to turn everyone gay so that there ''are'' no future humans! Present-day America Number One! All we can do is try, Harrison. Well what are we waiting for? We're going back to the pile.
