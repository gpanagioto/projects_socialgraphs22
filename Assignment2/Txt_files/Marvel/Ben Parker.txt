'''Benjamin Franklin Parker''', usually referred to as '''Uncle Ben''', is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]], usually in association with the [[superhero]] [[Spider-Man]]. He is the husband of [[Aunt May|May Parker]] and the paternal uncle and father figure of Peter Parker. After appearing ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #97 (January [[1962 in comics|1962]]), Uncle Ben made his first full appearance in ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' #15 (August [[1962 in comics|1962]]), and was created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]]. He was modeled after American founding father [[Benjamin Franklin]].

The character has been an essential part of Spider-Man's history. His death at the hands of a [[Burglar (comics)|petty criminal]], whom Spider-Man previously had the chance to apprehend, but chose not to, has been depicted in almost all versions of the hero's [[origin story]], as the main factor that inspired Peter to become Spider-Man. Uncle Ben's quote, "[[With great power comes great responsibility|With great power there must also come great responsibility]]", has become Spider-Man's iconic life motto.

The character has been substantially adapted from the comics into various forms of media, including films, animated series, and video games. He was portrayed by [[Cliff Robertson]] in [[Sam Raimi]]'s [[Spider-Man (2002 film series)|''Spider-Man'' trilogy]] and by [[Martin Sheen]] in the 2012 film [[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|''The Amazing Spider-Man'']].

==Publication history==
Uncle Ben first appeared in ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' #15 and was killed in the same issue. Although his history as a supporting character was very brief, Uncle Ben is an overshadowing figure in Spider-Man's life, often appearing in [[Flashback (literary technique)|flashbacks]].

===Notability of death===
The murder of Uncle Ben is possibly the most notable in comic book history. He is also one of the few [[comic book death]]s that has never been reversed in terms of [[Continuity (fiction)|official continuity]]. He was a member of the "Big Three", alongside [[Jason Todd]] (an associate of [[Batman]]) and [[Bucky Barnes|Bucky]] (an associate of [[Captain America]]) whose notable deaths, along with Ben's, gave rise to the phrase: "No one in comics stays dead except for Bucky, Jason Todd, and Uncle Ben". Later, the revivals of both Bucky and Jason in 2005 led to the amendment, "No one in comics stays dead except Uncle Ben". The violent killing of Uncle Ben, done by [[Burglar (comics)|a common street criminal]], also shares multiple similarities to the death of [[Thomas Wayne|Thomas]] and [[Martha Wayne]], the parents of [[Batman]], which sometimes is included in the saying.<ref>{{cite book |editor-first=Philip |editor-last=Tallon |last1=Sanford |first1=Jonathan J. |last2=Irwin |first2=William |title=Spider-Man and Philosophy: The Web of Inquiry |date=15 May 2012 |publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]] |page=86 |isbn=9780470575604 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oEHbCwcV-NEC&pg=PA86 |chapter=With Great Power Comes Great Culpability}}</ref>

There have been examples of Uncle Ben remaining alive in [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|alternative timelines]], including stories featured in Marvel's ''[[What If (comics)|What If]]'' (one of which he forces Peter to unmask in front of [[J. Jonah Jameson]]), and a storyline of the 1994 ''Spider-Man'' animated series featured a universe where Uncle Ben had never died, and Peter Parker became a successful industrialist, having never really bothered to use his powers responsibly as everything always seemed to work out for him. This fact is used to defeat the rampaging [[Carnage (comics)|Spider-Carnage]] by exposing him to the one person he will trust and listen to: the Uncle Ben of that reality.<ref>{{Cite episode |title="Chapter II: Farewell, Spider-Man"	 |episode-link= |url= |access-date= |series=[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|''Spider-Man'']] |series-link= |first= Bob|last= Richardson|network=[[Fox Kids]] |station= |date=January 31, 1998 |season=5 |series-no= |number=13 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}</ref>

A story-line in the official series ''[[Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man]]'' seemingly suggested that Ben may be alive. This Ben, however, was actually from a [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] where [[Aunt May]] died in a random accident, leaving him to raise Peter. This alternate Ben came to the planet Earth of regular ''Marvel'' comics (the [[Earth-616|616 reality]]) as part of an evil plan devised by the [[Hobgoblin (comics)#Hobgoblin 2211|Hobgoblin of 2211]] to defeat the Spider-Men of different eras.<ref>''Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man'' #7-10. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the ''[[Clone Conspiracy]]'' storyline, when Peter's clone [[Ben Reilly]] (who had taken Uncle Ben's first name, along with Aunt May's last, to differentiate himself from Peter) used the [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]]'s technology to revive several of Peter's old enemies and allies, he offered to bring Uncle Ben back to life while trying to win Peter to his point of view.<ref name="The Clone Conspiracy">{{Cite comic |writer=[[Dan Slott]] |penciller=[[Jim Cheung]] |title=The Clone Conspiracy |issue= #3 |date=7 December 2016 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] |id=61715 |url=http://marvel.com/comics/issue/61715/the_clone_conspiracy_2016_3}}</ref> Although tempted at the offer, Peter concluded that the reason Reilly had not brought Uncle Ben back on his own was that he knew that Uncle Ben would disapprove of Reilly's actions, as his plan would see everyone on Earth granted immortality, while dependent on him to supply the medication needed to stabilize their cloned bodies.<ref name="marvel.com">{{Cite comic |writer=[[Dan Slott]] |penciller=[[Jim Cheung]] |title=The Clone Conspiracy |issue= #4 |date=18 January 2017 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] |id=61716 |url=http://marvel.com/comics/issue/61716/the_clone_conspiracy_2016_4}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
===Early life===
Ben Parker was born in [[Brooklyn, New York]]. He trained to be a [[military police]] officer,<ref>{{Cite comic |title=The Amazing Spider-Man |issue= #519 |date=20 April 2005 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] |id=1868 |url=http://marvel.com/comics/issue/1868/amazing_spider-man_1999_519}}</ref> and also spent time as a singer in a band. He had known his future wife, [[Aunt May|May Reilly]] since their high school days, but she, in turn, was naively interested in a boy who was involved in criminal activities. When he came to her one night and proposed to her on the spot, Ben was there to expose him as a murderer, and to comfort the heart-broken May when the boy was arrested. Their relationship evolved into love, and they enjoyed a happily married life together.<ref>{{cite book|last1 = Manning|first1 = Matthew K.|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = Spider-Man Chronicle Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2012|location= London, United Kingdom|page = 14|isbn = 978-0756692360|quote= While the finished version of this duo wouldn't debut for another few months, their prototypes took center stage in a short story in the ''Strange Tales'' anthology called 'Goodbye to Linda Brown'...This particular May and Ben lived by the sea and were the caretakers of their young wheelchair-bound niece named Linda Brown.}}</ref> When Ben's younger brother [[Richard and Mary Parker|Richard Parker and his wife Mary]] were killed in a plane crash, Ben and May took in their orphaned son Peter and raised him as their own.<ref>{{Cite comic |writer=[[Bob Gale]], [[Mark Waid]], [[Zeb Wells]], [[Marc Guggenheim]] |penciller=[[Colleen Doran]], Mitch Breitweiser, [[Mario Alberti]], [[Marcos Martín (cartoonist)|Marcos Martin]] |copencillers=[[John Romita, Jr.]] |inker=[[Andy Lanning]], [[Klaus Janson]] |story=My Brother's Son |letterer=Chris Eliopolous, Joe Caramagna |title=The Amazing Spider-Man |issue= #600 |date=2 July 2009 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] |id=24407 |url=http://marvel.com/comics/issue/24407/amazing_spider-man_1999_600}}</ref>

===Raising Peter===
Ben was very protective of Peter, going as far as fighting some of the bullies that tormented young Parker. Peter became friends with Charlie Weiderman in high school, a teen even more unpopular than he was. However, Charlie often provoked the trouble with the other teens. One day, he was chased to the Parker home by a group of bullies led by Rich and Ben intervened. Ben told them that if they wanted Charlie, they would have to go through him. Rich tried to, but was surprised by Ben's [[US army|army]] training. As soon as the bullies were gone, he told the boy that he was not welcome at the house or with Peter because of his provoking the bullies and not being able to tell the truth.<ref>{{Cite comic |writer=[[Stan Lee]] |penciller=[[Mike Deodato]] |inker=[[Jose Pimentel]] |title=The Amazing Spider-Man |issue= #516 |date=2 July 2009 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] |id=1511 |url=http://marvel.com/comics/issue/1511/amazing_spider-man_1999_516}}</ref>

===Spider-Man and death===
In high school, a radioactive spider bite gave Peter superhuman powers. Creating the costumed identity of Spider-Man for himself, Peter sought first to exploit his newfound powers as a masked wrestler and then as a television star. Coming from a television appearance, Spider-Man saw a [[Burglar (comics)|burglar]]<ref>{{cite comic |title=Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Spider-Man |date=31 December 2029 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] |issue= #12 |writer=Jeff Christiansen, Eric Engelhard, Al Sjoerdsma, [[Jason Godin]] |url=http://marvel.com/comics/issue/1886/official_handbook_of_the_marvel_universe_2004_12_spider-man/spider-man |id=1886}}</ref> being chased by a security guard. The guard called for Spider-Man to stop the robber, but the nascent Spidey refused on the grounds that catching criminals was not his job. The robber got away.<ref name=AmazingFantasy15>{{cite comic|writer=[[Stan Lee]]|artist=[[Steve Ditko]]|title=[[Amazing Fantasy]]|story=Spider-Man!|issue= #15|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=August 1962}}</ref>

When Peter later returned home, he was informed by a police officer that his beloved Uncle Ben had been killed by a burglar. Outraged, he donned his Spider-Man costume and captured the man only to realize to his horror that it was the same burglar whom he could have effortlessly captured earlier at the studio. As a result, Peter considered himself morally responsible for Ben's death and resolved to fight crime as a superhero — realizing that with great power comes great responsibility — and vowing never to let another innocent person come to harm if he could help it.<ref name=AmazingFantasy15/>

===Legacy===
Ben's death was truly avenged when the burglar returned for the money once more, threatening Aunt May. The burglar died from a heart attack upon beholding his old nemesis Spider-Man once again and learning that Spider-Man and Peter Parker were one and the same person.<ref>{{Cite comic |writer=[[Stan Lee]] |penciller=[[Keith Pollard]], [[Jim Mooney]] |inker=Jim Mooney |colorist=Glynis Oliver |title=The Amazing Spider-Man |issue= #200 |date=10 January 1980 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] |id=6595 |url=http://marvel.com/comics/issue/6595/the_amazing_spider-man_1963_200}}</ref>

In ''Amazing Spider-Man Family'' #7, May relates to Peter her account of meeting Ben for the first time.

Ben briefly appeared in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #500; after Spider-Man played a vital role in preventing the resurrection of [[Dormammu]], an unidentified higher power provided [[Doctor Strange]] with a small box that he felt he had to give to Spider-Man as a reward for his role in events. When Peter opened the box on the roof of his apartment building, it contained a note saying "You have five minutes. Spend them as you will", followed by Ben appearing on the roof. It was revealed that this Ben – whether a ghost or Ben having been temporally relocated from the moment before his death – remembered being out for the walk that resulted in him getting shot but nothing afterwards, although he concluded that the events leading to him being on that roof were not important. In their talk Ben said that the only thing that would disappoint him about Peter is if Peter ever settled for less because he was afraid of reaching for more. This helps Peter to see that he had a good life for all its hardships, recognizing that he has always used what he has, and Ben assures Peter that he is proud of him before he vanishes.<ref>{{Cite comic |writer=[[Stan Lee]] |penciller=[[John Romita, Jr.]] |inker=Scott Hanna |title=The Amazing Spider-Man |issue= #500 |date=10 January 1980 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] |id=277 |url=http://marvel.com/comics/issue/277/amazing_spider-man_1999_500}}</ref>

During the 2008–2009 "[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]" storyline, Uncle Ben makes an appearance in the Underworld when [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] attends the trial of [[Zeus (Marvel Comics)|Zeus]], directing [[Amadeus Cho]] as he attempted to find his parents in the afterlife.<ref>{{cite comic |title=The Incredible Hercules |issue= #130 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] |date=24 June 2009 |writer=[[Fred Van Lente]], [[Greg Pak]] |penciller=[[Ryan Stegman]], Rodney Buchemi |url=http://marvel.com/comics/issue/25429/incredible_hercules_2008_130 |id=25429}}</ref> In the "Amazing Grace" storyline, Ben appears as an apparition to Spider-Man while battling a horde of demons and gargoyles, telling him that his death is not Peter's or anyone's fault. However, one enemy notices him and attacked only to disappear. This left Spider-Man puzzled if he was [[Daydream|imagining Ben or he was really talking to his ghost]].<ref>{{Cite comic |writer=Jose Molina |penciller=[[Simone Bianchi (artist)|Simone Bianchi]], Andrea Broccardo |inker=Simone Bianchi, Andrea Broccardo |title= The Amazing Spider-Man |issue= #1.6 |volume=4 |date=10 January 1980 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] |url=http://marvel.com/comics/issue/277/amazing_spider-man_1999_500}}</ref>

When Ben Reilly adopted the identity of the Jackal and set up an elaborate plan to use Warren's new cloning process to make the world immortal, he attempted to win Peter's allegiance by showing him Ben's coffin and offering to bring Ben back to life.<ref name="The Clone Conspiracy"/> However, although tempted by the idea, Peter realized that Ben never intended to bring 'their' uncle back to life because he would have done it already, coldly informing his clone that Uncle Ben would tell Reilly that he was wrong, as he has the power without the responsibility.<ref name="marvel.com"/> At the conclusion of the crisis, Peter takes a moment beside the coffin containing Ben's corpse, acknowledging that Reilly's actions were wrong but wishing that Uncle Ben was there regardless.<ref>{{cite comic |title=The Clone Conspiracy: Omega |issue= #1 |writer=[[Peter David]], [[Christos Gage]], [[Dan Slott]] |penciller=[[Stuart Immonen]], [[Cory Smith]], [[Mark Bagley]] |date=1 March 2017 |url=http://marvel.com/comics/issue/62649/the_clone_conspiracy_omega_2017_1 |id=62649 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>

When Spider-Man finally confronts [[Harry Osborn#Kindred|Kindred]] during the "[[Last Remains]]" arc, he finds that Kindred had dug up the bodies of Uncle Ben, [[Gwen Stacy]], [[George Stacy]], [[Ned Leeds]], J. Jonah Jameson Sr., [[Jean DeWolff]], and Marla Jameson and sat them around a dinner table.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #51. Marvel Comics.</ref>

[[The Six Arms Saga|Six-Armed Spider-Man]] creates a cure for Peter, allowing him to live a normal life with Ben and May.<ref>''Spider-Verse Team-Up'' #1 (2014)</ref>
* {{anchor|Earth-3145}}The Earth-3145 version of Ben Parker was isolated in [[Ezekiel (comics)|Ezekiel]]'s bunker after Earth is decimated by nuclear fallout.

However, Ben retired out of grief after his foe the [[Norman Osborn|Emerald Elf]] discovered his identity and killed his May and Peter. After entering Ezekiel's bunker upon being told of the Inheritors, his Earth was decimated when a nuclear blackmail plot by [[Otto Octavius]] went wrong. Although he initially declines to join the other Spiders in their final attack on the Inheritors, Spider-Man and [[Superior Spider-Man]] convince him to do so by arguing that he has only failed if he gives up, Peter in particular affirming that the advice of his own Uncle Ben has saved his world and made a difference every day.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 3 #13 (2015)</ref> He subsequently works with [[Spider-Ham]] to rescue [[Benjy Parker]] – the baby brother of [[Spider-Girl (Mayday Parker)|Spider-Girl]] – and take him to another dimension for safety.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 3 #14</ref> When the crisis is averted, Ben accompanies Spider-Girl back to her home dimension, and decides to remain there so he can be the great-uncle that no other Ben Parker has had the chance to become.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 3 #15</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of Ben Parker differs slightly from the original iteration. Younger than his original counterpart, he is also a former [[hippie]] who wears his hair in a ponytail and teaches [[Spider-Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Peter Parker]] to be nonviolent. Ben also reminisces about the period he lived on a commune. After Peter went out for a walk, Peter learned from a police officer that Ben was murdered.<ref>{{cite comic |writer=[[Brian Michael Bendis]] |penciller=[[Mark Bagley]] |title=Ultimate Spider-Man |issue= #1 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] |date=9 October 2000 |url=https://marvel.com/comics/issue/4372/ultimate_spider-man_2000_1 |id=4372}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic |writer=[[Bill Jemas]], [[Brian Michael Bendis]] |penciller=[[Mark Bagley]] |inker=[[Art Thibert]] |colorist=[[Steve Buccellato]] |letterer=Troy Peteri |editor=Ralph Macchio |editor-link=Ralph Macchio |title=Ultimate Spider-Man |issue= #2 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] |date=10 November 2000 |url=https://marvel.com/comics/issue/14846/ultimate_spider-man_2000_2 |id=14846}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic |writer=[[Bill Jemas]], [[Brian Michael Bendis]] |penciller=[[Mark Bagley]] |inker=[[Art Thibert]] |colorist=[[Marie Javins]], Colorgraphix |letterer=[[Richard Starkings]], Troy Peteri |editor=Joe Quesada |editor-link=Joe Quesada |title=Ultimate Spider-Man |issue= #3 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] |date=10 January 2001 |url=https://marvel.com/comics/issue/14857/ultimate_spider-man_2000_3 |id=14857}}</ref>

===What If?===
Uncle Ben was featured in various issues of ''[[What If (comics)|What If]]''.

* In the first "What If" story regarding Spider-Man (named "classic"), it was Aunt May who went downstairs after hearing a noise, not wanting to wake up Ben. The same storyline plays out, with the burglar shooting May and Spider-Man apprehending him in the warehouse. In this story, Ben finds out about Peter's activities as Spider-Man relatively soon, and talks to him about it. Peter explains to him when he donned the costume and why, even telling him about letting the would-be murderer go that very same night he robbed the wrestling register. Peter breaks down, saying how everything was his fault. Ben responds with anger at himself, being weak in not being able to protect "his May". After Peter tells him he did not know and could not have possibly done anything, Ben instantly calms down and tells Peter to follow his own advice. He further inspires Peter to keep being Spider-Man, not because of regret or penance, but to protect and help all those who are weak and in need of help. Ben and Peter form an even closer relationship with Ben offering his support in many of Spider-Man's future battles. Eventually Ben becomes outraged at Jameson's constant smearing of Spider-Man's name, considering it an insult to May's memory. He eventually lets Jameson in on Spider-Man's identity, forcing Jameson in a position he is uncomfortable in as a journalist. He cannot expose Spider-Man without endangering Ben Parker, yet he also does not wish to support vigilantism. Eventually, he finds a middle road and unofficially employs Spider-Man so he can gain inside scoops on crimes being solved in the city. The story eventually ends with Spider-Man saving Bennett Brant and Betty Brant from Doctor Octopus, as well as fighting a Green Goblin who kidnapped Jameson to find out Spider-Man's real identity (having correctly surmised there was a reason Jameson had those inside scoops). At the end of it all, Peter and Ben shake hands with Jameson saying they will face all dangers and the future together.<ref>{{cite comic |title=What If? |issue= #46 |volume=7 |writer=[[Peter B.

===Derailed Alt-Ben Parker===
In an alternate reality shown in ''[[Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man]]'', an alternate reality was witnessed where May died in a random accident, prompting Peter to go into show business with Ben as his agent to make money. Peter's focus on his career prompts him to eventually leave home, simply paying Ben a percentage out of respect for their old relationship rather than any actual concern. This Ben was eventually 'derailed' into the 616 reality by the Hobgoblin of 2211 as part of her plan against the Spider-Men of various eras, leaving him shocked when he witnessed his destroyed house and the still-living May Parker. Confronting her, he ended up in a fight with [[Edwin Jarvis|Jarvis]], with whom she at the time has a relationship with, but wandered away in confusion. Lacking direction, Ben wandered into an alleyway where he encountered a shadowy figure who offered him a gun, telling Ben that any action he takes would simply create another universe where he took the opposite action, so he might as well do what felt good. After this Hobgoblin was erased from history by a Retcon Bomb of her own invention, the [[Spider-Man 2211|Spider-Man of 2211]] met with what he presumed to be the same Ben Parker to take him back to his own timeline. In a surprise twist, deciding he rather wanted to "stick around for a while", this Ben Parker shoots this future Spider-Man. At the same time, another Ben Parker was shown dead in the alley, meaning one Ben Parker had killed the other and taken his place.<ref>{{cite comic |title=Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man |issue= #10 |volume=1 |writer=[[Peter David]] |penciller=[[Todd Nauck]] |inker=[[Rob Campanella]] |colorist=[[Lee Loughridge]] |letterer=Cory Petit |date=16 July 2006 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] |url=https://marvel.com/comics/issue/4479/friendly_neighborhood_spider-man_2005_10 |id=4479}}</ref>

It was revealed that the Ben Parker who had died in the alleyway was the Uncle Ben of the alternate reality, while the Ben Parker who killed Spider-Man 2211 was, in fact, the Chameleon of 2211; the Chameleon had attempted to convince Ben to resort to murder, but Spider-Man correctly guessed that there were no circumstances under which Ben would do such a thing.<ref>{{cite comic |title=Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man |issue= #19 |volume=1 |writer=[[Peter David]] |penciller=[[Todd Nauck]] |inker=[[Rob Campanella]] |colorist=[[John Kalisz]] |letterer=Cory Petit |editor=Stephen Wacker |date=4 April 2007 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] |url=https://www.marvel.com/comics/issue/6225/friendly_neighborhood_spider-man_2005_19 |id=6225}}</ref>

{{Main|With great power, there must also come great responsibility}}
Although it didn't originate from the character, the quote "with great power, there must also come great responsibility" (commonly paraphrased as "with great power comes great responsibility" and adapted as such in some media) has been popularized by the ''Spider-Man'' comics, and has become widely recognized as Spider-Man's life motto.

==Franklin Richards's Uncle Ben==
[[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]] of the [[Fantastic Four]] often refers to Benjamin Grimm, the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], as "Uncle Ben" (Grimm is the best friend of Franklin's father [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]]). Franklin Richards and Peter Parker also have the same middle name, Benjamin, as the Thing and Ben Parker are their [[namesake]]s. Spider-Man is aware of this, and told Franklin, "Uncle Bens are always right".<ref>{{cite comic |title=Spider-Man/Human Torch |issue= #5 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] |date=29 June 2005 |writer=[[Dan Slott]], |penciller=[[Ty Templeton]],|inker=Drew Geraci, Greg Adams, |colorist=John Rauch |letterer=Dave Lanphear |url=https://www.marvel.com/comics/issue/1986/spider-manhuman_torch_2005_5}}</ref>

==Son of Spider-Man==
In ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #498–500, Spider-Man falls through time, encountering all of his enemies from the past, and sees himself in the future. The future Peter Parker tells him that he should tell [[Mary Jane Watson]] and their son that he loves them every day. "Our son is called Ben", he says, "but it would pretty much have to be, wouldn't it?" However, because of the way time-travel in the Marvel universe works, this is only a potential future and not necessarily a definite one (this future being even more unlikely after the events of "[[Spider-Man: One More Day|One More Day]]").

==The Other Uncle Ben==
{{Main|Spider-Girl (Mayday Parker)}}
Like her father, [[Spider-Girl (Mayday Parker)|Spider-Girl]] also has an Uncle Ben.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-greatest-spider-women-of-all-time-ranked-1796904543 |title=The Greatest Spider-Women of All Time, Ranked |last=Whitbrook |first=James |date=14 July 2011 |access-date=14 May 2018 |work=[[Gizmodo]] |publisher=[[Gizmodo Media Group]]}}</ref> However, unlike her dad, May never knew her uncle: [[Ben Reilly]], Spider-Man's clone. If Spider-Girl has any children in the future, they too would have an Uncle Ben – May's [[Benjamin Richard Parker|baby brother]]. Ironically in the aftermath of ''Spider-Verse'', the Earth-3145's Ben Parker himself would  stay on her world, and has a chance to be his grandfather, something that the other Ben Parkers were unable to achieve on account of their deaths.
