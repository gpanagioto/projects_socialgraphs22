Oh God, here we go again! 9/11 was not a conspiracy, fatass! Not yet. Will you shut up about 9/11! Because anybody who thinks 9/11 was a conspiracy is a retard! Yes. I'm saying one-fourth of Americans are retards. Let's take a test sample: There's four of us, you're a retard, that's one-fourth. Where did you hear that?  Butters, you don't really believe that, do you? Goddamnit, you see what happens when you spread this stupid crap, fatass? [rolls his eyes] Oh no...  Oh Christ... Me??! Hey Tolkien.  All right, all right, I was not responsible for 9/11!  God-damnit!  Terrible. But, everyone thinks I was responsible for 9/11.  Aaaah! I don't know, dude. It's like everyone's putting pieces together that aren't there. It's not my fault. Really? ......Dude. They are? What? No no no. ...That's retarded. There's a lot of holes in the Theory of Evolution too; it doesn't mean it's wrong.  Code 234 What is it? Anthrax?! Stan, we can't be seen with this nutjob!  Aw, aw, awww! Eh-xcuse me, there's been a misunderstanding. Uh, Mr. President, my name is-  Really?  No. Way.  ...Really??  ...Really?? It just... doesn't seem right. Yeah... but doesn't it seem like we got out of the White House pretty easily? I mean, it seems like it would be pretty hard to escape from the White House with everyone chasing you, and we just kind of... ran out.  Hey!  Dude! What the hell is going on?! Dude, we aren't going to kill you.  Who the fuck are you?! Do you mind telling us what the hell is going on?? You f-figured this thing all out? Why would the government want people to believe they caused 9/11? I knew it! You didn't plan 9/11 and you really didn't shoot that guy! Well why don't you just tell people the truth?! Stan! What the fuck?! You knew this whole time? Why?  What?? So you blamed the government?! So wait, wait: Stan took a dump in the urinal and he contacted the conspiracy Web site? But the conspiracy site was run by the government? So then, who was responsible for 9/11?
