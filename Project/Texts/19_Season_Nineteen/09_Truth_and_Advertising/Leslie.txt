Why would anyone think that I'm on the principal's side? I hate the principal. I think he's a dick. Just that he hated me and called me a blabbermouth. I don't think I'm a blabbermouth. I just like talking to people. What kind of plans? I don't know. What are your plans? Really? That's... different. How so? Why would I want to destroy an entire species? You have the wrong idea about me, Jimmy. The person trying to change things and make things terrible is the new principal. He's trying to make sure that people like you and me aren't allowed to exist. I know that you're trying to help. I know that the newsmen in there are trying to help too.  You have to get me out of here, Jimmy. They're going to kill me. Listen to me carefully and don't look at the glass. I feel something for you I have never felt before. I think it's trust. The men in there are sick with hatred and as soon as they realize I have no information they are going to burn me. I've seen them do it to others. Please, you have to help me, Jimmy. Don't let them hurt me. Please don't abandon me. When the lights go back on just look at me and smile. And that's really it, Jimmy. I want to help all of you however I can.  Jimmy. You're gonna help me? Deal with him.  You're trying to find out what's going on, right? But your friend is standing in your way? I can show you what's going on, Kyle. But you have to trust me.  What's the last four digits of your Sosh?
