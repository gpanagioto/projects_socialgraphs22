Don't worry, Jimmy. We're not laughing with you, we're laughing AT you.  Welcome students and parents to the annual South Park Elementary Talent Show!  Okay, that was the Goth kids with "Talent Shows Are For Fags" Okay, very nice, Clark and Laura. Very nice.  Our next act is Butters, who will be singing a song Okay, thank you Butters, very nice, short and sweet.  And now we have Eric Cartman, who will be doing select readings from the movie, ''Scarface''.  Okay, very nice, Ike, thank you. All right, children, it looks like we have no more contestants, which means, the Talent Show is over!  Now we will tally up the judges' scores and find out which act they hated the least. Okay, let's put our hands together for Jimmy Valmer.
