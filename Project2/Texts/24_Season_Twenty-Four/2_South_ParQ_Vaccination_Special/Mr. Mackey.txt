Will you just come on. You gotta loosen up, Mr. Adler. We can get in. Just comb your hair, you know, look your best. I can get us in.  Oh, uh, hey, uh, we'd like to get in there and get some vaccinations, mkay. Well, no, I'm not on the list. I tried to get on the list. I sat on my computer 30 nights in a row trying to make a vaccination appointment and get on the God damn list. Look, the thing is, we are school faculty, mkay. You gotta let us in. Uh, yes it's uh, Tom, Fireman Tom, mkay. I don't know what you're talking about! I'm a hero of the community.  I'm Fireman Tom! Think my life doesn't matter!? I show you what matters.  Stop doing donuts in the school parking lot! I said you old people need to --  What?!  Guess what, boys? I don't care. I come here and I listen to you kids bitch about your stupid problems everyday and I'm 50 years old!  I could die tomorrow from this Covid shit! It's not that simple. There's only one way you're getting your teacher back, and that's if teachers get their hands on the vaccine.  There's a place in town... Very hard to get into. Very exclusive. Walgreens. I've tried to get in many times... Dressed like a fireman, mkay. Dressed like a little ol' lady, but they got security up the ass.
