South Park Elementary, day, computer lab. Mr. Mackey is guiding the fourth graders through some computer operations by reading from a book.

Mr. Mackey

M'kay, so now the computer will show a command bar, m'kay, and we type in "x = y + 1". M'kay, and then it says we hit Command-Y to bring up the menu screen.

Cartman

Aw man, you've got to be kidding me. [Cartman is playing a WW2 shooter on his computer, with Japanese warcries sounding] Goddamn Japs are everywhere.

Mr. Mackey

M'kay, now right-click on menu item "Equate O" and type in "input y"?

Kyle

Nah, dude. Are you on America's side, Stan? [looks like all the other kids are playing the same game: Call of Duty: World at War]

Stan

No, I'm on the Japanese side.

Cartman

Oh, who just shot me? [Bebe leans back in her chair, looks at Cartman, and gives him the finger]

Mr. Mackey

M'kay, let's see, uh the right-click is the upper-right... [his voice trails off] uhhh, but then what the hell is the...? [closes the book and goes back to normal voice] Okay kids, I'm gonna need to get some clarification on this. Uh, just keep entering the calculations; I'll be right back, m'kay.

Cartman

Oh dude, I wish I had a real flamethrower. It works awesome on Japs.

Butters

[runs into the lab and hides behind the wall] Oh my God, oh my God! [runs up to Stan] Stan! Stan, we have a big problem.

Stan

Dude, what?

Butters

There's vampires in the school!

Stan

What?

Butters

Vampires. I've seen 'em.

Stan

Dude, aw! Who's using the flak jacket cheat?!

Red

Not a cheat if you rank up.

Butters

Ugh. [goes over to Kenny] Kenny, there's a vampire on the loose. Then Katie Gelson was hanging out with him, and now she's a vampire too!

Kyle

Butters, there's no such thing as vampires.

Butters

[goes over to Kyle] But there is. You guys gotta believe me. First there was just a couple, but now it's like they're growing. They have fangs and drink blood and everything.

Cartman

All right Butters, well you go document the vampires' movements so we know what their intentions are.

Butters

Really? Do you think that's best?

Cartman

Yeah, now get out of here.

Butters

All right! [runs to the entrance, then turns around] If I don't make it back, tell my mom what happened to me. [turns back and runs out]

Cartman

Oh-hohhh, you got pwned, Bebe, you Jap bitch!

+++++


The school gym, day. Six kids sit on the bleachers in the otherwise empty building - four boys, two girls. They look somewhat like the Goth kids.

Lead Vampire

Isn't this cool? This time of day nobody's in the gym. We should make this one of our official South Park Vampires Club hangouts.

Spiky Vampire

That's an awesome new coat, Mike. Looks totally badass.

Vampir

Don't call me Mike, my name is Vampir now.

Spiky Vampire

Oh, that's cool.

Midnight Vampire

[wears a coat showing arm bones] I'm gonna change my name to Vladimir.

Vampir

You can't, it's too close to Vampir. [Butters rises up from one end of the bleachers just enough to see the vampire kids]

Butters

[pulls out a tiny tape recorder and starts dictating into it] 12:32 p.m. Vampires meeting in the school gymnasium. Leader appears to be a fifth grader.

Sparkly Vampire

You know that girl Bella in Twilight? I think I'm like her. I'm a psi vampire. Do you like these sparkles I got?

Butters

[into his recorder] Annie Bartlett is a psi vampire.

Vampir

Yeah, I'm more a sanguinarian vampire, in that I rely more on the life force energy, per se.

Spiky Vampire

Heh, yeah, I'm gonna be a hybrid vampire, both psi and sanguinarian.

Butters

That's Ryan Ellis. Looks like they've gotten to him too.

Bloodrayne

Lunchtime's almost over. Should we drink some more blood?

Other Vampires

Yeah! Cool!

Vampir

Yeah, and then I think it's time for us to feed, per se. [opens a bottle of Clamato and pours some into the Bloodrayne's goblet.]

Butters

Oh God I think they're gonna drink blood now. They've got some kind of chalice, and they're- [clock] uhn... [he's run out of tape. It rewinds to the very beginning and plays back]

Tape

[Butters' voice] Toot toododoo! [Butters frantically presses buttons trying to stop the tape] It's the Big Texas Butters show! And now here he is, Big Texas Butters! Why howdy there, partners. I'm Biiig Texas Butters. And this is my horse, Toast. Happy Trails, to youuu! [he turns off the tape record, relieved. Until he looks around and jumps from being startled] AAHHH!

Vampir

Ummm, what are you doing?

Butters

[jumps away and whips out a golden cross] Get back! You stay back! Hwa! Heah! The body of Christ compels you! The body of Christ compels you! [runs away without his tape recorder] Hwaaaahh!

+++++


The school hallway, later. Mike is at his locker

Bloodrayne

That kid was really scared of us.

Vampir

That's true, Bloodrayne. People are going to be frightened of us because they don't understand our ways, per se.

Spiky Vampire

Yeah, we're cool, huh? [the Goth kids happen upon the Vampire kids]

Pete

What the hell are those kids doing?

Henrietta

Why are they all dressing like that all of a sudden?

Pete

Are they trying to be Goth?

Michael

No, they're vamp. They wear plastic fangs and drink freaking Clamato juice.

Henrietta

But they can't dress like that. That's our style.

Midnight Vampire

Hey, Tommy Petros is thinking he might wanna be a Vamp kid too.

Vampir

Tommy Petros? Is he cool?

Bloodrayne

Yeah, he's cool enough.

Vampir

All right. [the Vamps and Goths face each other]

Pete

So, all of a sudden you Justin and Britney wannabes think it's cool to dress like us?

Vampir

We dress the way our souls feel, to express the darkness, per se.

Michael

Aren't you Mike Makowski?

Vampir

That's Vampir Makowski now.

Henrietta

You kids need to all go put your freakin' Banana Republic clothes back on, right now!

Sparkly Vampire

Hey, we're just as dark as you guys, maybe darker!

Pete

Really. Do you guys even smoke?

Vampir

Of course not. Smoking's bad for you.

Other Vamps

Yeah.

Pete

[buries his face in his left hand] Oh my God.

Vampir

You know, you guys are really giving off a negative human energy. We prefer to take our darkness somewhere else, per se.

Pete

All right, Count Fagula, you go do that. [the Vamps leave]

+++++


Butters' house, after school. Butters runs inside in a panic, looks around, then heads for the sofa.

Butters

Mom, Mom, I gotta tell you somethin'! You're not gonna believe it!

Linda

[sewing a scarf] Not now, Butters. Your father wants to have a talk with you in the kitchen. He is not happy.

Butters

Oh no, what'd I do this time?

Linda

You just march on in there.

Butters

[hangs his head and goes in] Oh jeez...

+++++


The kitchen. Butters walks in and looks at Stephen, who's by the sink waiting with his arms crossed. To his left are a glass of milk and a box of Hamburger Helper.

Stephen

You see this, Butters?! It's a glass of milk I poured for myself! And you see this?! [holds up the box] It's Hamburger Helper! Now would you mind telling me what Hamburger Helper is doing in this glass of milk?! [Butters begins to tap his fists together, nervously] Why is Hamburger Helper in a glass of milk, Butters?!

Butters

I have no idea, sir.

Stephen

I'll tell you why! [walks over to the pantry and opens the door] Our pantry is always kept organized alphabetically! But somebody put the Hamburger Helper where the Nestle Quik is supposed to go!

Butters

Uh, I'm sorry, Dad. I-It's just I've been really preoccupied lately. See, there are these kids at school, they were-

Stephen

What keeps a family together, Butters?!

Butters

A well-organized pantry.

Stephen

That's right! [starts throwing food out of the pantry on to the floor] If you keep putting food under the wrong letter, it all goes wrong! [stops] Now you will reorganize this entire pantry, and you will do it right!

Butters

Well, okay, but, Dad, you've gotta listen to me. Kids at school are starting to change. They've been acting-

Stephen

You do it right now or you're going to be grounded! You got that?!

Butters

[hangs his head] Yes, sir. [Stephen walks away. Butters turns to the task at hand and begins putting stuff away] Jeez. Nobody will even listen to me. It's like nobody even cares if there's vampires at the school. I try to help and all I ever do is get hollered at. I bet vampires never get hollered at. Vampires just get to do whatever they want. [stops and thinks]

+++++


South Park Elementary, next day, recess. The Vamp kids are on the merry-go-round gathered around Vampir

Vampir



[reading from a book] ...All mortals share a soft repose,My soul doth dreadful vigils keep, More keen than which hell scarcely knows.



Sparkly Vampire

What is that kid doing?

Butters

[walks towards them with hands outstretched] Oh Jesus, oh God, Butters, what are you doing? [pulls out the crucifix he used on them a few days before and sets it down on the snow, then continues towards them, hands outstretched] I- I'm Butters.

Vampir

So?

Butters

O creatures of the night, I seek audience to engage with thee in unholy darnation and thus do... a-a-and thus do unto your bidding!

Vampir

What?

Butters

Oh, uh... I wanna be a vampire.

Cowlick Vampire

You're not cool enough to be one of us.

Butters

Yeah, I know, but uhhh, I think I would make a really good vampire if you just, well, just give me the opportunity.

Vampir

We'll think about it. Go get us some sodas out of the pop machine in the commons.

Butters

Yes! Yes, anything else?

Midnight Vampire

I want some Cheetos.

Butters

Soda and Cheetos, yes. I'll be right back.

+++++


The Goth Corner at South Park Elementary. The Goth kids are listening to music as a soccer ball rolls to a stop in front of them.

Singer

I'm not part of your society. I don't follow your fads and rules. Doctrines...

Boy 1

[with dark blond hair] Where did it go? Do you see where it went?

Boy 2

[with black hair] Yeah, it's right over there by those vampire kids. [Boy 1 retrieves the ball and walks away]

Pete

[delayed reaction] What? Hey. Hey! We aren't vampire kids, we're freakin' Goths!

Boy 1

Whatever, Dracula, why don't you turn into a bat or something?

Michael

So lame. So... lame...

Henrietta

You guys, I do not wanna be grouped in with douchey, little vampire kids.

Michael

Sooo lame! [two Vamps walk out of the door behind him]

Little Vamp

See? Isn't it cool back here? It's all dark and isolated.

Shades Vamp

This would be a great place for a Vampire meeting.

Henrietta

Get out of our space, you little twerps!

Pete

More preppy straight-A students turning into vampires. What the hell is going on?

+++++


The woods, night. Butters is walking through them with drinks and some food. He reaches a small campfire where five of the six Vamps wait for him. Vampir is missing.

Butters

I have done what you've asked. [sets down the goods] A case of Dr Pepper and Cherry Twizzlers. Who are you gonna give this to? I-I mean, vampires can't eat people food.

Vampir

[walks into view] You have done well. Are you ready to become one of us, per se?

Butters

Yeah, I guess.

Vampir

Are you sure? Because once you're in South Park Vampire Society, you can't ever leave.

Butters

Well I'm sick of bein'- bein' pushed around. M-by my dad, by kids at school.

Vampir

Then it is time for your transformation, per se. Let it begin! [they all walk away, leaving behind the Dr. Pepper and Twizzlers. They walk to South Park Mall] This way. Prepare thyself. [the mall is still open, so they walk over to Hot Topic and enter. The Vamps begin checking out clothes for Butters to wear as a new Vamp. The Midnight Vamp gets some fake teeth with fangs while the Cowlick Vamp gets some necklaces and rings. They outfit Butters with them. The Sparkly Vamp gets some hairspray and she and the Spiky Vamp spray Butters' hair with it. Bloodrayne measures him for collars and bracelets. Finally, all six Vamps step away, and a new Vamp is born]

Butters

Whoa.

Vampir

And now you shall drink vampire blood, and your transformation will be complete, per se! [walks away and pours out a bottle of Clamato juice into a goblet for Butters to drink] With this, thy transformation is done. [Butters takes a sip, then immediately spits it out]

Butters

Oh, that tastes awful! Blagh, blagh. [the Vamps leave Hot Topic]

Vampir

It is finished! Welcome, Butters, to the South Park Society of Vampires. [Butters begins to laugh, then cackle.]

+++++


Butters' home, night. He walks into the living room, and Stephen runs up to him

Stephen

There you are, Butters! Do you know what time it is?! Where have you been?! [Butters just walks by]

Linda

Butters, what have you done to your hair? [Butters heads for the stairs]

Stephen

Hey! Butters, we are talking to you! Explain yourself, mister! [Butters stops]

Butters

I no longer need to explain anything to you, Father!

Linda

What on Earth?

Stephen

That does it! You are grounded for two weeks, you got that?!

Butters

You can't ground me! For I am neither living nor dead! How can thy ground that which is... ungroundable. [smiles knowingly. His parents are perplexed]

Stephen

All right, I don't know what's gotten into you, mister, but you're gonna- [Butters hisses at him] Ah!

Linda

Butters? [Butters hisses at them a few times, and Linda clings to Stephen. Butters goes upstairs]

Butters

I am going to my room now! For I must slumber, per se. [his parents are stunned and just look at each other.]

+++++


Principal's Office, day

Principal Victoria

Now, kids, I understand that you are very into this "vampire" thing, but I don't want to see it get out of hand. You kids need to understand that your new little fad is scary to some.

Pete

...Oh my God. You've got the wrong flippin' people.

Michael

[slowly, for emphasis] We aren't vampires.

Principal Victoria

I know that you aren't really vampires, and I appreciate that you wanna be cool because vampires are the "in" thing right now, but-

Pete

We aren't trying to be popular!

Principal Victoria

 -but just make sure that this new little trend doesn't become a distraction. [the door opens behind the Goths]

Mr. Mackey

[enters with Vampir and two younger Vamps] Here's a couple more, Principal Victoria, hm'kay.

Vampir

Oh, oh no, are we in trouble?

Principal Victoria

I was just telling your friends about what I expect of your-

Michael

[slowly, for emphasis] We aren't friends!

Vampir

Don't worry, Ma'am. As I was just explaining to my new minions, vampires are actually very spiritual and deep beings, per se.

+++++


The waiting room outside the Principal's office. The Goths exit and immediately whip out smokes and lighters

Michael

Allison Mertz is a vampire kid now? This thing isn't going to stop.

Pete

Let's just face it: they bogarted our style! Everyone's gonna think we're trying to be butthole vampires now. We might as well go to the freakin' Gap and just buy normal clothes. [they all look at each other thoughtfully]

+++++


Goth Corner, a day or two later. The Goths are now dressed as normal kids, but their hair is still colored as before.

Pete

Well, at least nobody can refer to us as vampire kids now. [the soccer ball bounces towards the Goth kids again and stops in front of Henrietta]

Boy 1

It went this way?

Boy 3

[with very short hair] Yeah, it's over there by that fat girl, the big-nosed kid, the midget, and the kid with pock marks on his face. [Boy 1 sees the ball, walks over, picks it up, and leaves]

Michael

So we're back to that, are we?

Firkle

Shit.

Pete

[stands up] Let's get out of these freakin' Gap clothes.

+++++


Cartman's room, night. He's asleep with the covers off. All of a sudden, Butters is perched on the inside of Cartman's window doors. The other one is open. Butters hisses.

Butters

Sorry, Eric, but I am a vampire now, and I can no longer survive on human food. And if someone must die so that I can feed, I choose thee. [he jumps down from the window and hops onto Cartman's bed, ready to pounce on his throat. He wiggles his fingers, then relaxes them and grips Cartman's head and back] Hm, wonder which side I'm supposed to do it on, hm. Probably doesn't matter. [rears back and bites into Cartman's neck, making sucking sounds. Cartman wakes up and looks at him]

Cartman

Butters? [Butters continues] Butters?! [Butters backs up and then hops off the bed]

Butters

I can't do it. Ah, I- I can't do it!

Cartman

Dude, gross, you got spit all over my neck! Mom! Butters just gave me a hickey!

Butters

I'm so hungry, but just, just remembering how that blood tasted before ju- blood is all clammy and tomato-y. It makes me wanna... [he vomits on Cartman's floor]

Cartman

Dude! [Liane enters]

Liane

You all right, sweetie?

Butters

[advances and hisses at Liane, then runs out through the window and crashes to the ground outside.] U-huh. [bumps into something] Ow.

Liane

What's going on?

Cartman

Well, Mom, apparently Butters is gay, finds me very attractive, and, confused about his sexual identity, puked up all over my floor!

Liane

Oh dear.

Cartman

Yes.

+++++


Henrietta's room, later. The Goth kids are hanging out there.

Michael

I walked into the cafeteria today. Rebecca Miller and Philip Russ were dressed like vampires drinking Clamato juice with four kids from the football team.

Firkle

Jesus.

Pete

It's like, there's more vampire kids every freakin' day. Why is this happening, I mean... why now?

Michael

Doesn't matter why. Pretty soon, the whole school is going to be an endless hive of conformist happy-go-lucky vampire wannabes.

Henrietta

It seems like that preppy Mike Makowski kid started all this. Maybe he's the way to stopping it.

Pete

Whattaya mean?

Henrietta

I mean, what do you do when you want to change vampires back to normal? You get rid of the head vampire.

+++++


A car night. The Goth kids are in it, with Henrietta at the wheel

Pete

Does your mom know you took her car?

Henrietta

Do I care?

Michael

All right, this is probably good enough.

Pete

Yeah, pull over here. [Henrietta pulls over, and the Goth kids leave the car. Henrietta stops by the trunk and pops it open. Inside is Vampir, all tied up.]

Vampir

[tied up and gagged] (Please, what do you want?! Let me go!)

Michael

What should we do with him?

Pete

Well, if he's a vampire, I guess we should drive a stake through his heart.

Vampir

(No! I'm not really a vampire! I'm not a vam-, I'm not a vampire!)

Michael

[leans in and puts his hand to his left ear] What's that?

Vampir

(I'm not really a vampire.)

Michael

You're not really a vampire? Really? I'm so freaking shocked. [moves off and joins the other Goths]

Pete

If we get the right packaging, we can just FedEx him somewhere far way.

Michael

How about we send him to Transylvania?

Pete

No, he'd probably see it as something to brag about someday to his little vampire buddies.

Henrietta

If we're gonna send him somewhere, it should be the most horrible, most miserable place on Earth.

Goths

[after a few seconds of contemplation] Scottsdale.

+++++


The Stotch house. Butters' parents are upstairs. Linda is pounding on the door trying to get Butters to open it.

Linda

Butters, we just got a call from Mrs. Cartman. Butters? [tries to open the door, but finds it locked] Unbelievable! He's locked the door. [She and Stephen change places and Stephen tries opening the door, but it won't open. He pounds on the door.]

Stephen

Butters, this is your father! Explain why you snuck into another boy's bedroom and gave him a hickey! [Butters is in his bed, his arms crossed over his chest. On the headboard are four lit candles. He's hyperventilating] Butters?! Butters, you will open this door right now!

Butters

What have I done to myself? I should have known I wouldn't have the stomach to be a vampire. I am so hungry.

Stephen

Butters, you have five seconds to unlock this door! [counts up with his fingers] One! Two! [the door is unlocked and opened a little. Stephen pushes the door in and it creaks. Stephen and Linda enter slowly. They see his window is wide open and he's not in bed. There are lit candles everywhere] Uhh, Bu-Butters?

Butters

Hey Dad. [he's crouching on top of his bookcase and startles Stephen]

Stephen

AAAARH! Buh. Bu-Butters, did you get gay with one of your schoolmates tonight?!

Butters

I have to eat! But I can't do it. I'm getting weak.

Stephen

[angrily] All right! Now you listen, and you listen good! Until you stop behaving this way, you are not going to leave this room! Do you understand?!

Butters

Dahhh. [hops down from the bookcase and tries to hop onto his toy box, but he trips and lands on the floor. He gets up, climbs onto the toy box and crouches on the window sill, and hisses at them] I know now what I have to do! [hops down to the ground outside] Myah!

Linda

[walks over to the open window] Stephen, what has happened to our boy?

Stephen

[joins her there] He's become something, Linda. Something that... we cannot ground.

+++++


Village Inn, night. The Goths are inside drinking coffee and moping around

Michael

I just. Don't. Get it. We sent the head vampire kid to Scottsdale, but still more and more kids are dressing up like vampires.

Henrietta

He must not have been what was causing it. It must be something else.

Waitress

Hey you kids gonna order any food or just sit there and drink coffee all night again? [pours them another round]

Henrietta

Leave us alone!

Waitress

Bad enough I always get stuck with you Goth kids, now I got Goth kids in my entire section. [she points to them with her left thumb; there are two booths bursting with Vamps. One has seven Vamps, the other has nine]

Pete

They aren't Goth! They're douchey little vampire kids!

Waitress

Looks the same to me.

Pete

I bet they aren't even drinking coffee.

Waitress

[turns to face the Vamps] No, they said they're too young to drink caffeine, so they're havin' orange juice. [turns left and walks away. Pete drops his head on the table and keeps it there]

Henrietta

Let's go over there and tell them they're not taking Village Inn from us too.

Pete

Forget it! It's over, all right? There's too many of them now. We can't stop them. Let's just face it. Freakin' vampires beat us.

Butters

Maybe not. [hisses. He's on all fours on the ledge behind the booths] Did you say you're trying to get rid of the vampires? [crawls closer to the Goths] I want to help you.

Henrietta

Get away, douchebag.

Butters

Some legends say that if you destroy the vampires' lair, the vampires go back to being human again.

Pete

What are you talking about?

Butters

I can take you... to the place where kids are being transformed into vampires. [the Goths look at each other]

+++++


South Park Mall, sometime later. Butters leads the Goths to the Place of Transformation, Hot Topic.

Pete

Awww, Hot Topic? When did this open?

Butters

Two weeks ago. It used to be a Banaaana Repuuubliiic.

Michael

Of course. Freaking Hot Topic. That explains everything.

Pete

How did we not figure that out? Of course a new Hot Topic must have come to town. Duh!

Henrietta

Well, I think we all know what has to be done.

Michael

Yup.

Pete

Let's get to it. [they turn and head into the store. They get aerosol cans and fan out across the store, start spraying, and light the sprays with their lighters, turning the cans into makeshift flamethrowers]

Singer


Burn down down, burn down Hot Topic.
Don't let it steal your soul away.
Burn down, burn down Hot Topic.
Light the fire. Take control.
Burn down, burn down Hot Topic.
Don't let it take your soul.
Burn down, burn down, burn down Hot Topic.
And take control.
Burn down... Hot Topic.
Burn it down... Hot Topic.




+++++


While the song is playing, the following happens: Michael is the first to torch some clothes. Henrietta follows with the belts and scarves. Pete begins to torch the jewelry

Clerk

Hey, what the hell are you doing?!

Pete

You should probably get out of here. [Firkle torches some clothes. Henrietta torches the fake teeth and products with fangs on them. Michael torches the sign announcing 25% off body jewelry and fashion belts. Outside, Bloodrayne and the Spiky Vamp arrive in shock]

Spiky Vamp

What the hell are they doing??

Butters

They're putting an end to it! [the clerk runs out of the store]

Clerk

AAAAAAAAAAAAH! [the Goths continue torching the store until it's thoroughly engulfed in flames, then they walk out and leave. The Hot Topic sign above the entrance crashes to the floor.]

+++++


The Stotch house, night. Linda is sewing again, Stephen is reading the South Park Gazette.

Butters

[enters the living room happily] Mom, Dad! [closes the front door, runs to the sofa, and stands on the sofa between them.] I changed back!

Stephen

What?

Butters

Goth kids burned down the Hot Topic, and sure enough, soon as they did I tried eatin' a hot dog and it tasted good. My vampire teeth even fell out when I bit into it. I'm human again!

Linda

We have no idea what you're talking about, Butters, but we're glad you're home.

Stephen

That's right son. There's only one thing I care about.

Butters

What's that, Dad?

Stephen

Well, would you mind telling me why there's Rice-A-Roni in my coffee?!

Butters

Uh oh.

Stephen

Butters, you are grounded!

Butters

Aw, dang it![walks up the stairs to his room.]

Stephen

It worked, Linda. Our son is groundable once more. [they hug each other]

+++++


The South Park Elementary School gym, day. The Goth kids address the rest of the school, who are seated on the bleachers

Pete

[at the mic] Fellow students. Over the past week there's been a lot of confusion, and so we have asked for this assembly to clarify the difference between Goth kids and Vampire kids. Let us make it abundantly clear: if you hate life, truly hate the sun, and need to smoke and drink coffee, you are Goth. If, however, you like dressing in black 'cause it's "fun", enjoy putting sparkles on your cheeks and following the occult while avoiding things that are bad for your health, then you are most likely a douchebag vampire wannabe boner. Because anybody who thinks they are actually a vampire is freaking retarded. [everyone begins to applaud the speech. During the applause, Michael steps up to the mic and gives everyone the finger]

Michael

Fuck all of you.

+++++
