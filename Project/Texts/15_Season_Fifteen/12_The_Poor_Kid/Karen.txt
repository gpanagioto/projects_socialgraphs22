 Can I see my mommy? Huh?  I was wondering when you'd appear. You always come when I'm sad. Why did my mommy and daddy go to jail? But I'm all alone now. I'll try, guardian angel. I'll see you at recess, right? He just took me back to my classroom. Then he disappeared like always. What do we do, Kenny?  Kenny?
