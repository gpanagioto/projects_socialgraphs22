South Park Elementary School Gym, day. Stan, without his hat, is seated on a stool, none too pleased, before a backdrop of a meadow. Behind the photographer are the kindergartners and Mr. Adler's class

Photographer

Okay, now lift your chin a little. [no change on Stan's face] Look right here. Right here. [points at the camera lens] Hey, where's my smile? Come on, I bet you got a smile for me. I-I'm startin' to see a smile. [Stan doesn't smile] There it is. [FLASH!] Okay great, next.

Stan

[reaches for his hat and puts it on] I didn't smile. [hops off the stool and walks away. A wider view shows Ms. Choksondik's class in line off to the right. The kids move forward. Butters heads for the stool]

Kyle

I hate picture day at school! It's always some gay-ass photographer with some gay-ass backdrop of New England!

Butters

[in dress shirt and tie, holds out his palms] Ah, hang on a second. My mom said to make sure I look good this time in... the school pictures. [pulls out a comb and some gel, dabs the gel on the comb, and combs his hair back. Four strokes, and he's done]

Photographer

Okay, smile [Butters smiles, a lock of his hair goes up, and he blinks. Then the picture is taken, and Butters opens his eyes] Okay, next? [Butters hops off; Bebe, wearing heavy makeup, approaches and hops onto the stool]

Stan

[joins Kyle at the end of the line] Did you go yet?

Kyle

No. This is taking forever.

Cartman

[rushes up, giddily breathless] You guys! You guys! This is sooo funny!

Kyle

What, Cartman?

Cartman

Dude, check it out: for picture day, Kenny got into his parka backwards, so that his ass shows through his hood. Look! [points]. Kenny, Kenny, over here! [Kenny comes in looking as Cartman described, with his hands on the floor and his feet in the air, laughing uncontrollably. After Kenny stands still, Cartman roars with laughter]

Kyle

It isn't that funny, Cartman.

Cartman

Yes it is! [while this is going on, the other kids get their pictures taken, Tolkien being the last one. He hops off the stool and walks away.]

Ms. Choksondik

Next in line! Come on, let's keep it moving, kids! [Kyle walks up to the stool]

Cartman

...Don't listen to that Jew, Kenny, it's totally funny.

Photographer

[Kyle sits for the camera] Take off your hat, please.

Kyle

But I never take off my hat.

Photographer

Come on now, I bet your parents want a picture of YOU lookin' natural.

Kyle

This is how I look natural.

Ms. Choksondik

Kyle, we're taking pictures without hats today!

Kyle

[angrily] Crap. [takes off his hat to reveal big red bushy hair]

Photographer

Smile! Come on, where's that smile? Is it gonna kill you to smile? I see a smile. [Kyle gives a small grin, and the picture is taken. He goes back to being angry, re-dons his hat and hops off the stool] Next!

Kyle

Gay-ass. [Cartman hops on, takes off his hat and quickly strikes a pose]

Photographer

[takes the picture] Very nice. Okay, last one? [hops off laughing as Kenny approaches]

Cartman

Uh oh. [laughs]

Photographer

Okay, have a seat, young man. [both Cartman and Kenny chuckle as Kenny sets himself down] Well, okay, lookin' great. Now where's that smile? Come on, give me a nice, wide smile. Wider. Perfect! [FLASH!]

Cartman

Huh, how long 'til we get the pictures back?

Photographer

Should be about four days.

Cartman

Four days?? Oh man, I can't wait that long!

+++++


South Park Elementary, four days later, day. Inside, in Ms. Choksondik's class, Cartman is fidgeting rather loudly in his desk

Cartman

Heh, c'mon! C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon! C'mon c'mon! C'mon c'mon c'mon!

Ms. Choksondik

Alright, class, I have your school photos to hand out-

Cartman

[bouncing in his seat] YES! YES!

Ms. Choksondik

Most of them are very nice. But, apparently, one of you thinks it's fun to spoil their school pictures [Kenny looks around], and thinks he's a comedian. That person will be spending the afternoon in the principal's office!

Kenny

(Aww, that's bullshit!)

Ms. Choksondik

School photos aren't for joking around, so you aren't getting your photo back, Butters! [thrusts the photo out for a close-up]

Butters

Um-me?? Huh but I didn't do nothin'.

Ms. Choksondik

For the rest of you, I think your pictures turned out very nicely.

Butters

But, buut, but but what hey! Wait a minute! [the others get their photos and review them]

Cartman

[rushes up and takes Kenny's photos] Let me see! [returns to his seat. Stan and Kyle look at Cartman curiously while Kenny looks on angrily]

Butters

[catches up to Ms. Choksondik as she sits at her chair] Bu-but Teacher, I didn't mean to look stupid in my picture. Honest!

Cartman

[opens Kenny's envelope and looks at the photo, then roars with laughter] Dude, dude! Check it out! This is the sweetest thing I've ever done!

Kenny

(You've ever done?!)

Cartman

[Laughs] Look at how the crap ...is sittin' right in the middle! [laughs some more]

Ms. Choksondik

Eric, calm down. I'm trying to yell at Butters!

Cartman

Okay, hokay, I'm sorry Ms. Chokesonrocks!

Ms. Choksondik

You know very well my name isn't Chokesonrocks, it's Choksondik! Say it right or you can go to the principal's with Butters!

Cartman

I'm sorry Ms. Choksondik.

Butters

I tried to make a good picture. Honest.

Ms. Choksondik

Your mother is waiting for you in the principal's office. [points towards the door]

Butters

My mom? [turns around and walks out] Oh, sweet Jesus!

Cartman

Hoh, Oh my God! More people have to see this picture, you guys. I'm gonna put it on the Internet or... No, wait! Kenny. [Kenny looks over] I just had the greatest idea... ever!

+++++


Dairy Gold Milk Company, day. A receptionist in blue suit sits at her desk. The doors open and Cartman enters

Receptionist

Welcome to South Park Milk Company. Can I help you?

Cartman

Oh, yes, hello. I am helping out a family who has a missing child, and I was wondering if you could print his photo on your milk carton? [stifles a laugh]

Receptionist

Oh, of course. Printing those photos on our milk really does help. Do you have the photo with you?

Cartman

Yes, I have it right hmya. [shows her Kenny's school photo]

Receptionist

[takes the photo] O-okay, great. We'll print it immediately.

Cartman

You will? [tries not to laugh, but some escapes] Ah. [stifles another laugh] Oh, ah, thank you for your help.

Receptionist

Sure. If I could get a description of the child to print underneath the photo? [Cartman stops in his tracks and turns around]

Cartman

Oh, yehes. Uh-heh. He has ah, blond hair, aha-and, ah, and a brown eye. [sniggers, then laughs] Brown eye! [laughs some more under his breath]

Receptionist

Okay, brown eye...

Cartman

And, and big rosy cheeks! [laughs some more]

Receptionist

...Full cheeks...

Cartman

[cracks up] Full cheeks! [laughs] Winking brown eye, brown eye winking! [cracks up]

+++++


Stan's house, day. A TV is heard.

Reporter

Ms. Hamilton was the fourth person to be run over by a motorcycle this week, leaving a city to ponder, who will be next? [Stan and Kyle are on the sofa eating popcorn. The phone rings, and Kyle answers it]

Kyle

Hello?

Cartman

[between the laughter] You guys! You guys! You guys! [laughs uncontrollably]

Kyle

Hello?

Cartman

[more laughter] ...You guys!... [more laughter]

Kyle

[getting annoyed] Cartman?

Cartman

[more laughter] You guys! You guys! You guys! Hurry. [hangs up]

Stan

What's he want?

Kyle

[pissed off] I don't know. Let's go see. [they walk off]

+++++


Cartman's house, minutes later. Cartman can be heard laughing inside as Stan and Kyle approach his door. Kyle rings the doorbell and Cartman answers, still laughing.

Kyle

Why'd you call us?

Cartman

Come on. Come on. [whispers] Come on.[leads the way] Oho, this is so sweet! [still laughing as he walks to the sofa and picks up a milk carton] You guys, seriously, this is sooo sweet!

Stan

Goddamnit Cartman, what?! [Cartman hands him the carton and erupts in laughter as Stan and Kyle look it over]

Kyle

...You put Kenny's picture on a milk carton??

Cartman

Look at, look at the description. Brown eye! [falls to the floor, pounding the carpet with his fists in hysterics]

Stan

That isn't funny, Cartman.

Cartman

Oh, it's soo completely funny!! Ahaha this is certainly funny!!

Kyle

No it's not, Cartman. You know, there really are couples out there who are missing children.

Cartman

No there aren't. Jesus, grow up, you guys.

+++++


A house in Wisconsin. A woman enters her kitchen with some groceries and sets them on the kitchen counter next to the sink. She pulls them out one by one, but stops when she pulls out the milk carton

Martha

[gasps] Oh my God. Oh my God! [holds the carton close. Her face looks like a derriere] Steven! Steven, come quick!

Steven

[rushes in. His face does also.] What is it, Martha?

Martha

Look. It's him! It's... our son.

Steven

Our ssson!

+++++


Dairy Gold Milk Company, day, a few days later. The Wisconsin couple are at the Dairy Gold Milk Company, talking to the receptionist. Their "s" and sometimes "th" comes out sounding like a raspberry

Martha

...and so that's when I called out to my husband. I just knew the boy picture on your milk carton was our little Tommy.

Receptionist

[stunned] ... yes, I see. [pics up a milk carton carton] Uh, but the child on the milk carton was reported missing, not found.

Steven

We realize that. But we just thought that maybe someone else had found Tommy, and then lost him again. We're pretty certain that it's our boy, considering his physical appearance. Martha and I have the... same condition.

Receptionist

...Riiight.

Steven

You may not have realized this, but we actually have buttocks where our heads should be.

Receptionist

[flatly] ...Really?

Steven

Yes.

Martha

Steven and I have a condition called "torsonic polarity syndrome." It's a birth defect that's passed on genetically.

Steven

Over eleven people worldwide suffer from TPS.

Receptionist

[flatly] Hmm, hmm, that's am-, that's amazing.

Steven

Martha and I were lucky enough to meet each other at a TPS convention in France.

Receptionist

So... do you have heads down where your rear ends should be?

Steven

No no, don't be silly. You see, with TPS, the birth defect is on the exterior only. Behind this we still have all our vital head organs - tongue, eyes, nasal passages...

Receptionist

Well, Mr. and Mrs...

Steven

Uh, Thompssson.

Receptionist

...Thompson. Uh, I'll contact the young boy who gave me the photo, and perhaps we can all visit him together.

Martha

Oh, wonderful! Steven, we're goin' to see Tommy again!

Steven

Now, Martha, what did I say about getting our hopesss up?

Martha

You're right. You're right.

+++++


Cartman's house, moments later. Cartman is laughing his ass off on the sofa when Stan and Kyle return to see him.

Kyle

...Okay Cartman, what do you want this time?

Cartman

[gets up and hops off the sofa] Oho, you guys, you guys! Oh my God. [tries to compose himself] Okay, okay, so get this, get this: The milk company calls me, right? [wipes some moisture from his face] And they call me and say that two people from Wisconsin... saw the picture of Kenny on the milk carton, and they think it's their kid. [cracks up again]

Stan

...Dude, that's not funny if they're missing their son.

Cartman

No, nonono! Because apparently these two people... also kind of look like they have butts where their heads should be! [waits a second, then roars with laughter again]

Kyle

...Nuh uh.

Cartman

Oh yes! And the best part is... they're coming here, to my house. And it's gonna be sooo funny!! [roars with laughter again. The doorbell rings and all three look at the door] Oh Jesus, that's probably them now! Okay, you guys, just play it cool, just play it-, just-sshh. No, sshh, you guys, sshh. [walks over to answer the door. He stops and stifle a laugh] Just- okay [chuckles] No. [takes a few steps] Okay, okay, no, you guys, sh, sh. [steps to the door, takes a deep breath, and opens it, grinning]

Martha

[greeting] Hello, we're Mr. and Mrs. Thompson. [Cartman stands there grinning, then it disappears into a frown. A few moments later he turns around dejected.]

Cartman

Oh God.

Kyle

[starts laughing, but stifles it with his hands over his mouth] Hohly crahap, duhude, heh!

Stan

No way! [Cartman turns around and looks again, frowning]

Steven

We understand you've seen our son. [Cartman looks speechless, then turns around looking lost]

Cartman

[very softly] Oh my... God. [walks away from the door quite afraid, then begins to ascend the stairs stammering nonsense]

Stan

Cartman, where are you going?? [Cartman keeps walking. The Thompsons simply shrug their shoulders, looking at each other]

Martha

[holds up the milk carton] Uh, excuse me, boys, do you know anything about this?

Kyle

[giggles a bit] Uh

Stan

Oh boy.

Kyle

Eh-heh. L-look, if you want an explanation, you you'd better go to Kenny's house.

Stan

Yeah. He lives about four houses away in the bad side of town.

Martha

[Steven puts his arm around her shoulder] Oh thank you. Thank you! [they turn and walk away. The receptionist waits for them on the walkway]

Receptionist

Well?

Steven

They said to inquire four houses down.

Martha

Let's hurry! [leads the way down the street. Steven and the receptionist follow]

+++++


Cartman's room, moments later. Cartman is at a loss for words and looks scared. The door opens and Kyle and Stan walk in.

Kyle

Ehheh, Cartman, what the hell are you doing?

Stan

Yeah, you missed them turning around.

Cartman

You guys, something's wrong.

Stan

What?

Cartman

I think... I.. just.. saw the funniest thing I'll ever see. And I... think... I... blew a funny fuse.

Kyle

[quizzically] Blew a funny fuse?

Cartman

[turns to face them] It was just too much and my sense of humor overloaded. [turns away] I don't think anything will ever be funny again. Oh God. What have I got?

+++++


Outside, on the sidewalk. Six kids are walking along: Kyle, Stan, Tolkien, Clyde, Craig, and Tweek

Clyde

You mean they both have butts instead of heads?

Stan

Yeah, dude, we'll show you. They're over at Kenny's.

Tolkien

How do they eat?

Stan

How the hell should we know? [the kids stop before a house]

Kyle

Butters! Hey Butters! You have to check this out!

Butters

[opens his bedroom window and looks down] W-what?

Kyle

You gotta come to Kenny's house with us.

Stan

There's these two people with asses where their heads should be.

Butters

Ahah-I can't, fellas. Ah-I'm grounded for lookin' stupid in my school picture.

Stan

But dude, you gotta see it; it's hysterical!

Linda

Butters can't come out and play, boys. He thinks it's funny to look like a jackass in his school pictures that I have to pay for!

Butters

Huh, but I told you mom: ah-I didn't mean to look... like a jackass, eh. It just happened.

Linda

You made a goofy face!

Butters

No! That's just what I look like. See?

Linda

[turns around and looks up] ...Don't you make that face at me, young man!

Butters

I'm not makin' a face, mom!

Linda

Stop it!

Craig

...Come on, we wanna see the ass people.

Kyle

Alright. [the kids turn left and walk away]

Linda

Fine Butters! If you don't wanna stop making that stupid face at me, you can just stay in your room for another week! [goes inside and shuts the door.]

Butters

Another week? [turns around and drops down] I hate my stupid face.

+++++


Mr. Mackey's office, day. Cartman is on the couch laying on his back...

Mr. Mackey

Okay Eric, as your counselor, uh I want you to feel comfortable talking about anything, m'kay?

Cartman

Mr. Mackey, is it possible that you can see something so funny that it ruins your sense of humor forever?

Mr. Mackey

Well, I can't think of anything that would be THAT funny.

Cartman

Two people with asses for heads. Ever since I saw them I can't laugh at anything.

Mr. Mackey

Oh, I see, well... Well, what did you used to think was funny?

Cartman

You know, all the usual stuff. Dirty jokes, funny movies, seeing someone die... [Mr. Mackey is shocked by the last one] This morning, I even saw a little girl get her fingers caught in a car door and... I couldn't laugh. I mean I... I knew it was funny, but I couldn't laugh.

Mr. Mackey

Well Eric, I suppose that, just like everything else, laughter can be relative - in, in other words, sometimes people see somethin' so scary that nothin' else scares them, so, the same could be true for funny things.

Cartman

[turns over to look at Mr. Mackey] So does that mean I'll never laugh again?

Mr. Mackey

It's possible, hm'kay? [Cartman turns over and lays on his back again] But you know, if you have completely lost your sense of humor, you can always become a writer for the show, "Friends" [laughs at the unexpected humor in his own statement]. Ohokahay, huhuh.

Cartman

Ugh.

+++++


The McCormick house, later. The Thompsons' car is parked outside, on the street. Inside, the McCormicks, the Thompsons and the receptionist are seated around the coffee table. A brick has replaced two of its legs. Kenny stands beside his mother.

Carol

...and so you see, our son was just playing a joke and the little fat kid put it on the carton.

Martha

Yes. Yes, I see.

Carol

Kenny, don't you think you owe the Thompsons an apology? [Kenny just stares at them]

Martha

...No, it was foolish for us to get our hopes up.

Steven

It was just such a coincidence, considering the photo. You may not have realized this, but Martha and I have buttocks where our heads should be.

Stuart and Carol

Really?

Receptionist

Mr. and Mrs. Thompson, how long has it been since you've seen your son?

Steven

Tommy disappeared when he was only seven.

Martha

[leans into Steven's right shoulder, sobbing, and he comforts her] Oh, Steven, it's like it's all happening all over again. [sobs uncontrollably]

Carol

[rises to soother her also] There there now. [looks around, then walks off]

Receptionist

Please, Mrs. Thompson, it'll be alright. [Martha continues sobbing] Listen, the South Park Dairy Company is the country's largest. We find lost children all the time. [Carol returns with a box of tissues. Martha takes one and blows her "nose" with it. Stuart walks off again, and Martha resumes sobbing and blowing her nose] We can help you find Tommy with the company's database![Martha blows her "nose" even harder and louder.]

Carol

[holds her arms out as if to keep Martha away] Yes, well, aaah-I'll help you find your son. Just stop cryin', Please, for the love of God, stop cryin'!

Martha

[blows her nose again and sobs some more, then tries to compose herself] Ah, agh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. [blows her nose]

Receptionist

Mr. Thompson, how did your son become missing? Was he abducted?

Steven

Yes. He was in the care of our nanny at the time.

Martha

The nanny that we trusted so much took off with him and we still don't know why. [Stan and Tolkien are now looking in through the window. Kyle joins them. Martha sneezes] We think perhaps she wanted a child of her own. [a couple of hands try to get a grip on the window sill]

Receptionist

And this was back in Wisconsin? [Craig soon rises into view outside]

Steven

Yes, but we last heard the nanny was heading west. [Tolkien, Craig, and Kyle start laughing. Tweek pops up and pushes Craig out of the way to have a good look. Stan laughs, and Craig climbs up on Tweek.] That's why we thought Colorado made sssssense.

Martha

We've tried every avenue to find him, [Officer Barbrady happens by and says something. The kids jump] but, we've never tried the milk company. [Stan seems to tell Barbrady to come over and look at the ass people.]

Receptionist

Well you just give us a try. I think you'll find that South Park Milk [Barbrady approaches] is not only the best resource for finding kids, [Barbrady's eyes widen] but also the best producer of the freshest 2% lowfat milk the world can offer. [Barbrady walks away and calls out to some people, then returns to the window]

Martha

Thank you. Thank you so much for helping us. [Mr. Garrison walks by and looks in, then seems to say "Holy crap!"]

Steven

This certainly is a friendly town. [Sheila shows up behind Kyle] You've all been sssssso wonderful. [Chef shows up behind Mr. Garrison]

Martha

Yes, I'm so grateful I just wanna cry again.

Stuart and wife, and Receptionist

[they hold their palms out] NO!

+++++


The Bijou Theater, day. "Grossout Comedy 8" is playing there. Inside, Cartman sits amid a bunch of older folk

Male 1

Dude, why are you wearing Shalayna's panties? [the audience laughs; Cartman sits there, glum, his head resting on his left hand.]

Male 2

I have to wear Shalayna's panties. Lisa's were in the wash. [the audience laughs; Cartman just blinks.] Look, can we just get this over with?

Male 1

But dude, I can't French-kiss him. He's my grandpa! [the audience laughs]

Male 2

Come on, dude.

Male 1

Oh, alright Here it goes. Come'ere, Grandpa.

Audience

Aww

Cartman

[out of sorts] Oh, dude, oh.

Jonesy

[noticing] Dude, what's wrong with you?

Cartman

Nothing's wrong with me. Uh-

Male 1

Well, I'm glad that's over with. We'd better go back to the house now to see how Chris is doing. [Cartman fakes a laugh and the audience turns to look at him. Cartman manages a few weak laughs, then sinks in his seat]

+++++


Dairy Gold Milk Company, day. An official leads the Thompsons through the factory. Cows are lined up in their stalls eating from personal troughs.

President

Uh Mr. and Mrs. Thompson, as President of the South Park Milk Company, I want to apologize personally for printing that falsified picture on our milk cartons.

Steven

Please, please. It's not your fault.

President

Ye-yes, but here at South Park Milk we strive for excellence. For instance, we are now entering the extraction room. [stops] As you can see, we keep it close to the refrigeration room. That way we can get the milk to the container as fast as possible. [commercial music comes up] That's why some say South Park milk tastes like you're suckin' it right from the cow's tits yourself.

Martha

Amazing.

President

[a worker comes by with some food] Here, try a glass of our cold Vitamin D. And our fresh scones. [the Thompsons take some milk and scones and start eating]

Steven

Delicious.

Martha

Oh, excuse me. A little... difficult to drink with our condition. [the couple set their milks back on the tray and the worker walks out.]

Steven

Martha and I actually have buttocks where our heads should be.

President

Really? Well. And in here we have our Missing Child Resource Center. [leads them into a large darkened room]

Martha

Oh my, isn't this impressive?

President

Yes. With the Kelrom 4000, Mrs. Garthunk can search a database of over 30 million missing child cases.

Mrs. Garthunk

[the receptionist] We'll start the computer on a data search. Now, when did your son turn up missing?

Steven

Well, it was 1982. Tommy was only six at the time.

Mrs. Garthunk

Alright then. Computer...

Computer

Workiiing.

Mrs. Garthunk

Run a scan of missing children since 1982. Check for physical birth defects called TPS.

Computer

TPS. Torsonic Polarity Syndrome. Child missing since 1982. Workiiing.

President

So you actually haven't seen your son in over 20 years?

Martha

That's right.

Mrs. Garthunk

But then, why did you think the picture of Kenny was him. Wouldn't your son be much older now?

Steven

Yes, but since he appeared to be at least eight in the photo, [takes a bite out of the scone and chews it] we assumed someone had seen him since we did.

Martha

[pulls out a baby picture] This is the only photo we have of our little Tommy. [in diapers in a crib, looking like he's just finished eating]

Mrs. Garthunk

It's gonna take quite a while for the computer to do a scan of all missing kids.

President

Well, why don't we let Mrs. Garthunk do her work, and I'll take you two out for some good old Colorado chili. [walks out. The Thompsons follow him]

Steven

We don't really like chili; it makes us throw up.

+++++


Cartman's house, living room, day. The door bell rings and Eric answers it. Jimmy stands at the entrance

Jimmy

Well, hello, Eric. I was really glad you called me, very much.

Cartman

Jimmy! Thank God! Get in here! [goes inside, and Jimmy follows, closing the door]

Jimmy

What's this all about?

Cartman

Jimmy, you've always been my favorite standup comic. You've gotta help me. I've lost my sense of humor.

Jimmy

Gee, that's a terrible thing, Eric. Um comedy can be the best therapy, very much.

Cartman

I just have to find my funny bone again! Just try and make me laugh.

Jimmy

Oh, I don't think that'll be hard. I've been working on my rr... routine.

Cartman

Okay, let me have it.

Jimmy

Okay. Try this one on for size: Why did the... pigeon cross the road?

Cartman

Okay, why?

Jimmy

Because it was having sex with the chihi... Because it was having sex with the ch-hi-hi... Because it was having sex with the ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch... eh, it was having sex with the ch-ch-hiicken. [Cartman doesn't respond]

Cartman

...Naw, see? Somethng's wrong. I'm not laughing.

Jimmy

Wow, what a great audience... How about this classic? Knock-knock.

Cartman

Who's there?

Jimmy

Orange.

Cartman

Orange who?

Jimmy

Orange you glad I didn't say banoo'n? Orange you glad I didn't say banoo'n? Orange you glad I didn't say bbb? Orange you glad I didn't say beh buhuhnnnaana?

Cartman

[stares back] ...naw, that didn't work either.

Jimmy

Wow, w-what a great audience... Knock-knock.

Cartman

Who's there?

Jimmy

An interrupting ca'ow.

Cartman

An interrupting cow who

Jimmy

[interrupting] Moooooo! [...no response.] ...What a terrific audience. [the two of them stand in the middle of the living room looking at each other]

+++++


Dairy Gold Milk Company, day. Mrs. Garthunk is still at the computer doing her search

Mrs. Garthunk

Hah, let's see. The Dallas-Ft. Wroth area. I haven't tried there yet. Computer?

Computer

Workiiing.

Mrs. Garthunk

Scan for any children reported found in the Dallas-Ft. Wroth area, with a facial deformity.

Computer

Workiiing. [some computer noises] Negative.

Mrs. Garthunk

Ugh. This is hopeless! ...Wait a minute, let's try it this way: Computer?

Computer

Workiiing.

Mrs. Garthunk

Scan databanks for children who reported their parents missing.

Computer

Workiiing. [some computer noises] One million six thousand hits.

Mrs. Garthunk

Alright, then break it down to claims in the past twenty years.

Computer

Workiiing. [some computer noises] Three hundred twenty-one thousand hits.

Mrs. Garthunk

Alright, now run a scan on homogenized versus pasteurized skim milk.

Computer

In skim form, homogenized has longer shelf life by 2.3 weeks.

Mrs. Garthunk

Okaaay, okay, now give me a breakdown of people who are seeking their parents who also suffer from a disease called T P S.

Computer

Torsonic Polarity Syndrome, plus, a claim to not know parents: one match

Mrs. Garthunk

Bingo. Do you have a photo

Computer

Printiiing. [the screen reads "Processing". A picture starts appearing on screen]

Mrs. Garthunk

My God. Oh my God!

+++++


Sidewalk, day. Six boys walk down the street again, only Kenny has replaced Tweek among the boys. They stop at Butters' house again,and again, Kyle calls out.

Kyle

Butters! Hey Butters!

Butters

[opens his windows; has a paper bag over his head] Hehyeah?

Kyle

They found the butt-face people's son, Butters. They're gonna have a big reunion at the milk company!

Butters

Aw gee, thah-at sounds swell, fellas, but I can't go 'cause I'm still havin' behavioral problems.

Stan

Why are you wearing a paper bag on your head?

Butters

Uh, my parents are makin' me wear this paper bag until I learn... to stop makin' silly faces all the time. They've really had it up to [raises his hand high] here with me.

Stephen

Butters? Are you ready to stop with the stupid faces?

Butters

[hops down to the floor] I sure am, Dad!

Stephen

Alright, you can take the paper bag off.

Butters

[removes the bag] Thanks, Dad! Ah I'm sorry I was bad-

Stephen

Oh, very funny, young man! You think it's clever to make yourself up like a girl?!

Butters

Hububut Dad, ah I didn't lick a-

Stephen

Did you use your mother's makeup?! She's gonna be furious!

Butters

Stephen

Butters

Kyle

Dude, that poor kid. [walks off]

Clyde

Yeah, we gotta remember to kick his ass tomorrow. [turns with the other boys and follows Kyle off. Butters slams his windows shut]

Cartman's room, day. Cartman sits on his bed dejected. He's unwrapped a box and a gun sits on his bed to his left, a notepad and pencil to his right. He picks up the pad and pencil and writes...

Cartman

Dear Mom: I can no longer stand to be without a sense of humor. Without laughter, the world is a cold and sad place, and I can't go out to face it anymore. Please tell everyone why I won't be at school.

+++++


He sets the notepad down and looks at it for a moment, then he reaches over for the gun. He opens his mouth and puts the barrel of the gun in... and bites it off. It's a chocolate gun, and he sets the remainder down on the bed again

Cartman

And please buy me more chocolate guns. I'm starting to run out.

+++++


He picks up the chocolate again and takes another bite. Then he looks at the box the gun came in

Cartman

Please get the kind with marshmallow inside. I don't like the peanut-butter filled one.Eric.

Dairy Gold Milk Company, day. A TV 4 news van and crew are present. Some of the factory workers are present in the background as the president of the company stands behind some microphones. The Thompsons stand next to the president. A sign behind them asks, "Got Missing Kids?"

President

And so it is with great pride that we have flown little Billy Thompson out here, to be reunited with his parents for the first time in twenty years. [Stan, Kyle, Kenny, Craig, Tolkien, and Clyde show up and watch.] Mrs. Garthunk? [moves aside as she steps up]

Mrs. Garthunk

Thank you, Mr. President. I'm proud to be an employee of South Park Milk, [music plays] which to date has found over a hundred thousand missing kids, and, led the way in the fight against curdling. Mr. and Mrs. Thompson, your son grew up not knowing who his parents were. [a shot of the Thompson couple] But he was strong and resilient, [a shot of the crowd] and ended up becoming very successful. I think it will amaze you as it will all of us to learn that your son... is Ben Affleck! [a picture is taken. The people in the crowd look puzzled]

President

Come around here, Ben! [a man makes his way through the crowd as the people clap and cheer. It's Ben Affleck]

Ben Affleck

Mom! Dad!

Steven

[opens his arms] Son!

Martha

[opens her arms] Oh, son! [Ben walks into their embrace as more pictures are taken]

Cartman

[walking up to the other boys] What's goin' on?

Stan

Dude, the ass-faces' son is Ben Affleck!

Steven

Oh, our same ol' Ben!

Martha

Oh, I'm so happy! [starts kissing him with her ass-face cheeks. Ben grimaces]

Mr. Garrison

Wow, I never realized Ben had TPS, but I definitely see the resemblance now. [Mrs. Thompson is still crying and kissing Ben.]

Steven

Aw, son. [begins kissing him, and Ben grimaces again]

President

Isn't this wonderful?

Photographer

[gets into position] Okay gang, give me a big smile. [the Thompsons face the camera with Ben and the picture is taken. The crowd then disperses, and a man behind the boys is writing something on a note pad. He walks away as well.]

Kyle

Well, looks like everything turned out alright for them.

Cartman

Yeah, I guess now we'll have to call him Ben Assfleck. [breaks into a grin and starts laughing] Ben Assfleck, say that's funny.

Stan

[noticing] Hey, you're laughing, Cartman.

Cartman

Hehey, you're right! Oho, this is great! Ben Assfleck! [laughs some more.]

Kyle

Well wait a minute. Don't you see what happened?

Cartman

A-heh, what?

Kyle

Everything turned out okay for those people. And so now you can laugh.

Stan

Huh?

Kyle

When Cartman first opened the door, and saw the Thompsons, he felt bad for playing a joke on them. Now that everything's turned out alright, he's able to laugh.

Stan

Oh, you're right. Cartman had a feeling of remorse.

Cartman

E-heh. No no no, I blew a funny fuse.

Kyle

There is no such thing as a funny fuse, Cartman. You felt bad.

Cartman

[silent sigh] Whatever. All I know is that I can laugh again. I'm gonna go home and eat another chocolate gun. Come on, Kenny! [Kenny follows Cartman, and they begin to cross the road. Kenny remains behind Cartman, and the sound of a motorcycle draws close]

Motorcycle Driver

[running over Kenny] Dangit! [Cartman spins to see Kenny's bloody body on the road... and roars with laughter]

+++++


Stan and Kyle face Cartman. Behind them the crowd consists of only the camera crew, Mrs. Garthunk, Ben Affleck and the Thompsons, and the workers

Stan

 Wow, Cartman actually felt bad for somebody and couldn't laugh at them.

Kyle

Our little man is growing up, Stan. He's growing up.

Stan

Yeah, I guess we all are. Maybe things are finally gonna start getting a more sophisticated around here.

+++++
