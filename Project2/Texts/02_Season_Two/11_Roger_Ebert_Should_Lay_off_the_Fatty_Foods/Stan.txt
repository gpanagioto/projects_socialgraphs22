Can't we just be like normal third-graders for a little while? I don't know, like, learn about art 'n music and go on field trips and stuff. It's boring. Whoa, dude! You're only as old as us; shouldn't you be in school? This is stupid. Me neither, but... I loved the planetarium. I don't know. I don't even remember what happened. Yeah, mine too. Van Gelder?? What the hell are you doing on our bus?! Mr. Garrison, there's some freaky kid from the planetarium on our bus! Alright, dude. Mellow out, jeez! That's a haiku? Oh. No. Yeah. What's a discharge? Yeah, I wanna go to the planetarium again, too.  Yeah, why ''do'' we wanna go again so soon? Where have you been, Cartman? Does that mean you're gonna be on that Cheesy Poofs commercial? Dude, what just happened? Come on, we've gotta get out of here before something bad happens. Mr. Garrison, we think that the planetarium guy is- Dude, this isn't right. We're kids, dude. We don't volunteer for anything. Come on, we've gotta see what's going on in there. Kenny, you go out there and tell us what you see. He hits this switch- Yeah, I guess so. I don't know. This says "maximum." Oh my God, we've killed Kenny! Dude, I told you something was up with this place! ...and then we turned the dial, and Kenny went into a kind of hypnosis. Yeah, pretty sure. What other crime in South Park? Oh, no! They got Chef, too! Why are you doing this, dude? Mr. Mackey! Get over here and untie us! Oh my God! Dr. Adams! Yeah. With nobody around to say anything.
