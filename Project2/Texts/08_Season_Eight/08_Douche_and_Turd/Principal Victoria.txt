We've simply had it with your son, Mr. and Mrs. Marsh. Voting just doesn't appear to be important to him. Well, my hands are tied. We can no longer have Stan's behavior jeopardizing the other children. He must be removed. No, I'm afraid it's worse than that. By county law I'm bound to enforce the harshest punishment possible. No. Banishment. You can appeal to the city council, but I don't think it'll do any good. Your son must leave South Park, never to return.
