It is a glorious spring morning and literally, thousands have gathered for the royal wedding.  Prince takes his place next to the large vat of butterscotch pudding. Oh, and here she comes. Yes, there she is! The aboot to be Princess of Canada. Isn't she ravishing, so innocent of heart, so strong in body, so hot in the face? She is indeed the living symbol of our great country. My God, she's beautiful. Canadian prince now dipping his arms into the pudding.  This is certainly breaking with tradition now. Canadians in attendance cannot believe their eyes. Widespread panic.  The princess now giving the Canadian Medal of Courage to Ugly Bob, and also to Scott, who is of course a giant dick, and Katuktuk of the Yukon. And the medal of course made of white chocolate, as is tradition. What a glorious day for Canada, and therefore, the world. The duke of Calgary standing up and putting on a fake beard, a tradition passed down since the birth of Canada. The princess now knighting Sir Ike Broflovski, giving him three kisses and a pair of socks, as is tradition. And now the scraping off of the pudding. And now the scraping off of the pudding.  He's really making a good go of it. What a glorious day for Canada, and therefore of course, the world.
