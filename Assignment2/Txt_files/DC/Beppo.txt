'''Beppo''' is a [[fictional]] [[monkey]] appearing in books published by [[DC Comics]], primarily those featuring [[Superman]]. Created by [[Otto Binder]] and [[George Papp]], he first appeared in ''[[Superboy (comic book)|Superboy]]'' #76 (October 1959).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fleisher |first1=Michael L. |title=The Original Encyclopedia of Comic Book Heroes, Volume Three: Superman |date=2007 |publisher=DC Comics |isbn=978-1-4012-1389-3 |page=15}}</ref> He made sixteen appearances in ''Superman'' comics during the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Schelly |first1=William |title=American Comic Book Chronicles: The 1950s |date=2013 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=9781605490540 |page=215}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Despite his resemblance to an Earth monkey, due to [[convergent evolution]] producing analogous species to fill similar ecological niches, Beppo is from the planet [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |last2=Pasko |first2=Martin |title=The Essential Superman Encyclopedia |date=2010 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=978-0-345-50108-0 |page=26}}</ref> He was originally one of [[Jor-El]]'s test animals. Luckily for him, Beppo decided to stow away aboard baby [[Superman|Kal-El]]'s rocket to Earth and was thus saved from its destruction. Upon landing, Beppo hopped out unseen and went off on his own for some months. Beppo lived in a jungle and handled himself quite well, since as a Kryptonian monkey he had the usual array of super-powers.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Eury |first1=Michael |title=The Krypton Companion |date=2006 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=9781893905610 |page=36}}</ref>

One day Beppo, using his telescopic vision, spotted Kal-El, now a toddler living in [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]] with the [[Jonathan and Martha Kent|Kents]]. Beppo quickly flew to Smallville and, being a monkey, secretly caused all sorts of havoc. Ma and Pa Kent initially blamed baby Clark for Beppo's super-powered monkeyshines, but they soon discovered the truth. The Kents fretted that Clark's secret might be exposed by the super-antics of the Simian of Steel but, as it turned out, their worry was needless. It wasn't long before Beppo accidentally set off some [[Independence Day (United States)|4th of July]] fireworks stored in the Kent garage. The explosions spooked Beppo, who took off into space. The panicked Beppo kept on going when he saw a passing comet, which he thought was more fireworks chasing him. When Beppo failed to return, the Kents presumed he'd gotten lost out there somewhere. Beppo's origin is related in "The Super-Monkey from Krypton!", the cover story in ''Superboy'' #76 (October 1959). At the end of the story, which is told in [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] by teenaged Clark, the reader is informed that Beppo made his way back to Earth before too long.

Many years later, Beppo encountered [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]], who introduced him to [[Krypto|Krypto the Superdog]] and [[Streaky the Supercat]]. Beppo went on to join the [[Legion of Super-Pets]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rovin |first1=Jeff |title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Cartoon Animals |date=1991 |publisher=Prentice Hall Press |isbn=0-13-275561-0 |accessdate=31 March 2020 |url=https://archive.org/details/illustratedencyc00rovi/page/24/mode/2up/ |page=24}}</ref>

Beppo was [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] out of existence following the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' limited series. He was briefly returned to existence by the [[Psycho-Pirate]] during the 2005-06 storyline ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', and then appeared in ''[[Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds]]'' #5.

==Powers, abilities, and equipment==
Beppo possessed the same powers and abilities as a Kryptonian adult, although his physical abilities were proportionate to his smaller size and species.

==Other versions==
* Beppo is one of the animals in Superman's artificial reality farm in ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'' #1 (May 1996). 
* He also appears in the out-of-continuity ''[[Tiny Titans]]'', alongside Streaky the Super-Cat, as Supergirl's pet.

==In other media==
* Beppo is referenced in the ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' episode "Monkey Fun" as the name of [[Lois Lane]]'s childhood toy, a stuffed monkey that played "[[Pop Goes the Weasel]]". The toy was also the favorite of [[Titano]], a test chimp used by the space program. When Titano returns to Earth and grows to gargantuan proportions, he can only be calmed down by the sound of Beppo's song ("Pop Goes the Weasel"). 
* A Beppo toy appeared in the ''[[Batman Beyond]]'' episode "Rats".
 There is a character named Chrissy Beppo on Superman and Lois played by Sofia Hasmik https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11949906/fullcredits/
