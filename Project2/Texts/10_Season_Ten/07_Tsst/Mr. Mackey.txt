Mrs. Cartman, we have had it with your son's behavior, mkay?! Little Billy Turner is now being treated at the hospital! You know that's not the point! We have tried at this school to make Eric understand that there are boundaries, mkay?! But frankly, we believe his behavioral problems start at home! Mrs. Cartman, I know this is extremely difficult but, there is help out there for people like you. Have you ever heard of a show called ''Nanny 911?''
