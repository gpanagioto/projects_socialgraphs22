'''Lois Lane''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic books]] published by [[DC Comics]]. Created by writer [[Jerry Siegel]] and artist [[Joe Shuster]], she first appeared in [[Action Comics 1|''Action Comics'' #1]] (June 1938). Lois is an award-winning [[journalist]] for the [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] newspaper the ''[[Daily Planet]]'' and the primary [[Superman and Lois Lane|love interest]] of the [[superhero]] [[Superman]] and his alter ego, [[Clark Kent]]. In DC continuity, she is also his wife and the mother of their son, [[Jon Kent (DC Comics)|Jon Kent]], the newest [[Superboy]] in the [[DC Universe]].

Lois' physical appearance was originally based on [[Joanne Siegel|Joanne Carter]], a model hired by Joe Shuster. For her character, Jerry Siegel was inspired by actress [[Glenda Farrell]]'s portrayal of the fictional reporter [[Torchy Blane]] in a series of films. Siegel took her name from actress [[Lola Lane]].<ref>Letters to the Editor, ''Time'' magazine (May 30, 1988), pp. 6–7.</ref> She was also influenced by the real-life journalist [[Nellie Bly]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Farghaly |first=Nadine|title =Examining Lois Lane: The Scoop on Superman's Sweetheart.|publisher=[[Scarecrow Press, Inc.]]|year=2013|location= Lanham, Maryland|isbn= 978-0810892378|page=44}}</ref>

Depictions of the character have varied spanning the comics and [[Lois Lane in other media|other media adaptations]]. The original [[Golden Age (comics)|Golden Age]] version of Lois Lane, as well as versions of her from the 1970s onwards, portrays Lois as a dauntless journalist and intellectually equal to Superman. During the [[Silver Age of Comics]], she was the star of ''[[Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane]]'', a comic book series that had a light and humorous tone. Beginning in 2015, she is the protagonist in the young adult novel series, ''Lois Lane'', by writer Gwenda Bond.

Lois has appeared in [[Lois Lane in other media|various media adaptations]] and is among the best-known female comic book characters. Actress [[Noel Neill]] first portrayed Lois Lane in the 1940s ''[[Superman (serial)|Superman]]'' film series and later reprised her role in the 1950s television series ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]]'', replacing [[Phyllis Coates]] from season two. [[Margot Kidder]] played the character in four [[Superman (1978 film)|Superman films]] in the 1970s and 1980s, [[Kate Bosworth]] in the 2006 film ''[[Superman Returns]]'', and [[Amy Adams]] in the [[DC Extended Universe]]. [[Teri Hatcher]] portrayed Lois in the 1990s television series ''[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'' and [[Erica Durance]] in the 2000s series ''[[Smallville]]''. [[Elizabeth Tulloch]] currently plays the character in the [[Arrowverse]] television series ''[[Superman & Lois]]''. Actresses who have voiced Lois in animated adaptations include [[Joan Alexander]] in the [[Superman (1940s animated film series)|Fleischer Superman animated film series]] and [[Dana Delany]] in ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', among others.

==Creation==
Writer [[Jerry Siegel]] first conceived Lois Lane in 1934, when Siegel and [[Joe Shuster]] were still developing Superman.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Jerry Siegel & Joe Shuster Interview|publisher=Nemo: the Classic Comics Library No. 2|date=August 1983|page=11}}</ref> One of the major influence on Lois' characterization was actress [[Glenda Farrell]] and her portrayal of the fictional reporter [[Torchy Blane]] in a series of [[Warner Bros.]] films. The Torchy Blane movies were popular second features during the later 1930s. On the conception of Lois Lane, Siegel stated in the 1988 ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine:

{{blockquote|My wife Joanne was Joe's original art model for Superman's girlfriend Lois Lane back in the 1930s. Our heroine was, of course, a working girl whose priority was grabbing scoops. What inspired me in the creation was Glenda Farrell, the movie star who portrayed Torchy Blane, a gutsy, beautiful headline-hunting reporter, in a series of exciting motion pictures. Because the name of the actress Lola Lane (who also played Torchy) appealed to me, I called my character Lois Lane. Strangely, the characterization of Lois is amazingly like the real-life personality of my lovely wife.<ref>{{cite web|last=Siegel |first=Joanne |url=http://www.supermanhomepage.com/comics/comics.php?topic=articles/lois-lane |title=The True Inspiration for Lois Lane |publisher=Superman Home Page |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721154956/http://www.supermanhomepage.com/comics/comics.php?topic=articles%2Flois-lane |archive-date=July 21, 2015 |url-status=live |access-date=July 19, 2015 }}</ref>}}

[[File:Lois Lane Joanne Siegel.jpg|thumb|An early sketch of Lois Lane by [[Joe Shuster]], modeled on [[Joanne Siegel|Joanne Carter]].]]

Artist Joe Shuster based Lois' physical appearance on a model named [[Joanne Siegel|Joanne Carter]]. Carter had placed an ad in the ''[[Cleveland Plain Dealer]]'' newspaper in the Situation Wanted column, advertising herself as a model.<ref>This ad appeared in ''The Plain Dealer'' on 13 January 1935, according to [https://twitter.com/bradjricca/status/936617623223242753?lang=en this Twitter post] by Brad Ricca. Brad Ricca is a historian who wrote a biography of Siegel and Shuster (''Super Boys'').</ref> Shuster corresponded with her and hired her as the model for Lois Lane. Shuster's depiction of Lois was modeled on her hairstyle and facial features. "To me she was Lois Lane. She was a great inspiration for me, though. She encouraged me, she was very enthusiastic about the strip; it meant a lot to me." Shuster said about Joanne Carter.<ref name="Joanne Carter"/>

Joanne Carter married co-creator Jerry Siegel in 1948. On working with Joe Shuster for Lois Lane, Carter said in the 1983 ''[[Nemo (magazine)|Nemo]]'' magazine interview: "Joe was redrawing the strip, and it was going to be more realistic, rather than cartoony. I used to model for him every Saturday until he had enough drawings. He made so many stock drawings that it got to a point where he didn't need any more. We became such good friends by that time we decided we would always stay friends."<ref name= "Joanne Carter">{{cite book|title=The Jerry Siegel & Joe Shuster Interview|publisher=Nemo: the Classic Comics Library #2|date=August 1983|page=14}}</ref>

Aspects of Lois' personality have varied over the years, depending on the comic book writers handling of the character and American social attitudes toward women at the time. In most incarnations, she is shown to be an independent person who is smart, determined and strong-willed. Her physical appearance has varied over the years, depending either on contemporary fashion or media adaptations. In the 1990s, when the television series ''[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'' began airing Lois received a haircut that made her look more like actress [[Teri Hatcher]], and her eyes were typically violet to match her character on ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]''. From the late 1980s through the 1990s she was depicted with auburn hair in the comic books.
 
In the 1940s, Lois had a newspaper comic strip, ''[[Superman (comic strip)#Spinoff|Lois Lane, Girl Reporter]]'', a direct spin-off of the Superman comic strip running at the time. A similar title comic series began appearing in the ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'' comic book in 1944, starting with ''Superman'' #28. In 1958, DC Comics gave Lois a comic book series, ''[[Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane]]''. The series focuses on her solo adventures and start publication in April 1958.

==Fictional character biography==

===Golden Age===
[[Image:Superman27.PNG|thumb|The Golden Age Lois Lane and Superman, from the cover of ''Superman'' #27 (March–April 1944), art by [[Wayne Boring]].]]

In the [[Golden Age of Comics|Golden Age]] comics, Lois was an aggressive, career-minded reporter for the ''[[Daily Star (DC Comics)|Daily Star]]'' (the newspaper's name was changed to the ''Daily Planet'' in ''Action Comics'' #23 in 1940). After Clark Kent joined the paper and Superman debuted around the same time, Lois found herself attracted to Superman but displeased with her new journalistic competition in the form of Kent.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fleisher |first1=Michael L. |title=The Original Encyclopedia of Comic Book Heroes, Volume Three: Superman |date=2007 |publisher=DC Comics |isbn=978-1-4012-1389-3 |pages=145–162, 409–420}}</ref>

Starting early as the 1940s, Lois began to suspect that Clark Kent was Superman, and started to make various attempts at uncovering his [[secret identity]], all of which backfired because of Superman's efforts. The first such story appears in ''Superman'' #17 (July–August 1942).<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Jerry Siegel|Siegel, Jerry]]| penciller= [[Joe Shuster|Shuster, Joe]]| inker= Sikela, John| story= Man Or Superman?| title= [[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]| issue= #17 | date= July–August 1942}}</ref> This theme became particularly pronounced in the 1950s and 1960s [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age comic books]].

Lois gained her first series of stories (without Superman) starting with ''Superman'' #28 (May–June 1944),<ref>{{cite comic| writer=Cameron, Don| penciller=Dobrotka, Ed|story=Lois Lane, Girl Reporter story–The Suicidal Swain| title=Superman| issue=#28|date=June 1944}}</ref> ''Lois Lane, Girl Reporter'', running in the ''Superman'' comic book for a number of years, had Lois defeating bad guys and getting front-page stories on her own, without any help from Superman.

In the Golden Age comics, Lois had a niece named Susie Tompkins, whose main trait was getting into trouble by telling exaggerated [[tall tale]]s and fibs to adults.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Siegel, Jerry| penciller= Sikela, John| inker=Dobrotka, Ed| story= Cinderella – a la Superman| title= Action Comics | issue= 59| date= April 1943}}</ref> Susie's last appearance was in ''Superman'' #95 (February 1955).<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[William Woolfolk|Woolfolk, Bill]]| penciller= [[Wayne Boring|Boring, Wayne]]| inker=Kaye, Stan| story= Susie's Enchanted Isle| title= Superman| issue= #95| date= February 1955}}</ref> Subsequent comics presented Lois' only sibling, Lucy, as single and childless.

===Silver Age and Bronze Age===
When the reading audience of superhero comic books became predominately young boys in the mid to late 1950s, the focus of Superman stories shifted toward science fiction inspired plots involving [[extraterrestrials]], [[fantasy literature|fantasy]] creatures, and bizarre plots.

Lois' main interests in various late 1950s and 1960s stories became vying with her rival Lana Lang for Superman's affections, attempting to prove Clark Kent and Superman were one and the same or otherwise getting Superman into marriage. Superman's rationale for resisting her matrimonial desires was that marrying her would put her in increased danger from his enemies and that she could not keep his secret identity hidden. Regardless, Lois married several times in the Superman stories of this era, including to a Superman impostor from Kandor, the villainous Zak-Kul<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Otto Binder|Binder, Otto]]| penciller= Boring, Wayne| inker= Kaye, Stan| story= The Shrinking Superman!| title= Action Comics| issue= #245| date= October 1958}}</ref> and a man from the future.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Bernstein, Robert| penciller= Boring, Wayne| inker= Kaye, Stan| story= The Man Who Married Lois Lane| title= Superman| issue= #136| date= April 1960}}</ref> All these marriages were either annulled or otherwise forgotten.

Lois became more and more popular during the 1950s, and after appearing as the lead character in two issues of DC Comics' ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' in 1957, DC created an ongoing series for Lois, titled ''[[Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane]]''.<ref>[[Alexander C. Irvine|Irvine, Alex]] "1950s" in Dolan, p. 85: "The future title ''Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane'' got a tryout in issues #9 and #10 of ''Showcase'', when Lois Lane stepped in as the lead feature."</ref><ref>Irvine "1950s" in Dolan, p. 89: "Following her successful test run in the pages of ''Showcase'' #9 and #10, Lois Lane got her own title ''Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane'' in which Superman was ever the prankster."</ref> The series ran for 137 issues, beginning in April 1958 to October 1974. Most stories were about Lois' romance with Superman, and were drawn by artist [[Kurt Schaffenberger]]. Schaffenberger's rendition of Lois became cited by many as the "definitive" version of Lois, and he was often asked by DC editor [[Mort Weisinger]] to redraw other artists' depictions of Lois Lane in other DC titles where she appeared.<ref>{{cite book|last = Voger|first = Mark|author2=Voglesong, Kathy |chapter= Front Page Romance |title = Hero Gets Girl!: The Life & Art of Kurt Schaffenberger|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|year= 2003|location= Raleigh, North Carolina|pages = 43–45| chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8_mF5qdrMR0C&q=Front+Page+Romance+Kurt+Schaffenberger&pg=PA43| isbn = 1-893905-29-2

The series ''Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane'' became one of DC's most popular titles, the third best-selling comic in 1962 and 1965.<ref name="1962 Comic Book Sales Figures"/><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.comichron.com/yearlycomicssales/1960s/1965.html|title= 1965 Comic Book Sales Figures|first= John Jackson|last= Miller|date= n.d.|publisher= Comichron: The Comics Chronicles|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20151117024222/http://www.comichron.com/yearlycomicssales/1960s/1965.html|archive-date= November 17, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The title featured the first appearance of the Silver Age [[Catwoman]], after an absence from the comics for over a decade.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= [[Leo Dorfman|Dorfman, Leo]]|penciller= Schaffenberger, Kurt|inker= Schaffenberger, Kurt|story= The Catwoman's Black Magic!|title= Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane |issue= 70|date= November 1966}}</ref>

While Lois is suspicious of Superman's secret identity as early as ''Superman'' #7 (1940), her suspicions grew during the early Silver Age, with many stories in her series focusing on her attempts to prove Superman and Clark Kent were one and the same. Stories showed Superman using various means to protect his secret identity from Lois, including his [[Superman robot]]s or Batman disguising himself as Clark/Superman.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Alvin Schwartz (comics)|Schwartz, Alvin]]| penciller= Swan, Curt| inker= Kaye, Stan| story= Batman – Double for Superman!| title= [[World's Finest Comics]]| issue= #71| date= July–August 1954}}</ref>

By the end of the 1960s, as attitudes toward women's role in American society changed, Lois' character changed as well. In ''Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane'' #80 (Jan. 1968), the character's fashions were updated to a then more contemporary look.<ref>McAvennie, Michael "1960s" in Dolan, p. 128: "She started trading in her generic blouse and pencil skirt combinations for a "mod" wardrobe filled with printed dresses, go-go boots, mini skirts, and hot pants."</ref> Stories in the 1970s depicted Lois again as fully capable and less reliant on Superman. She engaged in more adventures without Superman being involved and was much less interested in discovering Superman's secret identity.

Lois had a series featured in ''[[The Superman Family]]'' (an [[anthology]] title started in the mid-1970s after the cancellation of ''[[Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane]]'' and ''[[Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen]]'') from 1974 to 1982. In her series, Lois regularly battled criminals and often defeated them using her quick wits and considerable skill in the Kryptonian [[martial arts|martial art]] of Klurkor, taught to her by Kryptonian survivors in the bottle city of [[Kandor (comics)|Kandor]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Dorfman, Leo| penciller= Schaffenberger, Kurt| inker= [[Pete Costanza|Costanza, Pete]]| story= Courtship, Kryptonian Style!| title=Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane| issue= #78| date= October 1967}}</ref> There were several cameos of the [[New Gods]], including [[Desaad]] and [[Darkseid]]. Lois Lane was the backup series in ''[[Supergirl (comic book)|The Daring New Adventures of Supergirl]]'' in 1982 to 1983.<ref>{{gcdb series|id= 2626|title= The Daring New Adventures of Supergirl}}</ref>

During the Silver and Bronze Age, Lois' backstory became more fully fleshed out, with various stories explaining her life before becoming employed at the ''Daily Planet''. This backstory was attributed to the Lois Lane of Earth-One.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |last2=Pasko |first2=Martin |title=The Essential Superman Encyclopedia |date=2010 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=978-0-345-50108-0 |pages=182–188}}</ref>

As summarized in various stories, Lois was born to Sam and Ella Lane and grew up on their farm in the small town of Pittsdale.<ref name="loislane13" /> At the age of two, Lois suffered [[measles]], and at the age of three, [[Pertussis|whooping cough]].<ref name="supermanfamily206">{{cite comic| writer= [[Marv Wolfman|Wolfman, Marv]]|penciller= [[Bob Oksner|Oksner, Bob]]|inker= [[Vince Colletta|Colletta, Vince]]|story= Have You Ever Told Me the Story of My Life?|title= Superman Family|issue= #206|date= March–April 1981}}</ref> At an unspecified time during Lois' childhood, her younger sister Lucy Lane was born.<ref name="supermanfamily206" /> While Lois was a toddler, she encountered a [[rattlesnake]] in the woods near the Lane family farm.

During Lois' adolescence, she won a youth contest run by the ''Daily Planet'', with the prize being a trip to Metropolis to spend a week working as a cub reporter for the newspaper. There, she first met Clark Kent of Smallville, who was the other winner of the contest. Lois found Clark dull and became more interested in asking him for information about Superboy after learning Clark came from Smallville. During the week in Metropolis, Lois made a bet with Clark to see who would get the most [[Scoop (term)|scoops]], which turned out to be Lois, as Clark was forced to constantly go into action as Superboy. Lois met Superboy for the first time while uncovering a criminal enterprise for one of her stories. At the end of the week, Clark paid off Lois' bet (an [[ice cream sundae]]), and the two returned to their respective hometowns.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Bill Finger|Finger, Bill]]|penciller=Wenzel, Al|inker= [[George Roussos|Roussos, George]]|story= How Clark Kent Met Lois Lane|title= [[Adventure Comics]]|issue= #128|date= May 1948}}</ref> Lois would meet Superboy (but not Clark Kent) again during her adolescence while attending an all-girls summer camp near Smallville.

After the 1985–1986 miniseries ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' writer [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] revised the Superman legend and eliminated the Silver Age version of Lois from continuity. Before this happened, a final non-canonical imaginary story ''[[Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?]]'' was written by [[Alan Moore]], meant as a send-off for the pre-Crisis versions of the characters, including Lois. Published at the same time but in Earth-One continuity was a two-issue miniseries, ''Lois Lane'', in which she investigates missing children.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Mindy Newell|Newell, Mindy]]|penciller= [[Gray Morrow|Morrow, Gray]]|inker= Morrow, Gray|story= Chapter I: Ignorance Was Bliss/Chapter II: Dark Realities|title= Lois Lane|issue= #1|date= August 1986}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Newell, Mindy|penciller= Morrow, Gray|inker= Morrow, Gray|story= Chapter Three: Quicksand/Chapter Four: Quicksand!|title= Lois Lane|issue= 2|date= September 1986}}</ref>

===Modern Age===
[[File:Lois Lane (circa 1986).png|thumb|Lois Lane, as she appears on the cover of ''[[The Man of Steel (comics)|The Man of Steel]]'' #2 (October 1986), art by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]].]]

Lois underwent a character alteration beginning with John Byrne's ''[[The Man of Steel (comics)|The Man of Steel]]'' miniseries, which significantly rewrote [[Origin of Superman|Superman's origin]] and history. In this modern version of events, Lois was portrayed as a tough-as-nails reporter who rarely needed rescuing. She was depicted as strong, opinionated, yet sensitive.

Lois' first real relationship in this version was with [[Gangbuster (DC Comics)|Jose Delgado]], who she later discovered acted as a vigilante. José's legs are shattered in a battle with a [[Lexcorp]] [[cyborg]]/human hybrid gone amok. Delgado eventually recovered. He and Lois would have several on and off experiences together before the relationship completely disintegrated, due to Delgado accepting help from a Lexcorp subsidiary ARL.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Ordway, Jerry|penciller= Ordway, Jerry|inker= Janke, Dennis|story= The Ledge|title= [[Superman (comic book)|The Adventures of Superman]]|issue= #448|date= December 1988}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Ordway, Jerry|penciller= Ordway, Jerry|inker= Janke, Dennis|story= Triple Threat|title= The Adventures of Superman|issue= #450|date= January 1989}}</ref>

Another major change made was that Lois did not fall in love with just Superman, although she was attracted to him. One reason was the revised nature of the Superman/Clark Kent relationship. In the original Silver Age stories, Superman had been the man who disguised himself as Clark Kent. In this newly revised concept, it was Clark Kent who lived a life in which his activity as Superman was decidedly secondary. Lois initially resented the rookie Clark Kent getting the story on Superman as his first piece when she had spent ages trying to get an interview. This sometimes ill-tempered rivalry remained the case until ''[[Superman (comic book)|The Adventures of Superman]]'' #460–463 and ''Action Comics'' #650.

Following Clark's brief rampage under the influence of the [[Eradicator (comics)|Eradicator]], Lois was hesitant to forgive Clark for "selling out" to [[Blaze and Satanus|Collin Thornton]] and running ''Newstime'' Magazine, but forgave him in a span of mere minutes when he returned to ask for his job back. Clark elected to repay Lois by finally letting go of his self-imposed inhibitions and passionately kissed her. The two became a couple, and eventually, Lois accepted a proposal of marriage.<ref name="Superman50" /><ref name="Manning247" /> Clark shortly after revealed to her that he was Superman.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Roger Stern|Stern, Roger]]| penciller= [[Bob McLeod (comics)|McLeod, Bob]]| inker= McLeod, Bob| story= Secrets in the Night| title= Action Comics| issue= #662| date= February 1991| publisher= DC Comics}}</ref><ref>Manning "1990s" in Dolan, p. 249: "With their nuptials looming, Clark thought it was time to reveal his dual identity to the love of his life, in this landmark issue by writer Roger Stern and artist Bob McLeod."</ref>

DC Comics had planned on Lois and Clark being married in 1993's ''[[Superman vol. 2]]'' #75. With the then-upcoming television show ''[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'', DC decided they did not want to have the two married in the comics and not married on TV. Partially as a result of this, [[The Death of Superman|Superman was killed]] in ''Superman'' #75 instead, dying in Lois' arms after a [[battle royal]] with the monster [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]]. After a period of time, Superman returned to life, and both he and Lois resumed their relationship, though not without a few problems (such as a brief reappearance of Clark's former college girlfriend, the [[mermaid]] [[Lori Lemaris]]). Lois eventually decided to take an overseas assignment to assert her independence and not be dependent on Clark, who had begun to overprotect her. When Clark became convinced Lois was in danger, he and her father Sam allied to aid her secretly.

When Lois returned to Metropolis, she had been through several life-threatening exploits and was slightly amused when Clark informed her his powers had been depleted, and that he was her editor (due to [[Perry White]]'s cancer). Upon discovering Clark still had her wedding ring within a handkerchief, Lois warmly broke down, teasing Clark and finally agreeing to become his wife.

Lois and Clark were finally married in the comic book ''[[Superman: The Wedding Album]]'' (December 1996), which featured the work of nearly every living artist who had ever worked on Superman.<ref name="Manning275" /> The issue was published during the week of October 6, 1996, coinciding with an episode of the television series ''[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'', which featured the wedding of the two characters.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.kryptonsite.com/manyfaces-wedding.htm|title= The Many Faces Of...

Since their marriage, Clark and Lois continue to be one of the strongest relationships in comics. In 2006, the couple took the next step in adopting a newly arrived Kryptonian boy, who they named [[Chris Kent (comics)|Chris Kent]]. The boy is later discovered to be the son of [[Jor-El]]'s foe, [[General Zod]]. Although initially uneasy about raising a super-powered child, Lois has shown immense aptitude of being 'Mommy Lois.' Following a devastating battle with Zod, Chris sacrificed himself to seal the [[Phantom Zone]] rift, trapping himself inside with Zod's forces, leaving Lois without her son.

In the second issue of ''[[Final Crisis]]'', Lois and Perry are caught in an explosion triggered by [[Clayface]] destroying the ''[[Daily Planet]]'' and Lois is critically injured. In the third issue, it is revealed that only Clark's heat vision is keeping her heart beating. Clark is visited by a mysterious phantom who insists that he must depart Earth immediately if he is to save his wife's life. The story is continued in the [[Stereoscopy|3D]] tie-in comic ''Superman Beyond'', where [[Monitor (comics)|the female Monitor]] Zillo Valla stops time around Lois, allowing Superman to leave her side for a while, recruiting him and several of his multiversal doppelgangers in a mission to save the entire Multiverse, promising care for Lois. After defeating the dark Monitor Mandrakk, Superman brings back a distilled drop of The Bleed and administers it to Lois through a kiss, restoring her to full health. Lois is later seen in ''Final Crisis'' #6, one of the few still free humans.

After the events of ''[[Superman: New Krypton]]'' Superman must leave Earth for an undetermined amount of time swearing off his Earthly connections in the eyes of his fellow [[Kryptonian]]s to keep an eye on General Zod the New Kryptonian military commander, but he secretly tells Lois he still considers her his wife and will come back to her. In the issues of ''[[Action Comics]]'' Lois has reunited with [[Chris Kent (comics)|Christopher Kent]] who has aged to adulthood in the past months and became the new Metropolis hero [[Nightwing]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Greg Rucka|Rucka, Greg]]| penciller= Barrows, Eddy| inker= Jose, Ruy; Ferreira, Julio| story= The Sleepers Part I| title= Action Comics| issue= #875| date= May 2009}}</ref> Supergirl and Lana visit Lois' apartment to tell her the bad news that her sister [[Lucy Lane]] was killed during a battle with [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]].

Lois hands her exposé in and the government is after her for treason. With agents on her tail, she makes a mad dash for it. When Lois is in custody, her father Sam Lane is there to greet her in an interview room in an unnamed facility. Sam tells Lois the only reason he has been lenient with her is because she is his daughter, while he does love her the planet will always come first over his family and threatens to make her disappear forever if she continues. Lois returns to the ''Daily Planet'' under cover of night and explains all to Perry. She points out the whole paper is at risk and everyone connected to it if her exposé runs. Perry understands and though he must protect the paper he is first and foremost a good journalist and nudges Lois in the right direction; he won't run the story but noted it must get out to the people somehow.

In ''[[Superman: Grounded]]'', Superman begins a journey through America to reconnect with the American people, and Lois, though confused at first, supports his choice.

Lois is the main character in the ''Superman: Lois Lane'' #1 one-shot. In this story, Lois' sister, Lucy, asks for her help in finding her roommate Amanda Suresh, who had been kidnapped by a mysterious group called "the Cartel." According to Lucy, Amanda had been taking a drug that transformed her into a monster. As Lois investigates the Cartel, she gets captured and taken to the Cartel's headquarters. There, Lois finds out the Cartel had been capturing people who had been mutated by the drug. Lois escapes and rescues Amanda when the captured monsters cause a riot. As she returns home, Lois finds out Lucy had been taking the drug. As Lucy apologizes for putting all three in danger, Lois chooses to publish her story about the Cartel.<ref>{{cite comic| writer=[[Marguerite Bennett|Bennett, Marguerite]]|penciller= Lupacchino, Emanuela; Hetrick, Meghan; Guara, Ig; Neves, Diogenes|inker= Ortego, Guillermo; Hetrick, Meghan; Jose, Ruy; Deering, Marc|story= Nostalgia|title= Superman: Lois Lane|issue= #1|date= April 2014}}</ref>

Some time after this, an organisation led by the mysterious 'HODOR-ROOT' learn Superman's secret identity, prompting him to share that information with Lois. When HODOR-ROOT try to analyse Clark's new 'Super-Flare' power, Lois reveals his identity to the public in the hope of removing their blackmail card, but this forces Clark to go on the run, hunted by criminals and law enforcement as some apparent side-effect of his Super-Flare has depleted his powers. Superman eventually learns that his depleted powers are due to [[Vandal Savage]] infecting him with a form of radiation that inhibits his cells' ability to absorb solar radiation, subjecting himself to kryptonite as a form of chemotherapy. With his powers restored, Clark reconciles with Lois, accepting that she exposed his identity for good reasons.

In the ''[[The New 52: Futures End|New 52: Futures End]]'', set five years in the possible future of the New 52-verse.

Lois has become an anonymous author, publishing several critically acclaimed books under the alias name "Author X." While Clark continues his superhero duty, protecting cities and civilians quietly behind the scenes.<ref>{{Cite comic| writer=Jurgens, Dan|penciller=Weeks, Lee| Story=Arrival|Title=Superman: Lois and Clark|Issue=1|date= December 2015}}</ref> Their son, Jonathan, eventually began to develop superpowers of his own (similar to those of his father Superman) and learned the truth about his parents' true origin.

In ''The Final Days of Superman'', the pre-''Flashpoint'' Superman helps his ''New 52'' counterpart defeat a man who has become convinced that he is the 'true' Superman after exposure to some of Superman's excess energy. ''New 52''-Lois is present when 'her' Superman expires as recent energy exposures catch up with him, after he tells her his life story for posterity.

===DC Rebirth===
In June 2016, DC Comics relaunched its entire line of comic book titles with [[DC Rebirth]].

In ''[[All-Star Superman]]'', the 12-issue comic book series by [[Grant Morrison]] and [[Frank Quitely]], Lois becomes a [[Kryptonian]] Superwoman for 24 hours. In the story, Superman (who believed he was dying) revealed his secret identity to her and takes Lois to his [[Fortress of Solitude]] to spend her birthday. While at his Arctic sanctuary, he presents Lois with her birthday present, a formula called "Exo-Genes" created by Superman from his own [[DNA]], that allows Lois to have his powers for twenty-four hours.

In [[DC Rebirth]], the ''New 52'' Lois and Lana gained superpowers due to the solar energy explosion caused by the death of the New 52 Superman. This results in both Lois and Lana becoming Superwoman, with Lois possessing all of Superman's traditional powers, while Lana has the ability to absorb solar energy and release it in other forms. Lois later dies at the hands of a female [[Bizarro]], being overloaded with solar energy the same way Superman was killed.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://screenrant.com/superwoman-comic-lois-lane-superman-dead/|title= DC's New Superwoman Unlocks Secret of Superman's Death|first= Andrew|last= Dyce|date= August 11, 2016|website= Screen Rant|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20161006054537/http://screenrant.com/superwoman-comic-lois-lane-superman-dead/|archive-date= October 6, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Red Tornado===

Following the DC relaunch, the series ''[[Earth-Two#Reimagined: Earth 2 in The New 52|Earth 2]]'' debuted in 2012, set on the [[List of DC Multiverse worlds|parallel world]] of that name. It depicts a modern take on the Golden Age world, starring the [[Justice Society of America]] and superheroes of that period.

In ''Earth 2'', Lois Lane is married to [[Superman (Earth-Two)|Superman]]. When Clark's cousin [[Power Girl|Kara]] arrived on earth, she stayed with Clark's parents, before moving in and living with Clark and Lois. Lois considers Kara as her daughter and Kara calls Lois mom.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer= Bennett, Marguerite; [[Tom Taylor (writer)|Taylor, Tom]]|penciller= Smith, Andy; To, Marcus;|inker= Hanna, Scott |story = Collision |Title = Earth 2|Issue = #27|date = December 2014}}</ref> Five years prior to the start of the story, during the first [[Apokolips|Apokoliptian]] invasion of Earth 2, Lois was killed by one of [[Darkseid]]'s assassins at the Daily Planet, she died in her husband's arms.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = [[Paul Levitz|Levitz, Paul]]| Penciller= Dougherty, Jed|inker= Dougherty, Jed|Title = [[Worlds' Finest]]|Issue = #32|date = May 2015}}</ref> Superman and many other heroes of Earth 2 perished in the war.

Five years later, as various heroes begin to rise and various gods from Apokolips begin to wreak havoc again. Lois' consciousness is revealed to have survived and was downloaded into the robot body of [[Red Tornado (identity)|Red Tornado]] by her father [[Sam Lane (comics)#Earth 2|Sam Lane]] and [[Robotman (Robert Crane)#Earth 2|Robert Crane]].<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Taylor, Tom|penciller= [[Nicola Scott|Scott, Nicola]]|inker= Scott, Trevor | Story = The Dark Age Begins! |Title = Earth 2|Issue = #17|date = January 2014}}</ref> Lois, now as Red Tornado, possessed the power of wind manipulation and cyclone generation abilities. Lois bands together with Green Lantern (Alan Scott), Batman (Thomas Wayne), Accountable (Jimmy Olsen) and the other gathered heroes to fight against the forces of Apokolips. After a protracted battle with what was thought to be a surviving brainwashed Superman, Lois realizes he is, in fact, a [[Bizarro]], and takes advantage of his deteriorating form to disintegrate him with a cyclone blast.<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = Taylor, Tom|penciller= Scott, Nicola|inker= Scott, Trevor |Story= The Kryptonian, Part Six |Title = Earth 2|Issue = #26|date = October 2014}}</ref> In the story, Lois is referred to by [[Doctor Fate]] as the "Resurrection hope".

During Superman's rampage and destruction on Earth 2, Lois is among a group that discovers Val-Zod, a Kryptonian, hidden in a cell beneath Arkham.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Taylor, Tom||Penciller=Scott, Nicola|inker= Scott, Trevor; Alvert, Oclair|Story=The Dark Age, Part 3 |Title = Earth 2|Issue = #19|date = March 2014}}</ref> Lois helps Val feel accepted and welcomed on Earth 2, learn to control his superpower, and overcome his [[agoraphobia]] (due to his prolonged travel in space to Earth).<ref>{{Cite comic|writer= Taylor, Tom|penciller= Scott, Nicola|inker= Scott, Trevor | Story= The Kryptonian, Part Two |Title = Earth 2|Issue = #22|date = June 2014}}</ref> Val-Zod eventually becomes the new Superman of Earth 2.

In the second Apokoliptian invasion of Earth 2, Lois and Kara are reunited, after Kara and [[Huntress (Helena Wayne)|Huntress]] return to Earth 2 from Prime Earth.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Bennett, Marguerite; Johnson, Mike; Wilson, Daniel |Penciller= [[Eddy Barrows|Barrows, Eddy]]; Jimenez, Jorge; Siqueira, Paulo; [[Ardian Syaf|Syaf, Ardian]]|inker= Ferreira, Eber; Hope, Sandra; Jimenez, Jorge; Miki, Danny; [[Cam Smith|Smith, Cam]]| Story= Apokolips Now |Title = Earth 2: World's End|Issue = #1|date = December 2014}}</ref> Lois, along with Kara, Val, Huntress, Batman and other heroes, fights against the armies of Apokolips and new villains appearing across Earth 2. While searching for Huntress beneath the fire pits of Earth 2 in DeSaad's cloning facility, Lois, Val, Kara and Batman found the real Superman who has been held captive for five years. He was revived by [[Desaad|DeSaad]] and was used as the genetic source for the Kryptonian clones.

In the final days of Earth 2, Lois' instincts as a journalist lead her to attempt to preserve and record the history and stories of Earth 2 in her large memory bank in the hope that someday, someone will read the data and rebuild this world.<ref>{{Cite comic| writer= Levitz, Paul|penciller= Dougherty, Jed|inker= Hanna, Scott| Story= The Secret History of Superman & Batman Part One|Title= Worlds' Finest|Issue= 27|date= December 2014}}</ref> After the destruction of Earth 2, Lois and the remaining civilians and heroes of Earth 2 relocated to a new world.<ref>{{Cite comic| writer= [[Daniel H.

The writer of ''Earth 2'', [[Tom Taylor (writer)|Tom Taylor]], specifically resurrected Lois Lane on Earth 2 after he was told to kill off the character in the ''Injustice'' comic series. Taylor stated "bringing Lois in was quite a personal thing, because having to do such horrible, horrible things to her in Injustice, the first thing I asked when I got on the book was if I could bring back Lois. Then it was just a matter of working out exactly how."<ref>{{cite web|last= Santori-Griffith|first= Matt|url= http://www.comicosity.com/interview-tom-taylor-batman-earth-2/ | title = Tom Taylor Talks Batman and the Cast of ''Earth 2''|publisher= Comicosity|date= February 5, 2014|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150818072758/http://www.comicosity.com/interview-tom-taylor-batman-earth-2/|archive-date= August 18, 2015|url-status=live| access-date= December 1, 2014}}</ref> Taylor received "[[Women in Refrigerators]]" criticism for his ''Injustice'' comic stories. Bringing back Lois as Red Tornado was Taylor's way to "unfridge" Lois. As Taylor noted, in Lois' first appearance as Red Tornado, Lois literally came out of a blue refrigerator. Other reasons for bringing back Lois involve Superman, Taylor commented "While evil bastard Superman is out there killing and maiming and destroying, I wanted Lois to exist as the counterpoint to this. She's the beating heart at the center. She's the good Ying to Superman's evil Yang. Where there's Lois, there's hope."<ref>{{cite news |last=Roger |first=Vaneta |url = http://www.newsarama.com/19662-unfridging-lois-just-one-of-the-surprises-tom-taylor-plans-for-dc-s-earth-2.html|title= 'Unfridging Lois' Just One of the Surprises Tom Taylor Plans For DC's ''Earth 2''|work= Newsarama|date= November 22, 2013|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150722034314/http://www.newsarama.com/19662-unfridging-lois-just-one-of-the-surprises-tom-taylor-plans-for-dc-s-earth-2.html|archive-date= July 22, 2015|url-status=live| access-date=December 1, 2014}}</ref>

[[Nicola Scott]], the long-time artist on Earth 2, on drawing Red Tornado Lois, "I wanted Lois to be Lois, despite the fact that she's metal.

==Earth-Two version==
[[File:Action Comics 484.jpg|thumb|The Earth-Two Lois Lane and Superman, from the cover of ''Action Comics'' #484 (June 1978), art by [[José Luis García-López]] and [[Dick Giordano]].]]

DC Comics instituted its [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|multiverse]] system in the early 1960s for organizing its continuity and introduced the [[Superman (Earth-Two)|Earth-Two Superman]] in ''[[Justice League of America]]'' #73 (August 1969).<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Dennis O'Neil|O'Neil, Dennis]]| penciller= [[Dick Dillin|Dillin, Dick]]| inker= [[Sid Greene|Greene, Sid]]| story= Star Light, Star Bright—Death Star I See Tonight!| title= [[Justice League of America]]| issue= #73| date= August 1969}}</ref> This [[retcon]] declared the Golden Age Superman and Lois Lane stories (i.e. comics published from 1938 through the early 1950s) as having taken place on the parallel world of "[[Earth-Two]]" versus the then mainstream ([[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]]) universe of "Earth-One".

In ''Action Comics'' #484 (June 1978), a flashback story reveals Earth-Two's Lois became infatuated with Clark Kent after the latter lost his memory of his superheroic identity (thanks to a spell cast by the old [[Justice Society of America]] enemy [[Wizard (DC Comics)|Wizard]] working for [[Colonel Future]]), with the result of Clark acting more aggressive and extroverted. Clark and Lois began to date each other and were soon married. During the honeymoon, Lois discovered that Clark was indeed Superman. After recruiting the aid of Wizard, Lois restored Clark's memory and Wizard surrendered to the authorities.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Cary Bates|Bates, Cary]]| penciller= [[Curt Swan|Swan, Curt]] | inker= [[Joe Giella|Giella, Joe]]| story= Superman Takes a Wife| title= Action Comics| issue= #484| date= June 1978}}</ref>

The now-married Lois and Clark appeared in a series of stories in ''[[The Superman Family]]'' #195–199 and #201–222 titled ''Mr and Mrs Superman'', which presented their further adventures early in their marriage. Susie Tompkins made a return as a recurring character.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[E. Nelson Bridwell|Bridwell, E. Nelson]]| penciller= Schaffenberger, Kurt| inker= Giella, Joe| story= Susie's Flying Saucer| title= Superman Family| issue= 199| date= January–February 1980}}</ref> Years later, Lois and Clark acted as parental figures for [[Power Girl]], Superman's cousin, after she arrived on Earth.

During the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' miniseries, the Earth-Two Lois Lane was seemingly seen for the final time, as Lois, the Earth-Two Superman, and the [[Superboy Prime|Superboy of Earth-Prime]] are, at the end of the story, taken by [[Earth-Three]]'s [[Alexander Luthor Jr.]] into a paradise-like dimension. Following the events of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths,'' this version of Lois was retroactively removed from DC's continuity.

In 2005's ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' miniseries, it was revealed that the Earth-Two Lois Lane Kent, along with Superboy, Alexander Luthor Jr., and Superman, have been watching the events of the post-Crisis [[DC Universe]] from their pocket dimension. Out of the four observers, she is the only one who still believes that the new universe is just going through a rough patch; Superboy-Prime and Alexander Luthor Jr. are convinced that Earth is utterly corrupt, and Kal-L is slowly becoming swayed to their way of thinking.<ref>''Infinite Crisis Secret Files'' #1. DC Comics.</ref> This version of Lois is frail, and dying for reasons not explicitly revealed, though possibly connected to her [[octogenarian]] status. This was the main reason for Kal-L's determination to restore Earth-Two, as he believed that Lois' health would recover once back on her proper Earth.<ref>''Infinite Crisis'' #1. DC Comics.</ref> Despite the restoration of Earth-Two, Lois Lane Kent died in the arms of her husband Superman regardless of Kal-L's protests that he could not let her die.<ref>''Infinite Crisis'' #5. DC Comics.</ref> After Kal-L died at the hands of Superboy-Prime, he commented that he finally understood Lois' final words "It's... not... going..." as meaning that it would never end for them, and one day it would be understood that even the heroes who had been lost in the original Crisis were still out there somewhere. After his demise, they are shown reunited in the stars, while their bodies are buried on Earth alongside [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Kon-El]]'s, who gave his life to stop Superboy-Prime's attempts to restore his Earth.<ref>''Infinite Crisis'' #7. DC Comics.</ref>

Lois later returns as a sinister [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lantern]] with her husband in the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' crossover. Her first task is to kidnap [[Jonathan and Martha Kent|Martha Kent]] with her spouse, and stating that she and Kal-L wish for [[Superman|Kal-El]], [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Connor Kent]], and Martha, to be reunited with [[Jonathan "Pa" Kent|Jonathan Kent]] in death. She proved unable to deal with the resourcefulness of Martha Kent, and was set ablaze by the widow, but kept regenerating until [[Krypto]] intervened, ripping the black ring out of her hand and preventing regeneration for long enough to allow Superman and Conner Kent to destroy the Black Lantern powerhouses attacking [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]], and reaching town to aid others unhindered.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[James Robinson (writer)|Robinson, James]]| penciller= [[Eddy Barrows|Barrows, Eddy]]| inker=Jose, Ruy; [[Julio Ferreira|Ferreira, Julio]]| story= A Sleepy Little Town | title= Blackest Night: Superman| issue= #1| date= October 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Robinson, James| penciller= Barrows, Eddy| inker= Jose, Ruy; Ferreira, Julio| story= Psycho Piracy!| title= Blackest Night: Superman| issue= #2| date= November 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Robinson, James| penciller= Barrows, Eddy; Goldman, Allan| inker= Jose, Ruy; Ferreira, Eber| story= The Long Dark Knight| title= Blackest Night: Superman| issue= #3| date= December 2009}}</ref> Black Lantern Lois later appears to [[Power Girl]], claiming that she has escaped the ring's corrupting influence, and needs her help. This was just a ploy to get close enough to her husband's body, which was being held in the JSA headquarters after his black ring had been removed. Black Lantern Lois "sacrifices" herself by removing her ring and giving it to Kal-L, restoring him to full undead status, and causing her own body to become inert.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Robinson, James| penciller= Barrows, Eddy; Marz, Marcos| inker= Ferreira, Julio; Del Negro, Luciana; Jose, Ruy| story= Lost Souls| title= Blackest Night: JSA| issue= #1| date= February 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Robinson, James; [[Tony Bedard|Bedard, Tony]]| penciller= Barrows, Eddy; Marz, Marcos| inker= Ferreira, Julio; Ferreira, Eber; Del Negro, Luciana| story= Troubled Souls| title= Blackest Night: JSA| issue= #2| date= March 2010}}</ref>

==In other versions==
During the years 1942–1985 Editora Brasil-América and [[Editora Abril]] which published the [[Brazil]]ian versions of Superman comics, Lois Lane's name was translated to "Miriam Lane" and later to "Miriam Lois Lane." In [[Spanish language|Spanish]] speaking countries, her name was translated to "Luisa Lane" in comics, TV series and movies.

===Elseworlds imprint===
*''[[Superman: Speeding Bullets]]'', a 1993 [[Elseworlds]] story based on the concept of an amalgamation of Superman and [[Batman]]. Martha and [[Thomas Wayne]] discovered Baby Kal-El, adopt and named him Bruce. Bruce discovers his superpowers when his parents are killed and create the identity Batman to fight criminals in [[Gotham City]]. Lois relocates to Gotham City after Lex Luthor buys the ''Daily Planet'', and soon forms a relationship with Bruce Wayne, the owner of her new job at the ''Gotham Gazette''. She later convinces him to abandon the identity of Batman and adopt a more hopeful persona of Superman.
*''[[Superman: The Feral Man of Steel]]'', a 1994 Elseworlds special in ''Superman'' (vol. 2) Annual #6, based on [[Mowgli|The Jungle Book]] stories with elements from [[Tarzan]]. Raised by [[Wolf|wolves]] in 19th-century [[India]]n Jungle and is given the name K'L'L. Lois is an American girl who falls for K'L'L.
*In ''Superman: Kal'', Lady Loisse is the daughter of the late Lord Lane in the [[Middle Ages]]. She is held captive by Baron Luthor, who hopes to make her his bride. Lois falls for Kal, a blacksmith's apprentice after he wins a contest against Luthor's best fighters. She accepts his request for her hand in marriage, as payment for him forging a suit of armour for Luthor from his rocket. After their wedding, Loisse is taken from Kal by Luthor, who subsequently killed her.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Dave Gibbons|Gibbons, Dave]]| penciller= [[José Luis García-López|García-López, José Luis]]| inker= García-López, José Luis| story= Superman: Kal| title= Superman: Kal| issue= #1| date= 1995}}</ref>
*Lois is a teacher from the undercity in the 1996 series, ''[[Superman's Metropolis]]'', modelled on [[Fritz Lang]]'s classic 1927 science-fiction film ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]''.
*''[[Superman: War of the Worlds]]'', a Superman story adapted into the [[H. G. Wells]] novel ''[[The War of the Worlds]]''. Set in 1938, after applying for a job at the [[Daily Star (DC Comics)|Daily Star]], Clark and Lois witness the arrival of the [[Martian]] invasion of Earth. Superman dies saving the Earth, and Lois marries Lex Luthor who becomes the [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]].
* In the 1998 series, ''[[JLA: The Nail]]'', the Kents never found Clark, Lois is selected by [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]] to provide the Justice League with some positive media presentation after a recent propaganda campaign focuses on the idea that many modern metahumans are alien invaders. Tracking recent kidnapped heroes to a secret base, Lois is introduced to the Kents, who provide a safe house for various heroes after Lana Lang smuggled them out of the facility, and later discovers that the true mastermind behind the conspiracy is [[Jimmy Olsen]], mutated into a Kryptonian through genetic experiments carried out based on DNA samples found in Kal-El's crashed and abandoned ship. Jimmy is finally defeated by Kal-El, who was here raised by an Amish couple until their deaths at Olsen's hands, with Lois writing about how Kal-El's time with the Kents helped him accept his abilities and grow into the Superman he should have been.
