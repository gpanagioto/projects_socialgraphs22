'''Hero Hotline''' is a fictional [[DC Comics]] corporate superteam introduced in ''[[Action Comics|Action Comics Weekly]]'' #637 (cover-dated January 1989). It was created by [[Bob Rozakis]] and [[Stephen DeStefano]].

==History==
Hero Hotline is a corporate 24/7 hero for hire company created by the Coordinator, a man who was secretly World War II hero Harry "Tex" Thompson the [[Tex Thompson|Americommando]]. The Coordinator only communicates with the agency as a shadowy figure on a communication screen. Their hotline number is '''1-800-555-HERO'''. They regularly take on the smaller missions from the common man; on occasion they have to fight the odd supervillain.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Markstein |first1=Don |website=Don Markstein's Toonopedia |accessdate=2 April 2020  |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/hotline.htm |title=Hero Hotline}}</ref>

Years after their own series ended, Hero Hotline was revealed to still be active in ''[[Teen Titans]]'' Annual #1 (March 2006), mentioned in passing as being among the heroes aiding in the evacuation of [[Bl√ºdhaven]] during ''Infinite Crisis''.

The member 'Private Eyes' is seen in the realm of Limbo, participating in a multi-hero battle against the forces of a cosmic vampire.<ref>''Final Crisis Superman Beyond 3D'' #1-2 (October 2008)</ref>
