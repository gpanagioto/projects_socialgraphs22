Small organisms live much faster lives and do things at a much faster rate. Hr! Soon they'll discover frozen food. Goh-ho. Uh-uh huh. Me?? Aw, man! I don't wanna be a god.

Maybe they wanna kill us. Arr! Rrrh. Nobody is going to tell us. This is going to drive me insane! I'm a what?? Harrr! 
Don't you see what this means? All our favorite movies are going to be changed, and updated, until we can't even recognize them anymore. NO! Nono, ah I don't wanna form a club! That's too much pressure! Look, ah-I'm supposed to take it easy; just, watch the clouds, sit on the grass. And, if we form a club there'll be responsibilites. Commitments! I'm not! I'm not a team player!  D'oh-ho! Oh Jesus! But we don't ''have'' hats! Aahh! You see?? First we were just forming a club, now we have to make hats! When does it end?? Fifty hats? Oh Jesus!  Ah!

I only slept for an hour, ...and then I ''dreamt'' about making hats, but I only made fifteen! A thousand?  Oh Jesus man! I don't have nearly a thousand hats! Goohoo!  Oh God! I gotta move away, you guys! Oh! Jesus! Don't tell them it was me! You don't? What?  You guys! You guys! Oh God! Um, I've got terrible news! Ted Koppel wants us to appear on ''Nightline'' to talk about our cause. No it isn't, man! Thahat's ''waaay'' too much pressure! Ga-ahah! Gaaarh!  Oh, Jesus, man! ...N'ahah! Ahah. U-uh. It's easy?

I'm not breaking into George Lucas's house. I'm not breaking into George Lucas's house. I'm in a green field. I'm in a field... surrounded by deer. Huh uh. Guh huh huh!  Oh God! Oh Jesus!  Aaaaaah! Oh God, no! Not Plan B!   Aaaahh!  Members, uuhh, oh Jesus, uh, we have to do something! Our club president  have all been taken hostage by Steven Spielberg! Haaa!  Yes, just like Hat!! No! Listen to me! We're not talking about Hat right now, okay?! Gad!! Look, we went to George Lucas's house a-and tried to melt his icy heart with a warm island song, but then Spielberg showed up and took three of our members prisoner! They're goin' to premiere their new ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'', and we ''have to'' rescue them! Do you understand?! No! Oh God. I'm gonna have to do this myself. Oh God! Hello! I'm gonna blow up the print, Spielberg!   That depends on how reasonable we're all willing to be. All I want are my friends. Except for Cartman - you can keep him. Then your premiere has no movie! Ah, what?! Oh my God! But what about the original prints of ''Raiders of the Lost Ark''? What if somebody else takes them and tries to change them? 
Cartman likes to play with dolls?  You... guys wanted me to meet you here?  Oh God. 
Oh God!  Agh! God, change it!!   Aaaah!! Gahahghah! Oh God. They're gonna get me.  I s-I saw! Uuuh!  Oh God! Huh!  Oh Jesus! Huh! No, ...NO! They're gonna get me!  ...Inside my room? Oh God!  AAAHH!  What?  Oh God! Oh Jesus!  Wait, that's not the usual ticket-taker guy! So? I don't know him! You relax! What if he wants to kill me?! AAAAAAAA!!   AAH! Uh... Get away from meee!  I don't know you!  Ah, AAAH! Huh uh! I'm not supposed to talk to you! But it could be a trick!  Ugh. That's a pretty good trick. AaaaAAAHH!   The Ghost of Human Kindness? What do you want? Huh-uh, how can I help it? It seems that everywhere I turn, someone is out to get me. It isn't? I think so. You mean that, even though all the news is about murderers and abductors, those kind of people... only make up a very small part of the world. I'll... try. Your van?  What the hell is going on? No. I didn't mean to. Triben fak burushban. 
Conifer? Walking there would take hours! Me too. 
Oh, Jesus, now what are we gonna do?! 
Mine too! Aaaa!  
No! Don't do it! Hguh. Then how come you couldn't do it? 
Eagh! This has been the longest week of my life! 
You did it! 
I caught my parents over at Bebe's house watching Sunsets of Homicide. But Bebe got the lock from the cable company! 
They're not better, they're just more expensive. 
Oh man, you're a lucky guy. 
What?  What is going on, huh? Huh? Me and him aren't together. Why is this happening?! Everyone thinks I'm gay! What if my parents find out! Huh! I'm not either! What's that? Gah! NO! Craig, can I touch your penis? No. Oh God.  AAaaagh! You're the one with the fuckin' problem!  You'd better not fuckin' push me again, man! No, no! What are you doing here?  There's no stopping it! The whole world wants me to be something I'm not! What?? What?! Are you insane?! The way everyone-! Like acting? No man, that is way too much pressure! I'll fail- Agh. I'm a terrible actor. Oh gah-okay. Oh God! What? Why not?  We don't belong together? What suddenly changed, Craig? Uh huh. And who the hell is Michael?! Huh?! You wanna tell me that?!  I went through your phone when we went out last night, Craig! I saw your texts to Michael about hooking up with him! Oh, it's not? Oh, don't use that lame shit on me, man! You don't wanna feel bad, so you try and tell me what I want?  Noho, you're not the bad guy! You're never the bad guy, are you?! You, you just step on people and you use them! Agh-I'm going too far?! What is wrong with you? Well, guess what, Craig! Love doesn't follow a plan!  Hi, is Craig here, sir? Hey, dude. I thought when we broke up everything would get better. I was thinking maybe we should say we're back together. What does that have to do with anything? You said to make it seem real. I'm so sorry, Craig. You, you made me believe in myself in a way I never have before. I didn't think I had any of that in me, but... you were right. I can do more than I think. You... changed something in me and I just... I wanna fix whatever's hurting you now.  Alright Craig. Alright.  
We're all gonna die! They have nuclear missiles! Wuh! Waaaa! Why are you just sitting there, doing nothing?!  AAAH!  AAAH! I can't settle down! We're all gonna die!  Oh God! The President tweeted that North Korea doesn't have the guts to attack us! Why would he say that?! He's making everything worse! But North Koreans are gonna think we all agree with the President! ...That won't help anything! North Korea wants us dead! I can't write in Korean and they all think we're war-hungry anyway! Errrrg! Send something, like what? I don't know how to make croissants! Uunnggc,  cupcakes? Okay.  Huh? Oh.  Oh, ahhh.  D"AAAAH! WHAT?? WHY WOULD HE SAY THAT?! The President! He tweeted about me! Why would he do that?! Did you see that?! Wwwhat? ...A fidget spinner?? Did you read what the President tweeted??   AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! AAH!  Greeaat.  What is that??  D'aahaahaah! Oh my God! Oh my God! Why is this happening to me?! They have to know that this isn't my fault! Whaaat?! Why would he say that?! Oh my God! What is he doing?! Why won't he just stop? Why?! Why does he keep making it worse?! WAAAAH!  Look at what the President tweeted now! Just read it!  They're gonna get me, Craig! Look at what's on CNN!  Waaaah! What am I gonna do?! How am I supposed to calm down?! North Korea is gonna get me! They're gonna get me! But Craig, I- Ugh! What are we doing here, Craig?!  The Ferris wheel!!  Oh God! Another tweet from the President! "Why would the U.S. be scared of North Korea? Tweek is so not scared he's at an amusement park in Denver right now."  JESUS CHRIST, WE'VE GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE!!  Oh my God, what is that? What is that?! Will you please stop saying that?! I can't take it! Well, maybe I don't wanna feel better right now! Why do you have to be so logical?! I don't need you to problem-solve all the time, I need you to... Augh, I don't know! You haven't been dealing with it, you've been trying to make it go away because my emotions are freaking you out!  There you go again! Stop preaching facts to me! It's not what I need! What? What do you mean, what's going on?! The same shit that's been going on! I feel scared! I feel alone! It is!  It's terrible! Like, like I have no control over my life. Like I'm just a pawn in a big game. Yeah, like trapped, but like, completely unable to even move. I don't know, it's... it's like... maybe, maybe I have to find a way to feel a little in charge of me again. I don't know, but I I've gotta do something about this. There's gotta be a way I can...  I've got it. People aren't focused on the right thing. I know what I should do. 
This franchise plan sucks! Yeah! 
  Kyle! Kyle! Don't do this, man! You can't mess with this shit while You Know Who is in office! We're all gonna die! 
Aaaagh! It's the President! Gaaahhh! [rides away quickly] I saw what I saw, Craig! You have to believe me! It was real! He tried to get me! The President! [Stan looks away, as if Tweek's statement hit close to home] We're all going to be missing soon! Nyaaarg! Do we really need music? 
I just feel that Craig has changed so much lately! He barely even talks to me anymore!
