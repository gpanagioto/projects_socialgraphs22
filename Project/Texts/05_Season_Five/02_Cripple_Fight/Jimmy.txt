Wow, what a great audience.  How about Jimmy Stewart? "Merry Christmas, movie house." And John Travolta. "Oh my God, Mr. Kotter! Mr. Kotter, oh, oh my God, Mr. Kotter!" Gee, sure, that'd be great! Thanks, fellas. See ya tomorrow at the bake sale, fellas. Wow, what a great audience. I just flew into South Park. Boy, are my crutches tired!  Well, I sure have met a lot of interesting people here in South Park.  And how about that school counselor? "Uh, dr-, drugs are b-bad."  Wow, looks like when it comes to comedy, I really t-take the c-keh-c. I really take the cay. I really take the k-keh cake.  Oh, hey Timmy. I'm glad you called, very much. I've been detecting some a-animosity towards me lately, and I was hoping we could bury the hatchet. What's that? A present? You got me a p-present? ... You-you didn't have to do that, Tim-Tim. Oh, sure. I'll see if it fits.   Thanks again, Tim-Tim. And so I said to him, "Hey, I- I may be handicapped, bu-but I'm not... deaf."  Wow, what a terrific audience. Well, for my next joke I'm gonna need a vo-volunteer from the audience, very much. How about you, Timmy? Sure, come on up here, Tim-Tim.  Hey, don't push me! Well then that settles it! Fellas, what we're gonna hafta do is try to ch... change the Scouts' rules, very much.  Timmy, when I tell you to do something, you do it! Timmy, don't make me k... kick you ass! Put on the hat! Pu-put it on!! Not this year. Come on. Come on! Come on!  Uh.  Huah!  Come on! No!  Ow! Timmy? Timmy?  Well, Timmy, I guess we learned an important lesson, too, very much. There ''is'' room for more than one handi-capable person in Scouts. I'm glad we're best friends now. See ya at Scouts.  Yes? Out of Scouts?  What?  Hey wait a minute! This is crazy! You can't do this! No! No!
