Once again, we have just learned that the ''Family Guy'' episode featuring Mohammad was only Part 1 of a two-parter! And Part 2 is going to air next week, with Mohammad uncensored! FOX Studios claims that the ''Family Guy'' writing staff has demanded the Mohammad character be seen in full view.  The head of FOX had this to say: Once again, bitter riots have started in the Middle East; this time, even more massive. And terrorist leader al-Zawahri has issued a threat. The idea has swept the nation! But where will we find enough sand for everyone?
