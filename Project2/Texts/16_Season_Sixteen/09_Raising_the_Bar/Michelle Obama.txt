Our country is in the midst of an epidemic. Recently a very big conflict was brought to my attention.  Let's do this!  Something's wrong. This... This is all wrong!  Stop! Everyone! What are we doing?! How can you let this happen to your daughter?! We need to realize obesity is an epidemic. But it's not a disease. From now on I'm going to dedicate this administration to FIGHTING childhood obesity!
