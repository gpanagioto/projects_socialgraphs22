Talk about appropriate ways we can talk in the workplace. Can I, can I get a volunteer to role-play with me? M'alright?  How about you, Mr. uh...  M'alright, come on up here.  Oh, Mr. Mackey. Good mornin'! Now, did you have a nice night? M'alright. Okay. Uh good luck today, and I hope that our workin' relationship can continue to be honest and straightforward. I can see that. You got very honest eyes, m'alright.  So, uh, Mr. Mackey, what methods do you use for counseling the students? Wow, you studied Solomon? He was actually my thesis in college. No! Same here!
