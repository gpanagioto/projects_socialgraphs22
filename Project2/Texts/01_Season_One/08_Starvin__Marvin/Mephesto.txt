Mayor, we've got a very big problem. Yes, and I may have made a horrible mistake. I was trying to genetically engineer turkeys for Thanksgiving. You know, to provide food for the needy. Well, something went wrong and the turkeys broke free. And the worst part is, they're REALLY pissed off. We have to stop them or, or they could destroy everything. Time is short. They act just like normal turkeys, except they're evil. Somehow I don't think you're taking me seriously. I knew that you were the only person who would listen to me Chef. Look here in my microscope; tell me what you see. Oh, whoops. Now tell me what you see. Precisely, but look how rapidly it's dividing. Means the turkeys are growing at an exponential rate. If we don't destroy them all, they'll take over the town. Maybe the world. Sure. They're increasing in number mayor. These are the vicious turkeys I warned you about. We need ''more'' than that! They'll only come back in increased numbers! I tried to tell you, but you didn't listen. That's not important right now. My God, what have we done? But all those poor turkeys, theh- they're all dead. As horrible as they were theh- they felt like a part of me. Perhaps I shouldn't be toying with God's creations, perhaps I should-
