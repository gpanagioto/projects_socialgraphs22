 We're here! It's the water park!  We got it, Dad. Well Cartman said he wanted to do the wave pool first, right Cartman? Dude, this is awesome. Okay. Come on Kyle, let's check out the fireboats. Aw come on, look at all this water. It doesn't matter if one person pees in it. Yeah, they do, Kyle. Come on, show us how long you can hold your breath. After this, you guys wanna hit the hurricane slides? Aw come on, Kyle. Not everybody pees in pools. Not today... yet. Well dude, what are you gonna do? Just hang out here at the table all day? Dude, where have you been? This is more math than I've ever seen you do. I'm gonna go on the slides. This is sweet, huh Kenny?   OH MY GOD, THEY KILLED KENNY!  Kyle, quick! You've gotta swim over to us! Well if you don't swim in it you're gonna die! Kyle, it's just pee! It's not that big a deal!  ...Well, not everyone washes their hands after they go to the bathroom. Come on, dude, you've gotta swim. Not... all the time. Why? It's not like you're peeing on your hands! There's more germs on most furniture than there is in pee! Kyle, come on! I don't know.  Who are you? ...Well, it's not like if you suddenly have to pee, you're gonna get ''out'' of the shower. That's true dude, didn't you see ''The Abyss''? Just drink the pee, Kyle. Come on, dude! All right, they finally came for us.  Aw come on. It was just a little pee, Kyle.
