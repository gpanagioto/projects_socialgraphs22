My bakery has seen a 20% increase in sales. Oh, I just love all these city people moving in! Here's to the future, everyone! We can't let that happen. Not when things are finally starting to turn around! Yes! We are to tell the realtors to cool their jets! You're driving all the city people away! Where is South Park Realty Group located?! There's a big one and a little, fat one! We did it! We fucking did it!
