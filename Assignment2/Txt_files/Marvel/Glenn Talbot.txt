[[Major (United States)|Major]] (later [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]]) '''Glenn Talbot''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]], he first appeared in ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'' #61 (November 1964).<ref>{{Cite book |last=DeFalco |first=Tom |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=368}}</ref>

He is a close compatriot to General [[Thunderbolt Ross|Thaddeus Ross]] and an active participant in his operations to capture or kill the [[Hulk]]. His most significant blow is discovering and informing his superiors that Doctor Bruce Banner physically transformed into the Hulk, which made the scientist a wanted fugitive. Talbot is consistently portrayed as a courageous, resourceful, and fiercely patriotic man who puts the good of his country before all else. He is romantically attracted to [[Betty Ross]], who is in love with Bruce Banner, which adds fuel to his enmity for the Hulk. Though Talbot was mostly used as a romantic rival and general adversary for Banner, the two sometimes work together to battle greater menaces.

The character has appeared in various media adaptations, including novels, video games, animated films and TV series. In the 2003 film ''[[Hulk (film)|Hulk]]'', he was portrayed by [[Josh Lucas]], while [[Adrian Pasdar]] portrayed him in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] [[Television series#Seasons.2Fseries|television series]] ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.|Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' In the latter, he is an adversary and later begrudging ally to [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] before becoming the show's version of '''[[Graviton (comics)|Graviton]]'''.

==Publication history==
{{expand section|date=April 2014}}
Glenn Talbot was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]] in 1964 and first appeared in the [[Hulk]] feature of ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'' #61. He was a key character in the series' long-running [[story arc]] in which Bruce Banner/Hulk is suspected of being a communist traitor, and would remain a part of the Hulk's supporting cast long after ''Tales to Astonish'' had been renamed ''The Incredible Hulk''.

==Fictional character biography==
Glenn Talbot was a career military man. When [[Thunderbolt Ross|General Thaddeus "Thunderbolt" Ross]] contacts [[the Pentagon]] to request an investigation of civilian scientist [[Robert Bruce Banner]], Talbot is put in charge of reviewing whether or not such an investigation is merited. After two weeks studying records of Dr. Banner's career, Talbot concludes that Ross' suspicions that Banner is a traitor are well-founded, and reports this to the Pentagon. The Pentagon responds by appointing Talbot security chief for Gamma Base, where Ross is the commanding officer. While reporting for duty to General Ross, Talbot meets the General's daughter [[Betty Ross]], who is in love with Banner. He is immediately attracted to her and tries to court her without losing focus on his investigation of Banner. General Ross encourages this, as he objects to Betty's love for Banner all together, whether he was a traitor or not,  because he feels that Banner is too timid emotionally and physically. Ross believes that Talbot, a military man like himself, would be a much better suitor for his daughter.<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #61 (November 1964). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Talbot's suspicions of Banner are heightened when, upon Talbot's arrival at the base, the scientist mysteriously goes missing in the hills nearby.<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #62 (December 1964). Marvel Comics.</ref> Further suspicious circumstances follow, including Banner disappearing behind the [[Iron Curtain]] for a time, but proof that Banner is a traitor continues to elude Talbot.<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #63-68. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, when Banner disappears with the vital Absorbatron, orders are given to shoot him on sight, and the scientist is killed by a soldier.<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #69 (July 1965). Marvel Comics.</ref> Talbot is retained as the base's security chief, and he and Ross continue to pursue the Hulk until he, too, is seemingly killed by a barrage of nuclear weapons.<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #70-72. Marvel Comics.</ref> At Talbot's suggestion, the Hulk's frequent companion [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] is taken into custody in order to pressure him into revealing the connection between Banner and the Hulk. When Jones still refuses to talk, he is set free, and Talbot confronts him privately. Persuaded in part by the fact that the Hulk is seemingly dead, Jones confesses to Talbot that Banner and the Hulk were one and the same. Talbot realizes that Banner being the Hulk explains all his past suspicious behavior, and subsequently informs his superiors.<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #75-77. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Subsequently, the Hulk is found still alive, and is captured using a plan devised and orchestrated by Talbot. The creature is subsequently freed by the traitor Dr. Konrad Zaxon,<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #78 (April 1966). Marvel Comics.</ref> and Talbot twice fails to prevent Betty from being abducted by supervillains.<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #79-82. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, he redeems himself by facing down [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]], preventing the villain from stealing the army's new Orion Missile despite a shrapnel wound. He is awarded one of the nation's highest honors for his heroism on this occasion.<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #83-84. Marvel Comics.</ref> Despite this, he is unable to convince Betty to relinquish her feelings for Banner, and he continually hopes that the army will be forced to kill the Hulk, so that Betty will eventually forget him.<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #85-92. Marvel Comics.</ref> He finally succeeded and married Betty all the while attempting to keep her away from Banner and the Hulk.<ref>''Hulk'' #158 (December 1972). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Talbot is taken hostage by the [[Gremlin (comics)|Gremlin]],<ref>''Hulk'' #188 (June 1975). Marvel Comics.</ref> rescued some months later it was discovered that his captivity had left him catatonic. In order to unblock his mind, [[Doc Samson|Doctor Leonard Samson]] had the Hulk (who was Banner under control by a special helmet) unblock what was keeping him in a mindless state. The process was a success.<ref>''Hulk'' #200, 202. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, Talbot's marriage to Betty later became strained.<ref>''Hulk'' #213. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Yet he did take a leave from Gamma Base and soon divorced Betty, who later admitted to Rick Jones that she had never stopped loving Bruce Banner. Talbot continued battling the Hulk and tried to have Banner court-martialed. When General Ross had a breakdown, Talbot was promoted to Colonel. His life remained relatively uneventful until the Hulk stormed into Gamma Base, looking for his deceased love [[Jarella]], who was still cryogenically frozen. It was revealed Talbot had fired a ray gun that sent the Hulk to the [[Microverse|Sub-Atomic universe]]. This incident was the final straw in his already deteriorated relationship with Betty. Soon Congress cut funds from Gamma Base and Talbot decided once and for all to stop the Hulk by using the [[War Wagon (comics)|War Wagon]].<ref>''Hulk'' #256-260. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Glenn Talbot was killed fighting the Hulk in Japan while piloting the War Wagon prototype.<ref>The Incredible Hulk #260. Marvel Comics.</ref> Later, however, he was seen alive and well, in the company of Betty Ross; at the time, the circumstances of his apparent resurrection were not revealed.<ref>''Fall of the Hulks: Gamma'' (December 2009). Marvel Comics.</ref>

As the attempted ''[[coup d'Ã©tat]]'' of [[Washington, D.C.]] takes place, Colonel Talbot appears on national TV as part of the Intelligencia's plan to seize control - only to be revealed as an [[Life Model Decoy|L.M.D.]] himself when the [[Thunderbolt Ross|Red Hulk]] decapitates him.<ref>''Hulk'' (vol. 2) #23. Marvel Comics.</ref> This L.M.D. was so thoroughly reprogrammed that it believed itself to be the resurrected Glenn Talbot, complete with all of Talbot's memories including his love for Betty Ross. The real Talbot is presumed to have remained dead all this time.

During the ''[[Chaos War (comics)|Chaos War]]'' storyline, Glenn Talbot returned from the dead after what happened to the death realms.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #619. Marvel Comics.</ref> Although, Glenn Talbot and other dead heroes concluded returned to the grave after the [[Amatsu-Mikaboshi (comics)|Chaos King]] is defeated.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #620. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Family==
Since his "death" two of Talbot's relatives have also appeared. He has a younger brother named Brian Talbot who was a member of the [[Gamma Corps]] as Grey (who sports the DNA of Hulk and Leader). Trained in martial arts. The Leader DNA does not make Grey as smart as Prodigy but he has a brilliant military strategist and it seems to have been meant as a way to prevent him from losing control. Brian was often bullied and beaten by his older brother and had actually been delighted to hear of his death. He claimed he joined the Gamma Corps because the Hulk was dangerous but really it was to do what Glenn could not - destroy the Hulk.<ref>''World War Hulk: Gamma Corps'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Talbot also has a nephew named Matt Talbot, who is also a member of the military.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #436. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Other versions==
In the alternate reality depicted in the 2005 "[[House of M]]" storyline, Glenn Talbot is married to Betty Ross.<ref>''Hulk: Broken Worlds'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Talbot is portrayed as a colleague and friend to [[Thunderbolt Ross|General Ross]], and operates in the [[Baxter Building]]'s [[think tank]]. His full name is General Glenn M. Talbot.<ref>''[[Ultimate Fantastic Four]]'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In the 2012 miniseries ''Avengers: X-Sanction'', [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] initially mistakes [[Thunderbolt Ross|Red Hulk]] for a foe of his from the future named 'Talbot', suggesting that one of Talbot's relatives will become another [[Red Hulk]] at some future.<ref>''[[Avengers: X-Sanction]]'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> Future versions of Wolverine and Hulk (resembling [[Old Man Logan]] and [[Maestro (comics)|Maestro]] respectively) speak to the President of the United States who resembles a Red Hulk with Talbot's mustache.<ref>''[[A+X]]'' #1.

Talbot appears in the 2008 ''[[The Incredible Hulk (2008 video game)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' video game, voiced by Michael Gannon. This version views both Banner and the Hulk as threats to mankind.
