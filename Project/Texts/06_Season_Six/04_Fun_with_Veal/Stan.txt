Wait a minute. Veal is... little baby cows?? Yeah, I wouldn't have. Tomorrow morning?  Dude, we gotta help them.  Pst, Cartman.  Cartman, wake up! We're gonna go to save the little baby cows, fatass! So we can't let 'em die, douchebag! You're our friend; now come help us! We're sorry, you are our friend. We need you to help us because ''friends stick together''.  Damnit Butters, will you shut up?!  Yes we do. We're those little baby cows' only hope. Will you help us? Go on, dude it's the only way. Just do it really fast, and we can go. Okay, very funny Cartman, now come on! Yeah, well killing little helpless baby cows should be a crime, too!  How does this thing work, Cartman?  Okay, that's far enough. I'm going to go delta.  Go! They're gonna murder you. Come on, you stupid baby cows!  They aren't leaving. Oh yeah, they're too weak to move.  Well, we've gotta get 'em out of here. We'll just keep them at Butters' house until they can get their strength back. Okay, fine Butters! I guess you're not a team player! We'll bring them to my house. I don't know.  We won't have to. Butters said he had something in his house that makes baby cows strong again. He's bringing it over. Butters!  Did you bring it? What? Aw crap!  That asshole is gonna kill them and feed them to people! They don't belong to anybody! Please Mom, we don't want these calves to die. No! You're the ones who made me eat veal without telling me what it was! You're the ones who knew we were making little baby animals suffer!   Kiss my ass! I'm gonna lock myself in here with these cows until we have a guarantee of their safety, in writing.  Don't be so sure. Because I'm gonna tell you: this is gonna get ugly. Real ugly. When all is said and done you could all be looking at being grounded for three, perhaps even four weeks. So if any of you guys want out, just say the word now.  Shut up, Cartman. Then it's settled. One for all and all for one! Except Cartman. Be strong, Butters. You knew it would come to this. This isn't a game, Mom. We're not coming out until we know the calves will be safe.  Our parents would never let us starve. They're bluffing. This is a battle of wills. If we hold out long enough, they'll give in. Three of us can sleep while one keeps watch. We'll shift every couple of hours. We'll stay in this room with these baby cows for as long as it takes!  No, Cartman, we're not eating a calf! Wait, what is that?  Dude! See? Now we can hold out for weeks!  Dude, what are you guys doing? You're eating meat! What the hell do you guys think we're doing all this for?!  That's fine! You guys can live off of flesh, but I'm never eating meat again! No, this is exactly what we wanted. Yeah, don't you see? This validates everything that we're doing. If we're making the news, then this is obviously important to people.  ...I don't believe it.  What are ''they'' doing here? Aw, I just feel so rundown. I don't know what's wrong with me. I've got these sores.  No! Hello? Ah, hold on.  It's some negotiator named Mike. What do I do? What do I say?? Cartman, no! O-ogh...  It... did? Pick me up. I... I want to see.  We're sorry, cows. We tried. We tried! Well, I guess we learned something today: it's wrong to eat veal because the animals are so horribly mistreated, but if you don't eat meat at all you break out in vaginas.
