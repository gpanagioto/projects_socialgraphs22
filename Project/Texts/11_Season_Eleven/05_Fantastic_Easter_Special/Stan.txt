Uh, can I ask a question? Why do we do this? Right, so, why do we color eggs?  Yeah, but why? So we dip eggs in colored vinegar and a giant rabbit hides them? You don't see the missteps in logic with that?  Look, I'm just saying that somewhere between Jesus dying on the Cross and a giant bunny hiding eggs there seems to be a, a gap of information.  I don't feel like coloring eggs! I don't get it! All right, can you explain to me what's going on? What is the deal with the coloring the eggs and you hiding them and all that? What does that have to do with Jesus dying on the Cross?  Answer me! I know that! But I figure you must have some knowledge of what Easter's about if you're playing the Easter Bunny at the mall! No, I'm not gonna just go with it! I'm gonna find out what's behind all this!  Mom? Dad?  Anybody home? Dad! You've gotta help me!  Dad! There's Easter bunnies chasing me! They chased me from the mall! I don't know what they want!  Dad? Why were those other rabbit guys chasing me?!  Does Mom know about this? ''I'' don't understand! Could, could you, take off, the ears, please? So what is the secret of Easter? Grandpa's in it too? Dad, do I have to wear this bag over my head the entire time? You mean the old Galveston Lodge?  Must I? Hi Grandpa. ...Stan. Yeah. Yeah, I wanna know already. Where am I supposed to go? Jesus Christ!  Oh no...  Help. My Dad's in a rabbit-worshiping cult called the Hare Club For Men they protect the secret of Easter but before they said what it was they were attacked by ninjas and put me in charge of Snowball.  Do you know anything about Easter? What is the connection between Jesus and rabbits and colored eggs? Please? Do you know anything about the Hare Club For Men?   My Dad is in it. This... rabbit is too somehow. Just bread... He was the disciple that Jesus made into the first pope. He looks like a guy.  But why would Jesus want a rabbit to run his church? I don't get it. Why would the pope be holding my Dad hostage for Snowball? They found me! If the pope has my Dad... I have to give him what he wants. What choice do I have?! There's nobody left who can help us!  First, you have to promise you won't hurt it! And that you'll let everybody go! Okay, fine.  You said "hand over the bunny." Hey, what the hell! Jesus, you did answer my prayer!  No! No!  Snowball!  All right Jesus! Yeah. I've learned not to ask questions. Just dye the eggs and keep my mouth shut.
