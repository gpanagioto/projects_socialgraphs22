What's this?  A ticket? "Failure to care about the environment" Oh Goddammit, did you do this, Gerald?! You got some nerve, you know that?! Where do you come off ticketing people?! I know it's not a real ticket!! The problem, Gerald, is that ever since you got a hybrid car, you've gotten so smug that you love the smell of your own farts! And that too! Stop talking with your eyes closed! That's what smug people do! There, like that! Stop that! I know! It's like "Earth to America? Hello? This is simple stuff here. Gawl".  At least ''we're'' smart enough to know better! Are you trying to tell us the smug from our hybrids is actually gonna kill us all? Yeah. Good going, stupid! Hey, where do you think YOU're going?! Oh no you're not! Your gay little song got us to drive hybrids; you're gonna help us get rid of 'em! That's it. That's that the last one. I'm sorry, Stan. I'm sorry your gay little song killed your friend. Yeah. First off, we're all gonna need new cars. You mean... drive in hybrids... but not act like we're better than everyone else because of it. I'm...  I'm not ready... Perhaps... one day... we can learn to drive hybrids without being smug about it, but for now... the technology is just too much for us.
