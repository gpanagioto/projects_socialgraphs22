Now, finally, the shocking truth about Cartman's lineage... will not be seen tonight, so that we can bring you the following special presentation. Who is Eric Cartman's father? Find out on an all new ''South Park'', in just a few weeks. Who is Eric Cartman's father? At the end of this episode, you ''will know'' the answer. Who shot Mephesto? Was it the school counselor? Or was it Ms. Crabtree? Or was it-- Or was it Sheila Broflovski? Who will they kill next? Will it be Jimbo? Barbrady? The Denver Broncos? Who will the director cast first? Will it be Mr. Garrison? Officer Barbrady? Chef? Who framed Roger Rabbit? Was it Jimbo? Mr. Garrison? Chef? Who the hell made Jimbo boss? Was it Barbrady? Chef? Mr. Gar-- Who is screwing with the lights? Is it Barbrady? Or Jimbo? Or the 1991 Denver Broncos? Who built the pyramids? Was it the [[Babylonians]]? Officer Barbrady? [[Samaritans]]? Who is Eric Cartman's mother? Is it Mrs. Crabtree? Sheila Broflovski? The Mayor?  Now, get ready for Canada's hottest action stars, Terrance and Phillip in HBC's Movie of the Week: ''Not Without My Anus''. Based on a true story. Previously, on South Park: an air of sobriety fills the laboratory as the men of South Park gather to find out which one of them fathered this boy. Ladies and gentlemen, the case before you today is of a murderer. On the night in question, this monster entered the home of Dr. Jeffrey O'Dwyer and struck him repeatedly on the head with his hammer. That monster is sitting right over there, and his name is Terrance!  All of these things link Terrance to the murder: hair fibers, blood samples, nail clippings, a piece of his shirt, Terrance, you may be a famous surgeon, but you're not God. ''J'accuse'', Terrance. Your Honor, the defense is trying to make a mockery of this court! They think that farts are funny, but they're not!  Goddammit! That isn't funny!  Well, looks like you got away with it, Terrance and Phillip! There ''are'' hard feelings! This isn't over. I'm going ta see to it that you both pay for what you've done. And do you know why? No, Because I hate you. You think farting is so funny. Well, it isn't!! Fart jokes are the lowest form of comedy, and if I-- Ugh! I hate you both! I've hated you ever since I could remember! I hate you, and I wish you both had cancer. Yes. In the head. This is not the end, Terrance and Phillip! You'll rue this day!  Hello? Yess, yes it is. Yes. I'm a television critic for a magazine. Yes! Yes I do! They think that fart jokes are a sophisticated form of comedy, but they're not! Who is this?  Saddam Hussein? The Iraqi dictator? What do you want? I'm not sure I should trust you. Scott to Red Dragon, come in, Red Dragon. The plan is working perfectly. Terrance and Phillip have taken the bait. Yes. Everything's proceeding according to plan. Now you promised that when Terrance and Phillip arrive they'll be ripped into pieces and shot several times. Roger, Red Dragon. Scott out.  I've got you now, you fart-lovin' fart-lovers. Hey, Saddam. You helped me get rid of Terrance and Phillip, and I appreciate that, but why are framed pictures of you going up all over Canada? ...No I don't need a rest!! I want to know what this is all aboot. I thought you were from Iraq. Hey, what the hell are you guys doing here? You're not supposed to be here, you're supposed to be in Iran looking for your kidnapped-- Ah, I mean, how are you guys today? Nothing, why? What? Aargh! I hate you more than ever, Terrance and Phillip! I absolutely abhor you both! I'm wishing cancer upon you. That's right. I'm trying to give you cancer with my mind.  What's so funny! Saddam, Terrance and Phillip are back in Canada! You promised me they'd be gone for good! That was your part of the bargain! This deal's getting worse all the time. Terrance, this is Scott. Just shut up and listen. You've unleashed a monster onto Canada! And only you can get rid of him, even though I hate you, and I wish you had cancer. ''You're'' a dick. ''You're'' a dick. ''You're'' a dick.  ''You're'' a dick. The two of you are the most annoying dicks in Canada. You give other Canadians a bad name. And if I had my hair- Sure. You son of a bitch! I'll get you if it's the last thin-- Sure. Goddammit! Sure. I mean, no! You listen to me! If you want to save Canada, you'll meet me at Karl's Kroff Dinner Restaurant in half an hour.   What are you idiots doing? Is that some kind of metaphor for a kind of search that can't be described? Listen. I have an inside scoop. There's an Iraqi dictator who is quietly and slowly taking over Canada. Well, what are you two gonna do aboat it? It's your fault that he's here! You brought the Iraqis back with you on your plane when you rescued your kidnapped daughter!  That's right. And now you must make amends. Tomorrow, Saddam will try to finalize his takeover of Canada, at the Roughriders-Roughriders football game. It will be your only shot at wiping them all out. Here, take this. It's a bomb. You must strap it to yourselves, go to the game, and sacrifice your lives to take out Saddam's minions. Well, you must do it for Canada. Yes, Terrance and Phillip. And when the dust is settled, Canada will be rid of both: the Iraqis and your immature fart humor.  Hey, What the hell happened? You were supposed to be blown up! Oh! That is so juvenile! Of course! '''I hate you, Terrance and Phillip!!!'''  Oh, Terrance, You farted in court. Yes, please. The monkey claw is smelly. My sentiments exactly, Your Honor. I see from your actions that you're ''southern'' Canadian. Good people of the jury. My client, Terrance, is an innocent man.  I have, haven't I, Terrance? Good people of the jury. My client, Terrance, is no more a murderer than you or me. He loves puppies and hates mean things. Would a murderer go to the zoo and feed animals like this? Of course not. So in summation, find Terrance innocent. Or else he'll kill you. Just kidding. The defense rests. Did you hear that, Terrance? You're not guilty. Hear hear. Oh, hello, Scott. No hard feelings, right, old pal? 'Cause you're a dick? Cancer? Yes, perhaps he's homophobic. We're not?  Yes. It's been a long day, and only Kraft Dinner can calm my nerves. He sure does seem to hate us. I wonder what he'll try to do next. The subway certainly is wonderful, Terrance. Yes, let's look for treasure. Oh. Hello, Ugly Bob. Ugly Bob, your face looks like somebody tried to put out a forest fire with a screwdriver. Wait wait. I've got an idea. Why don't you put this paper bag over your head, Ugly Bob? Hello Barky. Hello Purry. Say Terrance, I was just aboot to make some Kraft Dinner. Would you like some? I'll take that. Ooh, Terrannce!  You got a letter! What is it, Terrance? Did you fart? Not Sally! Dear God, no, Terrance! Why Sally? God, why? Say, Terrance, who's Sally? I never know you had a daughter, Terrance. No, you never did, Terrance. My God, what a fascinating story, Terrance. Especially the part aboot Celine Dion. Then I'll go with you, Terrance. Well, you know what they say: A friend in need is a friend with Kroff Dinner. Hello, Ugly Bob. Dammit man!  Danger or no, I'm going to help my friend find his daughter!! Oh good. Well, I certainly am going to miss Canada, Terrance. Terrance, if I die whilst in Iran, please bring my body back to Canada, and bury me in a box with a side of Kroff Dinner. Burned your face. Oh, look. There she is. Say, she looks a lot more like Celine Dion than you, Terrance. Oh, now I see the resemblance! Oh, raspberries, looks like I'm losing a friend. Oh my God!  What is this?! Is this Canada? This is madness! I don't know, Terrance. And who is that smelly person in all these pictures? Oh my God, it's Ugly Bob!! Because that's his name, you stupid bitch! Behold his horrible face. Ohh, the humanity!! Yes. I agree whole-fartedly. Wait, what were you saying? What are you doing, Scott? Cancer?! Hey, don't give ''me'' cancer! Hey, Terrance, let's watch American television. Oh look. Here's a show.  Goddamn, their TV shows are lame! Look at their silly American heads. Yes it is, Terrance. According to that newsie, he's some kind of Turkish dictator. That fart sounded like a ringing phone, Terrance. Tell him he's a smelly bastard. Well, while we're waiting, why don't we search for treasure? No, we're searching for treasure. What do you mean? You mean, we are to blame?! What is this? For Canada, Terrance. Yes. This bomb will blow us both to smithereens. But we really have no choice. Only our deaths can bring Canada life. Hey! Wait a minute. That fart gives me pause. That smelly Saddam Hussein. He uses germ and chemical warfare, does he not? Terrance! Get the phone book! We must call every Canadian we can! I do, Terrance. Yes. Prepare the alert! Oh, Glorious Day!  Don't touch me, Ugly Bob! We came up with a better plan. You see, Scott, after all your criticism, it was farting that saved Canada. Say, Terrance? Will you check my ass for abnormalities? That's tomfoolery. Give it to me straight, Terrance. Oh, what a relief! Cancer? My ass is collapsing? Will this mean that I won't be able to fart anymore? What's happening here, Terrance? Who's the donor? Terrance, you're giving up your ass for me? All right, Terrance. Well, all right. Okay. God. Oh, you got me, Terrance!   Aaaaagh! That's right, Terrance. ''This'' is the season for ''sharing''.     Yes, Phillip. I'm making a case for our defense.  Would you like a monkey claw, Phillip? That's called the monkey claw because it feels like my colon is being ripped apart by a thousand monkeys. Oh, Phillip, now you farted during the closing argument. Oh, Phillip, you saved me from the gas chamber. That sure was fun, Phillip. Let's go home and eat Kraft Dinner. Head cancer? Wow, Scott really hates us, Phillip.  But we're not gay, Phillip. Well, let us board the subway and return home. There we can eat Kraft Dinner. Say, Phillip, why does Scott always try to convict me of murder? He does it every week. God only knows. It sure is. Let's look for treasure. Well. It's too bad we didn't find any treasure on the subway, Phillip. My God, you're looking hideously ugly today, Ugly Bob. Because you're God-damned ugly, Bob. No it isn't.  Wanna see what's on the inside of me? Yes. If people can't see your face, they won't know how wretchedly ugly you are. Sure you can, Ugly Bob. If they can't see how horribly disfigured you are, they'll want to sleep with you. You know I never turn down Kraft Dinner, Phillip. I'm going to put on a pirate costume.  Oh my God! No! It's Sally. She's being held captive in Iran. My daughter. Oh, yes. Didn't I mention that, me hearty? Oh. Well. It all began fifteen years ago. Yes, indeed.  And I will have to go and find her. You're such a good friend, Phillip. Avast there, mateys. Hello, Celine Dion. You're looking well. Celine, where is our daughter, Sally? Wrong. She's been taken hostage, and is now being held prisoner. Phillip and I are going to Iran to find her, but we may never return. We just grew apart, Celine Dion.  How's the paper bag working out? Terrific! We need two tickets for Tehran, please. In-deed, Phillip. Same here, Phillip! I Got Ya. Ow, that's rancid. Hahahahaha. Oh, Phillip. How will we ever find my fugitive daughter in this daunting place? We don't speak the language, we are unwelcome strangers, and we have no idea where to begin. Oh, good. I'm here, Sally. It's your father, Terrance. I'm here to save you from your smelly Arabian captors. Well, enough of Iran, let's get home. Well, now that I have my bastard daughter back, I feel like going to Celine Dion's house and asking her to marry me again. No, you're gaining a pop vocalist. It seems to have changed. What's going on, Phillip? How can Canada have changed so much whilst we were gone? I must take my bastard daughter back to Celine Dion and see what she has to say. Celine, I brought our daughter Sally back, and I want to tell you that-- Why?! You've got a man over, don't you, Celine Dion? What the hell are ''you'' doing here?! Oh, Celine Dion, what have you done? I was going to make us a family again, but now you've slept with Ugly Bob! Look at him, Celine Dion. What?! Nooooooooooooooooo!! Phillip, I'm convinced that something very very not good is happening to Canada. Oh, hello, Scott. Hey, Scott. Guess what? Ooh, stop that! Yes. We can get satellite feed from the U.S. and watch all their stupid T.V. shows. It's so stupid! They look like groundhogs. Hey, Phillip. Isn't that the smelly gentleman we've seen in pictures all over town? Well, we just can't sit here and eat Kroff Dinner and let Canada be overrun by the Turks! It sure did, Phillip. Oh, wait. That ''is'' the phone. Hello? Oh.  Hey, it's Scott. Phillip says hello, Scott. You are such a dick, Scott. ''You're'' a dick. ''You're'' a dick. ''You're'' a dick. ''You're'' a dick. I'm sorry, Scott. Could you hold on a minute? How do you like that, Scott?! Oh wait, I have another call on, Scott. Can you hold on? Oh, that was Sir Smelly. He says 'hello.' Oh, wait a second, Scott. Well, Scott said to meet him here, but he's not showing up. Oh. Good idea. Let's search for treasure. We're looking for treasure! Yes. You mean Saddam Smelly. We saw him on the telly. That plan's scary! For Canada, Phillip. Well. Phillip, I am very sad that we have to die for Canada. That's funny! Why is that? Yes. Apparently, he does. Oh, Phillip. It sounds like you have an idea. Well, I guess it's time, old friend. Now, Phlllip? We did it, Phillip! We destroyed the Turks! Ooh, it was all Phillip's idea. Hey, Scott, you like apples?  Oh Celine Dion. You never finished that national anthem. Sure thing, Phillip. Ah ha ha ha, you got me again!  Phillip, I've got good news, and bad news. The good news is, you have a clean bill of health. The bad news is, you have cancer. Yes. I'm afraid your ass is collapsing. Yes. See this X-ray?  That's your ass collapsing. ''Your ass'' is collapsing. No, it means that you won't be able to live anymore. We're doing an anal transplant. It's our only hope. ''I'' am, Phillip. ''I'' am. Just half my ass. Can you believe it, Phillip? Best friends, and now we're going to share the same ass. Oh, Phillip, I'm so glad everything turned out for the better. Hey, Phillip, pull my finger. Hurgh. Oh, wait wait wait. Pull harder. Hurgh, urgh. Damnit! Pull really hard, Phillip! Hurgh-rrh. Waiwait, wait wait. Hrhrhrhrh. Aha! Hr-rhrh. Oh my! Yeee-aaa! Hurh. Uhwaiwait. Ye-aauraah- Caught you there! Yes, I sure did!  (Fart)  Boo! Oh, Phillip, what a precious gift!     Come on, get a move on. I ain't gettin' any younger up here. That is correct.  Sustained. Madame Foreperson, have you reached a verdict so we can get the hell outta here? You're gonna have to repeat that verdict because we have some flatulence issues. We have, Your Honor. We have found Terrance, in the above entitled action of murder against Dr. Jeffrey O'Dwyer-- I said, we find-- We find Terrance-- Not guilty!! Hello, Is this Scott, from Canada? You're a Journalist, right? I understand that you hate Terrance and Phillip. Well, what about I help you get rid of them once and for all? Let's just say that I'm someone who can help you, if you help me. Just call me your old pal, Saddam Hussein. Eey, relax guy. I'm just your average Joe. Take a rest.  Hey. Take a load off. Put your feet up. Me and Satan were just aboot to go shopping for furniture. Come on, Satan. You want Terrance and Phillip out of Canada, I want you to bring me and my friends ''in'' to Canada. That sounds like a fair trade, doesn't it? Super! Let's get started. Eeeeeeyy, relax guy! Trust me! Go ahead, guy. This is Red Dragon. Excellent! My buddies and I are ready to come to Canada. Has everything been arranged? Hey, relax, guy. I'm gonna keep my side of the bargain. Huh? Oh that? Don't worry, guy, you just need a rest. Hey, relax, fella. I'm just making it so that Terrance and Phillip can never come back to Canada again. I just need a couple of days, and then I'm gonna head back to Iran. Iran, Iraq, what the hell's the difference? Relax, guy! Worried? Aboot what? Take a load off, relax. Taking over Canada? Me? Eeeyy, you need a rest, fella. I'm not hiding any bombs. Oh. You didn't? Hey, relax. I'm from Iraq. No, no. You need to relax, guy. Remember the plan: first we take over Canada, then we'll have to go after the female pop vocalist. After that, we'll take over the U.S., then Europe, then China, then Newfoundland, then the world! Nothing! Relax, brother. Oh, really?  Pray that I don't change it any further. He-yy there. I'm Saddam Hussein. I'm a big fan of Polo. I've been searching a long time for you, Celine Dion. Eh! Who are you? Really? I thought all Canadians looked alike. Let me see. Well, I'm sorry, guy. You know, I could cure that face of yours. Sure! I just need a favor. There is a Canadian football game tomorrow: the Ottawa Roughriders vs. the Vancouver Roughriders. It is at that game that I will officially turn the Canadian flag over to my Iranian one. Hey! Don't worry about that. Take a load off, don't worry about it. Look over here. All I need is for Celine Dion to sing our Iranian national anthem at the game - to finalize my hostile takeover of Canada. What do you say? No, no, relax there, fella! Hello to my Canadian friends. Everybody relax. Take a rest. Lift your feet up. Those Dogs Are Barking. You may have noticed some changes to your country. Don't worry about that, the changes will continue. I'm here to announce once and for all that Canada will now be known as "New Baghdad!" Qoloh Qalah! You will bow down to me as your ruler! You will obey my laws or you will be killed!! And now you will sing the Iraqi national anthem... Or you will be stabbed in the head! Hey!! What the hell is this? Hello, Terrance. Hello, Phillip. How can you guys say stuff like that? I know, but-- I can't help how I look. Besides, it's not what on the outside that matters, it's what's on the inside. Really? Hey, thanks, you guys. Maybe now I can score with chicks. Thanks, you guys. Hi, guys. People seem to really like it. I even have a date this Friday. Tehran is dangerous. You guys shouldn't go there! All right, then. There's a flight leaving today. Hi guys. I'm doing Celine Dion; what's it look like? Maybe the baby will have your face instead of mine. Oh no, you don't. She's my bitch. I'm Bob. But my friends call me "Ugly Bob", because I have the features of a deformed burn victim. You can? Did you say, "hostile takeover of Canada"? God bless you, Phillip.  Bark, bark. Purr, purr. Special delivery for Terrance. Sign here, and here, and here, and here, and here.  Terrance, this is quite a surprise. And you. She's in the Middle East, studying anthropology. Why? What?!  Oh, Terrance. What happened to us? Please, bring our daughter home safe, Terrance. Terrance, ha, could you come back a little later? Ah, I'm just a little busy right now. Well, I... What do you mean? Why are you calling him "Ugly Bob"? You told me your name "Handsome Bob"! Aaaaaaaaaaaagggggghhhhh!!! Oh my God, he's hideously ugly! And I am pregnant with his child! I'm going to have a freak baby!! Oh, Ugly Bob, I'm so confused. I love your personality, but you are so wretchedly ugly. We can only hope. I suppose we'll be okay as long as you keep that bag on your head. What's this?!  What? Why? Shtud balaa shtud inca inca brusht... Phillip, Terrance! You've saved Canada! You're right, Terrance. You're right. <poem><i>O Canada, our home and native land,</i></poem> <poem><i>God keep our land...</i></poem> <poem><i>True patriot love in all thy sons command</i></poem> <poem><i>Oh, Canada we stand on guard for thee</i></poem>  AAWWWW!  Ooohhh! Ming Li! Ming Li! Ming Li! '''Yeah!!''' That's right! Yeah!  '''Yeah!!''' Goo. Where? Pa-pa. Mr. Hussein, the U.S. Government is becoming worried. You seem to be... taking over Canada. We didn't say anything about bombs. We're giving you just three years to clear your forces out of Canada, and after that, we're gonna bomb all of Iran. Iran, Iraq, what's the difference? Euugh. I hate Americans. Please, let me kill them! ...well fuck you. Arrrggghh!  And this is what life would be like... The father of Eric Cartman is indeed, someone in this room. The father is-- And now, to continue, the father is indeed someone in this room. Gentlemen, the father is...  Where... where am I? Ohh. I'm sure it was my brother again. He tries to shoot me every month. I'm glad that you could all come. I can finally reveal who the father of Eric Cartman is. But first, I want to thank Kenny McCormick for sacrificing his life-- Alright alright. The father of Eric Cartman is... Say, did anybody see that ''Terrance and Phillip'' special last month? Wasn't that just the funniest thing-- Oh. As I said before, the father is somebody in this room. The father is... Mrs. Cartman.  Yes. It took quite a while for me to understand as well. You see, Mrs. Cartman is a hermaphrodite.  Meaning that she has both male and female genitals. No no, not exactly. But she did have a penis. The fact of the matter is, hermaphrodites cannot bear children, so Mrs. Cartman's DNA match with Eric can only mean that she is his father, and she got another woman pregnant at the Drunken Barn Dance. Well, that's that. Thank you all for playing. What? He's my father?! Man, this feels like the longest minute of my life. Ey! Wait a minute! I didn't find out who my father was!  Goddammit! Who's my father? You've got to be kidding me! Eeeehh..! Is he awake yet? They can't. Mephesto can't die. No way, dude! I can't stand to leave things unfinished. It's like when you hear the first part of that song, "Come Sail Away", by Styx. If I hear the first part of that song, I have to finish it. Yeah, du-I can't do anything until it's done. No! Don't! Eh-- Yeah, stop being a wuss! Can't you get him to talk? I have to know who my father is. Wake up, you son of a bitch! I can't wait anymore. What am I supposed to do? What? <poem><i>...We'll search for tomorrow on every shore...</i></poem> <poem><i>...And I'll try, oh lord, I'll try to carry on...</i></poem> What about Mephesto? Are you taking care of him? Lady-m? Is Mephesto gonna be okay? Sweet. Hey, who's screwing with the lights?  That is really starting to piss me off. Nnoh, that sounds pretty sweet to me. What if Mephesto never wakes up, and I never find out who my father is? Go, Kenny! Yeah. And now he's a freezy-pop. Just tell us already!  Dammit! Tell me who my father is already! Ugh. Man, this is fuckin' weak. Oh, wow, gee whiz, you think so, Mom?! No no, wait a minute! If... if she's my dad, then... who's my ''mom?!'' Ooohhh, forget it!  Reading sucks ass. Hey, there's a lot of big words in these books.  God, shut up, dude. I don't know, I'm kinda getting a tingly feeling looking at these.  Oh, how about Stan? Or Kyle? Oooaaagh. I'm prepared! For my book report, I read ''The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe''. It was very, very good. Have you read it, Mr. Garrison? Oh, good. In ''The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe'', a bunch of uh, hippies, walk around and paint stuff. They eat lunch, and then they find a magical... camel... which they have to eat to stay alive. And that's pretty much it; I give it a B-minus. God-dammit!  Goody two-shoes. Really? I wanna be a cop. Do I get a nightstick? 10-4, sergeant!  Ey! I clocked you at 40 miles an hour back there. Do you know what the speed limit is heawh? Step out of the car, please, sir.  Sir, step out of the car, please. Ey! I am a cop, and ''you will'' respect my authoritah! Get your ass to jail!  Sweet. Yeah, I've been working this beat for about three days now. You definitely have to have pretty thick skin or else these people, they just walk all over you.  Sometimes you have to go undercover to get the worst of them. Well, hi there. Uh, wha-what are ''you'' doing tonight? Sir, step out of the car, please.  Sir, step out of the car.  Maybe this'll teach you to listen to authoritah.  Yeah... Sometimes upholding the law is messy. But you get by. One day at a time. Sir, could you step out of the car, please? And-uhh who's, who's in here with you?  Poor people tend to live in clusters. Nothing. Now, sir, is there some kind of a... Okay, okay, let's try to watch the language; there's children present heuh. Now, the first thing to do in domestic disturbance calls like this one is to just calm everybody down. Respect my authoritah!  Chickenlover! Dammit! Can't this thing go any faster?!  Freeze! Put your hands in the air! I got reports that the suspect is ''in'' this area! A-ha! Well, ''he'' is not listening to my authoritah! Ooohhhh. Ey, that's what I've been saying all along, you guys. M'kay? What the hell is a "bris"? Oh, kick ass! I wanna have a bris! Yeah, my ass is ''killing'' me. I wonder who took it. I know. Drugs are bad because if you do drugs, you're a hippie, and hippies suck. Wo-what's that? Ham? Screw you! It's ham, isn't it? Hey! My mom says you're not supposed to call it a penis, Kenny! You're supposed to call it a fireman. That's the ''proper'' way to say it, or else you get a spanking. Dude! That is ''not'' cool! Choppin' off wee wees is ''not cool!'' Dude, yuh-eh-you just don't...chop off somebody's fireman! What the hell is gahekgafuga? They ''are'' gonna cut off his fireman! No way, dude! We're not staying alone in your house with your wee-wee-choppin' parents! What the hell is ''that'' supposed to be? Is that why it stinks so bad? No way! I'm never going back to your parents' house! Eech. Wait a minute! No, you wouldn't! Fireman! Well, I guess the chopping is about to commence.  Heyeah, I want to get a circumstision, too.  Eah, screw you guys! I don't wanna be in your penis-choppin' family anyway! Hey, you guys wanna come to my bris tomorrow? No way, I set up mine first, hippie! Okay?  What? Don't you have dodgeball in France? Damn, Pip. I didn't know you had it in you.  Dude! He's going to the nurse's office. Stan? Has anybody actually seen the nurse, and come back to tell about it? Did it talk? The little fetus, did it talk? Who the hell cares what it's called? As long as she doesn't have to touch me... AGGHHH! Let me live! AGGGHHH! Yeah. I thought we only played on Fridays. Heyh! They have a zoo there! Now, let's try not to send anyone to that monster nurse this time, Frenchy. I caught it, I caught it! Yeah, and if you don't, you're a big dumb-ass European hippie piece of crap.  I got a jelly roll! I got a jelly roll! My mom says there's a lot of black people in China. So, Captain Ahab has to get his whale, huh? I dunno. Come on, rice picker!  Oooh, I get it. Holy crap! I love you guys. Ah, screw you guys! Mr. Garrison, what's Vietnam? Son of a bitch. Was it fun? Man, Vietnam was sweet! Sweet. You're dead, Stan. Well, Stan, thanks a lot for having such a cool uncle that got us all detention for a week. Well, let's see... Maybe 'cause he's an old, drunk hillbilly dick! Totally.  Sweet. Oh, yeah, sweet. That's super sweet. Ah-yes! Lying kicks ass! Blululululululuh. I am the deadly Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka. I am very scary... And dangerous!  What? I know that!  It's a Sri Lanka frog! Der yourself, hippie!   Blulululuh. Screw you guys. Well, why do I have to dress up like an old lady? Ee-''goddammit!'' They better not! Scared of a plastic frog? Man, this is stupid. Eee-ee-ee-ee! Dude, totally.  Revenge is so very, very sweet. Dibs! That's it! Now I'm all pissed off! Take that, hippie! Ey, get off of him, you fuckin' nutsack! Ey, you guys! Yeah. I didn't ''wanna'' do it, Jesus. They ''made'' me do that. Sent her away where? What?  Hmmm, let me see. No! Mmm. It's chocolaty and delightful.   I can not possibly eat one more bite of its chocolaty goodness. Oh, but but but, but I'll try. All done! Ms. Crabtree? You guys. What if Ms. Crabtree doesn't come back, and we're all trapped here ''forever''. I don't wanna die on this- bus with you assholes!  You guys suck! Was that how it happened? God-dammit, how long is this goin' to take? What?! I'm missing the new ''Fantasy Island.'' What do you think it is? Hey. Maybe it's our teacher, Mr. Garrison. Oh no? Don't you remember the time he went crazy, and tried to kill Kathie Lee Gifford? Now, that's what I call a sticky situation. Oh, yeah. Hey you guys. Can we order a pizza? I wonder when the monster is gonna come back to feed again? Hay, wait a minute. Remember the time when Fonzie jumped over the buses with his motorcycle? Now, that's what I call a sticky situation. Uheheheh, heh.  Oh yeah, I guess that doesn't make sense. It does? Aw damn, man. Now I'm missing the new ''Barnaby Jones.'' Hey! Do you guys remember the time I found out who my father was?

Yes, please. Mmmm.  Mmmm. Your parents are dead? Goddamn, you suck, Pip! Eeyy! If you so much as touch Kitty's ass, I'll put firecrackers in your nutsack and blow your balls all over your pants!  Well, I'm just saying na, don't mess with Kitty na. Okay, that's it! Screw you guys! I'm going home. What do you guys want to do? We've got the whole summer to play! Stan? Guys? Don't you notice anything wrong with this picture? Ugh... Whatever. Hey, you guys, my mom signed me up for swimming lessons at the community pool. You wanna come? It is not!  I am not swimming around in pee! My mom says that if I take swimming lessons, I could be in the Olympics someday. I'm trying to make the best out of a bad situation! I don't need to hear crap from a bunch of hippie freaks living in denial! Screw you guys! I'm going home. No, screw you guys. Home.  Eh-eh-eh-eh... Nuh-uh. I don't wanna. Egh-- Huh? First graders? Awww! Weak! Weak! Oh, these sons of bitches! Later's fine. I only know how to do it doggie style. Can I do it doggie style? Sweet..! Awww, dammit! Aw, not again! No way! Those sons of bitches!

Selling T-shirts kicks ass! Whoa! Yes. And I've learned something, too. Being a sellout is sweet. Because you make a lot of money. And when you have money, you don't have to hang out with any poor-ass losers- like you guys. Screw you guys, I'ma goin' home. No way, dude. Kenny's family's poor; they live in the ghetto. Oh weak! What?  Where is the Nintendo? Oh, good. I'm starving. Pfff..!  What kind of side dishes will we be enjoying this evening with our frozen waffles? Am I to understand there will ''be'' no side dishes? Puh! I heard that. Oh, Jesus, are you fucking kidding me?  Heh, we apparently don't say 'side dishes' at the table, either.  Ey! Man, your family ''sucks ass'', Kenny. Whoever heard of frozen waffles for dinner? It's my Urkel sleeping bag. Isn't it coool? Argh! You have rats in your house, too, Kenny?! Dude, seriously, you'd better stop being so poor, or else I'm gonna start huckin' rocks atcha.  But mom, seriously, it ''itches''. I can't stand it!  Mom, seriously, it itches. It itches!

Endor is very cool." Mom, answer that! "They have trees and Ewoks, and barbecues, which is why I like Endor more than America. It's cool." I remember frozen waffles with no side dishes. ''She what?!'' That bitch! I'm gonna go downstairs and kick her square in the nuts! We want you to give ''our'' parents herpes. Hell no, you guys get your own! Hey, how come ''you'' don't have sores on ''your'' lips, Ma? Hooray! Well, I know one thing for sure. We're ''all'' gonna need a lot more calamine lotion. Planetariums suck!

Wweell, I ''might'' have been over at the Cheesy Poofs call-back, winning regional championship! This is my regional championship certificate! Do you like it?  Hey, where is your regional championship 'tificate, Clyde? Oh, you don't have one? Hmmm. Do you have a regional certificate, Wendy? Nno? Apparently, only I do. Your haiku insults have no effect on me, Kyle. I'm regional champion. It's between me and four other kids. I'm on my way now with my mom to the finals. I wasn't picking it-I had an itch, for cryin' out loud! I don't know. There's a lot of competition here. Hey, look! They're giving away bread outside! Sike! I know, I know! Thank you. I'm not pickin' it ma! God damn it, I have an itch!  Yes! I'm the best!  Sweeet! I'm over here. Aay! Let's hurry. This costume is hot. <poem><i>I love Cheesy Poofs, you-</i></poem> Oh, Mom, for Pete's sake! <poem><i>I love Cheesy Poofs-</i></poem> Oh, man, c'mon! <poem><i>I love Cheesy Poofs, you love Chee-</i></poem> What?! Oh, God damnit! Hi, Grandma. It's me, Eric. I just wanted to remind you that I'm gonna be on television tonight, so be sure to watch. Okay, bye. Stan? I'm gonna be on TV tonight. Be sure to watch. Where the hell is everybody?! I'm gonna be on TV tonight. You guys better not miss it! Oh, dude, here it comes! Yes! Yes, that was me! I was on television! Well, well well! You guys can now kiss my ass, because I was on television! Ey! Didn't you guys see it?! I was on television! You missed it! You missed it because of this stupid planetarium! Planetariums suck ass! What the hell are you talking about? Wow. What a day this has been. I was on TV, ''and'', I'm a hero. God damnit, Mom, I wasn't pickin' it! I have an itch! What is this? Halt! It will take more than your weak American weapons to destroy me! I have Class 4 armor on, that, uh, ih-ih-- --special armor, that's impenetrable to American bullets. That's fine! I'd like playing with myself! I'll play with myself all day long! What? ''Herr Kommandant'' Cartman has ways of making you talk! What are you guys doing?  A clubhouse? Heheh, that's the lamest thing I've ever heard!  Wwwhy?? That's fine. We'll build our own clubhouse! Fine! And then we'll get girls to play Truth or Dare, too! Fine! Fine! That's fine. Fine! No, Kenny, you can't look, I'm the foreman! Because, Kenny, your family's poor. You have to be the worker. No, Kenny. Mom, it's not a treehouse, it's a clubhouse! Mom? Can we pull up the carpeting in the living room?  But Mmmom, the blueprint says we need carpeting in the clubhouse! Kenny, my mom says you can go get carpeting in the living room now. And stop your bitchin'! So, how's your lame-ass clubhouse, Stan? We'll see about that.  Don't forget you need to cut school early and wait for the hot tub, Kenny. Mr. Garrison, Stan's behavior is having an adverse effect on my education. Look at it, Kenny. It is the greatest clubhouse ever built. Oh, man! And we built it, with our own hands. Now all we need is chicks, Kenny. All right. You go find chicks, Kenny. Because I have to stay here and work! I still have to shingle the roof, test the foundation, run all kinds of inspections. I've got way too much to do, and all you have to do is to go find chicks! Now, stop your bitchin'! Mom, can I watch ''American Gladiators''? What the hell is goin' on in this cartoon? Oh. Hey, Kenny, did you find any chicks to come to the clubhouse?  Holy crap! Behold! The Ewok Village 2000!  How's the clubhouse coming, Stan? Well, I just thought I'd tell you that me and Kenny have finished our clubhouse, and we already have chicks over. It's only a matter of time before we're playin' Truth or Dare with them. Good luck with your piece of crap clubhouse, stupid asshole. Ahaw, that's weak. That's killer. That's totally weak! Sweet. Killer weak, sweet! I had the same thing with my mom the other day. I'm all like, "Ey! I am not a little kid anymore! Ma, I'm eight years old! And if I wanna fingerpaint, then I'm gonna fingerpaint!" Totally. Uuuuuh my mom gives me shit sometimes, and I tell her to shut her hole before I kick her in the nuts!  Okay, we have to play Truth or Dare, quick! Who the hell are you?! How many people? Hey! When are we gonna play Truth or Dare? This is bullcrap! This sucks, Kenny! I wish we'd never built a clubhouse! Oh my God, they killed Kenny! Wwow!  Oh, dude, I gotta win those. How much to play? Five dollars?! Jesus Christ! That's easy! Ay! Check it out! Damn it! Take this, Jennifer Love Hewitt! I'd like to see you do better! I only have three dollars left, asshole! Sweet. I only need one, dude. I only need one. How much is it? Let's see: each ticket is a dollar, so three tickets is like two twenty-five. Oh come on, you guys. We'll still have plenty of money left over. I'm right! Eh! God-damnit!  I don't know what you guys are talking about! That scared the crap out of me! Kyle, will you relax, you pink eye? We have plenty of money. Come on, you guys! It'll be sweet! I think we're almost to the end. How much? Hunh that's, that's pretty sweet. What? This is cool. It is, too! Aah, three dollars. Yeah, but I didn't take into account the fact that I suck at math. Ey! Seriously! Well, I'm sorry!  Hey! I bet Kenny has some food stamps on him! Damn it, Kenny, don't be such a food-stamp hog! Share with the rest of your friends! Sweet. What the hell makes you think Cartman rides a bull? O-kay, I'll get on the bull. I guess, damn! Hey, this is sweet. I'll try. Ten seconds is a long time.

Hey, where did you guys win all those Terrance and Phillip dolls? Wait a minute! You guys did make me ride that bull! Oh! Son of a bitch! Yeah, I can’t get this stupid song out of my head.

How much further is it to Grandma's house? I wanna see what kind of present she got me. Why does Grandma have to live so far away? Why don't we just stick her in a nursing home closer to us so  I don't have to drive six hours to ''get a god-damned present?!'' ''Over the meadow and through the woods...''  Hi, Grandpa! Sweet. What is it? Yes! Move it!   I'm not fat, I'm big-boned. Ech. Al-righty then. Let's get to my presents, shall we?

Dude! D'you think if we hit him with a shovel, he'd shatter? Dude! You're a big fatass, ''and'' your mom's a hermapholite!  Hey you guys. Check out these books. ''[They come over.] Sabrina Unchained''.  If we read, are we gonna become like ''that'' guy? I don't know. Let's go see. Whoa, dude! How do you have sex with a chicken? Hey, what's this? Yeah, I wonder what's wrong. I don't know. Oh my God, they've killed-- Oh, never mind. I can't see, dude! No, we just fake it to shut him up. Dude, I think Barbrady enjoys being in school a little too much. Oh, my God! They've killed-- Oh, never mind.  It's cool, dude. We'll help you. "If you want to know where I'll strike next, read ''Bumbly Wumbly and the Spotted Spacecraft''". I. A pond? Hey, maybe that means Stark's Pond. Well, the chickens don't seem to really mind. What's it say? What's it say? I dunno. Come on, dude, it's not that hard! Maybe we were wrong about the clue. Look!  Oh my God, they've killed-- Goddammit! Aw, I think that's a mask, dude. What are you talking about, dude?! That doesn't... make a whole..lot of sense, dude. Cartman! Hey! So what are you going to do now? They want you to give a speech, Officer Barbrady; about the whole experience over the last couple of days. I'm just glad everything turned out okay, and Barbrady got his job back.  Booooo!  I'm sorry, Mr. Mackey, m'kay? Why do dogs have cold noses? Oh. Your little brother's having a party? Why, is it his birthday? Hey, are we supposed to get your little brother ''presents'' for a bris? Well, dude, you better find out! Sorry, Mr. Mackey, m'kay? Man! That sucked, getting searched. No, dude, we never even saw it! We know, we know, that's what ''everybody'' says. What do ya mean? Ahhh, bicycles? Your eyes? Dude, something tells me this bris thing isn't good.  Kyle! You have to stop them! Dude! I found out what a bris is! I found out what they're gonna do to Ike! They're gonna chop off his wee wee! Yeah, dude! It's a Jewish tradition! It's called a circumstision! Dude, I asked five different people. They said all Jewish boys have circumstisions, an-and they make it into a party called a bris. What are you goin' to do, dude? Dude, I think you mom's gonna notice that isn't Ike. Dude, what did you make that doll out of? Come on, dude. If it were your little brother, we'd help you. Dude, you shouldn't have told them that. Now they're gonna find him and cut off his penis! Oh my God, they've killed Kenny! Maybe you're being too hard on him, dude. Oh, hey, that doesn't sound like a bad idea! Whoa, dude, I guess having a bris isn't all that bad. Yeah.  Naturally. You can't have your bris tomorrow, Cartman, that's when I'm having mine.  Okay, Mr. Mackey, okay? Yeah. Look, Pip, the rules are simple. A kid from that team is gonna try to bean a kid on our team in the head with a big red ball. If the ball hits you, you're out, but if you catch the ball, he's out, and the last team to still have anybody standing wins. Jordan, Swanson, pull forward! We need backup. We're losing men fast out here!  No, Cartman. Nobody ever has. Wa-was it wearing clothes? Oh, yeah. Eeww. AGGGGGGHHHHHH! No! I have to get it out! ARRRGGGGGGGHHHHHH!  Dude, I don't get it. Why are we playing dodgeball again? Aw, do we have to? Aren't we supposed to have won something in order to go to State Finals? Whoa, dude, this is a school?  Okay, what have you got? Sweet! A jelly roll is perfect! Places! Chef, we're hungry. But Chef, we don't wanna play the Chinese! Dude, Chef has lost it. Hey, isn't that kid Kevin Chinese? Tell us how the Chinese play dodgeball! You don't? Damn, dude. China's fucked up. Oh my God, they killed Kenny! Yeah, shut up, Pip.  Can we go home now? Dude, it's the freak nurse! Yeah, maybe that dead fetus makes her smarter. Dude, my uncle Jimbo was in Vietnam. No. We have to do a stupid report on Vietnam. You and Ned are the only guys we know who were there. Whoa! Wow! "...and after killing the entire Vietcong Army, they returned to base camp." "Once there, they rode the Devil's Drop roller coaster." "...and ate cotton candy. And ultimately, Ned got the Purple Heart for his courageous defense of the log ride." "So was the horror of Vietnam." The end. From Vietnam veterans. No, no, we didn't-- Bu-but we're not making it up, it was-- For ''what'', dude? Why would he just invent a story instead of telling us the truth? How? Well, what do you mean? Yeah, what a couple of dumb-asses. Yeah. Ready, you guys? Okay. Action! Cut! Cartman! It's supposed to be a frog! Since when do frogs talk, Cartman? Okay. Here we go. Ready? Are you ready, Cartman? Action! Come on, Cartman, the way we're filming this, nobody will even know it's you. Okay, when I yell "action", you start to walk this way, then Kenny's going to pull the plastic frog in front of you, and you have to be scared. It's acting, Cartman. You have to pretend you're really scared, then the Mexican staring frog will look you in the eyes, then you fall down, like you're dead, okay? Ready? Good. A-and action! They deserve it for lying to us, dude. They're here! Hurry and hide! Holy crap, dude. Dude, he's okay. That frog wasn't even real! Dude, it's just a plastic frog; it's not real. Check it out! We shot all those videos and sent them in. Yeah. Come on, Ned. Quit fakin'. It was just a joke; we didn't think it would hurt anybody. Whoa, I don't take drugs and worship Satan! That's lying! Well, I only..did it 'cause... he..molested me. You big piece of crap! Oh, my God! They've killed Kenny! W-we only did it because Jimbo lied to us first. We had this report on the Vietnam War for school, and we interviewed Jimbo about it and he made up all this stuff about Vietnam, and he got us in trouble. Mr. Garrison said that there was no way that you could have defeated the entire Vietcong Army by yourself. Wait a second, I don't take drugs! That was a lie! No, your producer did. She made Jimbo tell everybody that I did drugs. During the break. Your producer came over, and told Jimbo what to say about me. She told him to lie! W-we're sorry, too, Uncle Jimbo. We're sorry for making you look stupid in front of the whole world. Hey, Cartman! Are you gonna share any of that cake with the rest of us? Give us some, Cartman! Dude, the road is always snowy. Shut up, Cartman! Dude, she always tries to quiet us down by threatening to kill that bunny, but I wonder if she ever would. Come on, fat boy, give us some cake now. Where are we? I don't think we're in a very safe spot. Dude, this is not good! She could've at least kept the heat on. Dude! Would you just relax? We've been in a lot worse situations than this and come out of it just fine. Well sure. Don't you remember that time that the aliens kidnapped your little brother Ike? Now, ''that'' was scary.}} Now, that was what I call a sticky situation. Do you see 'er dude? No, kid! You heard what Ms. Crabtree said: there's a big black scary monster out there! Hmm. Maybe Ms. Crabtree ''did'' make up that stuff about the big black monster. Well, I guess nobody else will be getting off the bus. What time is it? Dude, I think it's Saturday now. Well, we can't go anywhere or else that big scary monster outside will get us. I don't know, it's- a big scary monster. What? Okay, so we can agree that the monster outside can't be Scuzzlebutt, because Scuzzlebutt's nice. But the monster outside couldn't be Mr. Garrison, 'cause Mr. Garrison used a gun. ''What was that?'' Dude, I think the scary monster is right outside the bus! Yeah, but the monster outside couldn't be Death, because Death only touches you, it doesn't eat you. Oh my God, it's killing Kenny! Hoh boy, we're in big trouble. Yeah. There's got to be a way out of this. What? You dumbass, Cartman! That's not the way it happened! Oh no! Now we need more weight in the back. No, that's too much! I don't know how much longer we can keep this up, dude. Hey yeah! Dude, did it ever occur to them to just look for us? Boy, do I! Cartman, no! The bus is going over! GAAA-uh. Ugh. Oh, dude. What a nightmare. Dude, I just had the weirdest dream. Yeah, I dreamt that Cartman dreamt that we were all trapped on a bus, and then he dreamt that we were talking about things that had happened, only they were all wrong, and, and then he and his mother ate beetles. Yeah, I must be having some real emotional problems. Sure. I definitely don't wanna sleep anymore. See you later. Shut up, Pip. Oh yeah, dude, it's summer. That means we gotta buy fireworks. I saw in this movie once, where this guy stuck a firecracker up a cat's butt. Jesus, Cartman! The kind that fit in Cartman's cat's ass. So, we'll have ten M-80s, please. Heard what? How can they do this to us? Doesn't anyone believe in tradition anymore? A summer without fireworks is like… I don't know, but it's like-- It sucks ass. Man, it's hot out here. I know! Let's go sledding! Come on, Cartman, get on. What the hell are you waiting for, Cartman? What the hell is going on? Hi, Uncle Jimbo. Yeah, they're not even having them at the lake this year. Why does everything have to suck so bad in summer? Summer sucks ass, Mr. Garrison. That's good. Right. Swimming lessons? Dude, that is the lamest thing I've heard heard. Everyone knows that the first graders pee in the community pool. Whatever, dude. But Cartman, we're trying to-- What does he mean, "living in denial"? There, how does that look? Uh, crap..! He's taking swimming lessons. How are your swimming lessons going, Cartman? Yeah, they need to shut it off. Oh, my God! They killed Kenny! Man, this sucks. We should do what we always do. Ask Chef for help. Dude, I think he told us to go fuck ourselves. How many days left in summer? Dammit! I just want it to snow again! Hi, Uncle Jimbo. There's nothin' to do. Hey, look! We blew up the snake! Winter's back! Well, I can hardly wait. Hey, Chef! Hoohh, like ''Independence Day''? That sucked ass, too. Oh, my uncle Jimbo has a ''ton'' of those movies in his dresser drawer. She's ''not'' my ''girlfriend''. Damn, dude. Look at all these people. Whatcha doin'? Calm down, tubby. Shut up, Cartman!  When's this thing start? I hope there are some good previews. They what?!  Oh, brother. Dude! Dude! Aw, dude, you don't even wanna know! Yeah, pretty much. The theater sucks, though. They need to get a bigger screen. Yeah, but <i>that'd</i> be like IMAX. Are they good? Hey, dude, these ''are'' good! There is ''what'' again? Dude, how do you tell if a piece of poo is in trouble? To the sewer, dude. What was that? Mr. Garrison? What do you mean? Well, why don't you just ask them to leave? Well um, it ''does'' sound like a pretty sweet movie. Jeez, they made that into a movie already?  Serves you right, Cartman! You're a sellout! If you work in the entertainment business and you make money, you're a sellout! So what do we do now? Why?  Are you gonna be okay, dude? I'm here for you. Okay! Sorry. Aw, dude, ''I'' shouldn't be seeing this! Blaach! ''No'' problem, dude. What the hell is he doing? Oh, that's okay Wendy. I forgive you. Dude, you've got ''herpes'' on your ''face!'' Ow! Yeah, it's pretty weird. We're here to have a slumber party with Kenny. Catch what? Sshh! Cartman! Whoa, dude! ''You've'' got herpes on your face, too! Huh? Dude, I think I just saw a ''rat!'' I don't think it's very healthy to sleep with rats. Oh.  Goody? What do you mean, "goody"?! Chickenpo--? Oh no, I must have caught it from Kenny last night. Well, you sure seem happy about it! Okay. Well at least I'm not gonna die from it like ''you'' might! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! I don't wanna watch this! I wanna watch ''Terrance and Phillip''! Well I've got the remote, ''bitch!'' Hahaha.  No way, dude! We're gonna watch Terrance and Phillip ''all'' day-- Ey! Get me out of here! Homework?! But I'm in the hospital! That son of a bitch! What kind of sick weirdo is he? Not Mr. Garrison, Ma. He really is a sick weirdo. Wait! Where are you going? Milkshakes?! Weak! And so that's why ''Knight Rider'' was the best show in America.  Sshh. Wake her up and we're ''both dead''. Yeah. What are you talking about? They did? Why?  Of course! Cartman, our parents sent us over there to catch chickenpox from Kenny! It's some kind of parental conspiracy. Our parents are trying to ''kill us'' or something. How does someone ''get'' herpes? But what if we ''want'' to give somebody herpes? My dad has five dollars on top of his dresser.  And have Shelly kick my ass? No thanks. Plus, I have to get my parents back just as much as you do. Thanks a lot, Frida!  I don't ''wanna'' go back there. Don't you guys feel like brushing your teeth first? You know, freshen up your breath. Pretty good. Wow, coo-hul! We got you back for getting ''us'' sick. We had a prostitute use your toothbrushes and stuff. Oh my God, they've killed Kenny! Can't we just be like normal third-graders for a little while? I don't know, like, learn about art 'n music and go on field trips and stuff. It's boring. Whoa, dude! You're only as old as us; shouldn't you be in school? This is stupid. Me neither, but... I loved the planetarium. I don't know. I don't even remember what happened. Yeah, mine too. Van Gelder?? What the hell are you doing on our bus?! Mr. Garrison, there's some freaky kid from the planetarium on our bus! Alright, dude. Mellow out, jeez! That's a haiku? Oh. No. Yeah. What's a discharge? Yeah, I wanna go to the planetarium again, too.  Yeah, why ''do'' we wanna go again so soon? Where have you been, Cartman? Does that mean you're gonna be on that Cheesy Poofs commercial? Dude, what just happened? Come on, we've gotta get out of here before something bad happens. Mr. Garrison, we think that the planetarium guy is- Dude, this isn't right. We're kids, dude. We don't volunteer for anything. Come on, we've gotta see what's going on in there. Kenny, you go out there and tell us what you see. He hits this switch- Yeah, I guess so. I don't know. This says "maximum." Oh my God, we've killed Kenny! Dude, I told you something was up with this place! ...and then we turned the dial, and Kenny went into a kind of hypnosis. Yeah, pretty sure. What other crime in South Park? Oh, no! They got Chef, too! Why are you doing this, dude? Mr. Mackey! Get over here and untie us! Oh my God! Dr. Adams! Yeah. With nobody around to say anything. Sgt. Stanley Marsh is trapped behind enemy lines. His only chance of survival is to sneak past the Bosnian guard who stands watch. Sgt. Marsh knows it's now or never. He must make a run for it. American base is only a few feet away. Cartman, we shot your Bosnian fat ass! No, you don't! Yeah, Cartman, you suck! If you want to play Americans vs. Bosnians any more, you can just play with yourself! Huh-I dunno. Hi, Wendy. No. We could? But dude, I don't have a clubhouse. Just how many guys' clubhouses have you been in?  Truth or Dare? Wow. Come on, Kyle. We've got work to do. We're gonna build a clubhouse. I have to ask my dad for help. Hey, Dad, we need to build a clubhouse. How do we do it? Yeah, dude! How'd you know? Dude! Sweet! This is a sweet spot for a clubhouse. Oh uh, just that, mmmaybe when we're finished, Wendy and- uh... Bebe can come over and play. Well-uhuh, of course they do, but uh, wouldn't it be sweet to- to play Truth or Dare with them? Because, dude. We could make them do really gross stuff, like eat bugs. We're building a clubhouse. Yeah, now beat it you guys. This clubhouse is private! Fine! Fine! Getting a cookie. We're building a clubhouse and then we're-- 'Kay. But Mr. Twig sucks. Better than yours, fat boy. Almost. Yes, Mr. Garrison.  Um. You said that even though- Charo appeared twelve times on the ''Love Boat'', the episode with Captain and Tennille got higher ratings. Phew. No, I just-- I'm not lying. Someone just handed me the-- But I didn't write the note! Shut up, Cartman! Oh, man. Whoa, dude! What's 'skylarkings'? Who? Oh, no. It wasn't my note, dude. It was some girl's. Excuse me. Hello? I got in trouble for that note Bebe was trying to pass to you.  I mean, no. Not to you. Forget it. Come on, dude. We have to finish our clubhouse quick. The girls wanna play Truth or Dare tomorrow! My mom won't let us. Pretty good. We're almost done. We're going as fast as we can! Come on, dude, we have to hammer faster. No. I didn't even think about that. And I say, "Dare!" "Truth?" But that's boring! I want to get "Dare" to kiss her. Oooh. Yeah. "Dare!" Oooh. You really think so? Wow! Hello? We're working on it. No, you don't! Dude! Aw, that hunk of fat--  Mom, will you please ask Dad to come help me build my clubhouse? What?! Why? Divorced? On no. Does that mean you and Dad don't love me anymore? This is all my fault, isn't it? ...Dude, you're not supposed to say that! What?! This is happening way too fast. Okay. We're done. It doesn't matter, dude. It only has to last long enough to play Truth or Dare. I'm gonna go get the girls. G'oh? Go where? But no! I have to get the girls to come- Weak! Dad? But I don't understand why we have to-- Well, I don't like being around my sister anymore; does that mean I can leave her, too? But you and Mom are family; how come you can just split up? You know what I think? I think that when you and Mom got married, you became family. And now that you are, you shouldn't be able to leave her anymore than I can leave my sister. What? That's it? I guess, but-- Okay, dude, the girls are gonna be here to play Truth or Dare any minute. No way, dude! Don't be silly. We have to say "Truth" a couple of times before we say "Dare," right? Because if we don't, we'll seem too eager. To say "Dare," dumbass! Jeez. Oh, hi Wendy. What's up? Yeah! I mean, sure, whatever.  Remember, "Truth" the first couple of times. Dude! Don't be a chicken, dude. Just close your eyes. Dude, Cartman is in his clubhouse playing Truth or Dare with girls right now. You really want him to beat us?  Dare. ...Dude, we cut firewood all day yesterday! We have enough to last twelve years! Crap! Do you mind if I watch cartoons? I've had a rough day. What? My dad lets me watch cartoons. Roy's a dick! He ruined my chances with Wendy in the clubhouse! If that's true, then get back together with Dad for me! Oh. Divorce is stupid. Yeah. Yeah, I think I'll write a little note for Roy. Wow. Clubhouses are magical. Dare. ...What?! Are those REAL Terrance and Phillip dolls? They look all crappy. Really? What's that? What the hell was that? Yeah. What the hell kind of carnival company are you?! Yeah, this line is way too long! Here we go. What ride? My ass we will! Yeah, let's not ride that ride again. We're gonna try to win those Terrance and Phillip dolls again. Sir? Will you take food stamps for three balls? Sorry, Officer Buttbaby. Oh, I'm sorry. What did I say? This is hopeless. We're never gonna have enough money to win.  He really wants those dolls. Alright, this mechanical bull's gonna help you practice for the real thing, Cartman. We'll start on the slowest setting and work our way up. Ready? Go. How long was that? Damn it! That wasn't ten seconds, Cartman. You have to do better than that. What are you going to do? Oh, yeah. That's a good idea. Hold on, Cartman! Come on, Cartman. You okay, dude? Cartman, hello? Hel-lo? What's the matter with him. But can he still ride a bull? Cartman. Cartman, can you hear me? What?! Oh, he's fine, dude. Oh, yeah, dude. Let's get his ass to the rodeo. How's he doing? Do you think he can ride the bull? Cool. Jesus, dude! Oh, hell! Kenny, you go find Cartman. We have to go sign him up for the bull ride. Kenny, where the hell is Cartman?!  There he is! Yeah, and then those Terrance and Phillip dolls will be ours! Dude, I'm having second thoughts about this. I'm startin' to think that maybe it's wrong to put someone who thinks they're a Vietnamese prostitute on a bull. Dude, that bull's gonna kill him. Oh my God, they killed Kenny! We did it, dude, we did it! Yeah. And we have $5000 this time. Wow, why'd you get so cool all of a sudden? We should- Dude, these dolls are cheap rip-offs!  Say, Terrance, let's look for treasuh. Oh, hey, Cartman. How are you feeling? Oh-h. Nowhere. But we hate Mr. Twig. Mr. Twig sucks. What, dude? That's what Cochran used in the O.J. Simpson trial. Oh, no, dude. Chef's gonna go to jail. Hello there, Chef. Well, don't worry. We came over to cheer you up. You do? Hey, why don't you ask all those famous people you used to know for money? They're rich. We've gotta help him, dude. Come on. Maybe those rock stars will remember Chef. Let's go pay them a visit! Yeah, it's bigger than Cartman's ass. Could you just buy a couple anyway? Our friend Chef is really-- Wow, you remember him? So will you buy some of our candy bars to help him out? Hey, Elton, if I give you these lyrics, will you write a song for my girlfriend, Wendy?  'Kay. Thanks, dude. Hello, are you Meat Loaf? Our friend, Chef. Wow! So you'll help him? Yeah, thanks.  That’s $35. Come on, you guys, we've gotta hurry and give this money to Chef! Wait! Wait! What are you doing? No, you don't! You can't take Chef's money! It's illeg--! No more Chef. We can't let him down, you guys. Dude, it's over. He's gone. No! Chef wouldn't give up on us. How many times has Chef gotten us out of trouble? It's easy, dude. Chef Aid. Yeah. We set up a stage, and have Cartman do the German Dance. Then we charge people for tickets.  Dance better, Cartman! Elton John! What are you doing here? Boy, do we! Yeah, dude, it's all yours. Wow! How'd you get out of jail, Chef? We’re gonna raise your money, Chef. Oh, my God! Ozzy Osbourne bit Kenny’s head off! I wonder why Cartman wasn't in school today. Cartman, how come you weren't in school today? What? Stop screwing around, dude. We're all gonna go meet at the store later to buy pumpkins to carve. Dude, this is creepy. Wow, really?! Hey, I love Aunt Flo! Wow! I don't know. I ''don't'' like it. It's spooky. Do I have to? Damn it! Dude, my mom's having her monthly visitor. Yeah. Every time she shows up my mom turns into a total bitch. Yeah, I wonder why he's being so nice. Hey, Cartman! Did you bring us money from your mom? Yeah, but we can't get a pumpkin, so we can't enter the carving contest! Why do you keep saying "hella", fatass?! Can you leave the light on, Dad? I wish Aunt Flo didn't have to visit now. Where did it go?  Hey. Where did the shirt go?  Look. He's gonna kill me, Mom! No! AAAAAAAAH!   But-  WAAAAAAAH! Mooomm! Mom, I was just sleeping. And the next thing I knew-   Mom, what are you doing? Mom, do you think ''I'' killed that guy? It was the ''fish''! He says I'm next! But MOM! MMOOMM!  No, mom!  I haven't been sleeping so well. Kyle, you know how some people are, like, murderers and stuff? Do you think animals can be murderers, too? I haven't been sleeping well. My pet goldfish killed another random person last night. What are you doing?! Chef, I have a goldfish that keeps killing people. What? Of course! My pet goldfish must be from the evil, opposite universe, too!  Dude, that's not cool. She's got Parkinson's disease. Cartman! Aunt Flo, where did you get this goldfish? Do you remember ''what'' pet store? Where? That's it, dude. We've gotta take the spooky fish back to that pet store. Just help me take it back. Come on!  Did you find the address, Aunt Flo- Aunt Flo! It was the ''fish''!  Now we'll ''never'' know where that pet store is! Aunt Flo isn't from South Park. The pet store could be anywhere between here and Denver.   Yeah, my goldfish-. I know. Come on, let's go!  Mom, I know you think I did all this, but I'm gonna prove to you it was this fucking fish! I wanna return a fish. ''Yeah, dude.'' So you just- built your store on top of an Indian burial ground? Why? We think that when you did that, you opened up a doorway to an evil, parallel universe. Look, pal. This is very simple. All I want to do is return this fish. I don't care, dude! I just want this fish away from me! Wow! Thanks, evil Cartman!  Yeah! I'm sure glad that's over with. Now I can sleep at night. You know, evil Cartman? I like you a lot better than our Cartman. Yeah. You know, I never thought it was such a bad, little squash. It just needs some tender, loving care.  We won, dude! Don't worry, Evil Cartman. You're staying with us!  Why don't you guys take ''our'' Cartman back? He's more like you anyway.  Up yours, evil twin!  Sorry Cartman. We like Evil Cartman better. See ya.  Stop wasting time, Cartman! We have to send one of you back to the evil universe! ''Our'' Cartman would ''never'' say anything like that. You tricked us, Cartman! But Mom, all the guys are going to Cartman's Grandma's for the weekend! But all the other guys get to go to Cartman's Grandma's; why can't I? I don't want your lame-ass supper!   Okay, let's go! 'Course I'm coming! Come on, let's hurry! So, how far is it to Nebraska? Yeah. Or, we could ''not''. This is Nebraska?  Dude, I thought Mr. Hankey lived in the sewer. What's he doing in Nebraska?  He's the ''fat'' one. Sick, dude.  Yeah, right! My family's dead!  They're dead to me. My mom doesn't even know I'm here.  Dude, is he here every year like this? Dude, I don't know how long I can stay here. What, dude?  Kyle, we ''are'' in a house filled with Cartmans. What was that? I wanted to make sure we're not dreaming.  We thought you were in jail.  Wake up, Cartman, we've got to get to the mall. ''All'' families suck ass! Do you really think we should go with this guy? Not yet. I think we still have a ways to go. I really like that guy.  You look a lot bigger than the last time we saw you. Oh, boy. You've done it now. Where did you go, Uncle Charlie? Hey. Where's Kenny? Oh, hey Kenny. There's a bunch of policemen chasing after us! Oh ooh.  ...Sorry.  Dude, they're gonna kill me.  'Scuse me. I wanna go with you. Please, I don't wanna go back with them. I ''know''! They've come to ''punish'' me. All they wanna do is make me pay for comin' to Nebraska in the ''first'' place. What?! But they don't care about me, they just want to punish me.  I hope you can forgive me, too, Mom. Really? Hooray! Uh, I mean, wait. What? Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here. That's okay with us.  Oh, not Tweek. Dude, we can't work with this kid. No. Okay, we have to do this stupid report, so-- Sooo, let's figure out what to do it about. Great. A lot of help you are, kid. What? What gnomes? Yeah, I've never seen any underpants gnomes. Yeah, we have to stay up all night to write it. 'Kay. Maybe it'll help us figure out what to do our report on. We have to present it to the entire South Park town committee tomorrow.  Wow, that sucks, dude. Yeah. Kind of bitter. Aooooo! Yeess, this stuff rocks!  Whoopee! Yeah, mine too. I wonder why.  Well, this is just great! We haven't gotten anything done, and we're totally screwed! Bad! ''[goes with Kyle to get it] No'', we'll use it. Wow, Tweek, your dad rocks! Perhaps there is no stopping the corporate machine. Huh?? Our case? Uh... Hooray. Uh... ''[rising from the bottom] I like small businesses.'' Your dad really screwed us, Tweek! 'Cause then they'll know we didn't write it, dummy! We have to be original!  Yeah, that makes sense. How do we stretch that into five minutes? What the hell?  Hey there, little guy. Hey, he talks! Dude, why are you taking Tweek's underpants? Business? Wait, do you know anything about business? Cartman, will you just shut up and let him show us? Damn, dude, this place is huge! I don't get it. No you don't, fatass! Oh my God, they killed Kenny. Yeahyeahyeah. Look. We've gotta know about corporate takeovers tomorrow or we're screwed. Do you know anything about corporate ''take''overs? Underpants? Uh. Since we are so concerned with the corporate takeovers, we went and asked our friends, the underpants gnomes, and they told us all about big corporations. Even Harbucks Coffee started off as a small, little business. But because it made such great coffee, and because they ran their business so well, they managed to grow and grow until it became the corporate powerhouse it is today. And that is why we should all let Harbucks stay! Holy crap. dude! This guy rules! Yeah! Dude! Good job, Cartman! You killed Kyle! Why the hell not?! That's like calling the sky blue!  Can you climb back up, dude? Damn it, I guess I'll have to go get him. Whoa, dude. This is making me sick. Blaach!  Bluchluchluchluch. Sorry.  All right. Just grab the rope. Wait a minute. What's this? He's like, some frozen guy. Shut up, Cartman!  Dude, I saw this in a movie once. The old cavemen get frozen, and then people discover them and make them their caveman friends.  You guys, there's a frozen ape man from the past down here! Send some more rope!  Help me chip some of the ice away. Hey, remember when that kid found a wallet and got a reward? Where shall we bring it? I think I'm going to name it Gorak.  ''You'' didn't find him, ''I'' found him. You wouldn't even have noticed it if I hadn't pointed it out. Huh, excuse me? I found this frozen guy in the woods today. Really. Wait a minute! His name is Gorak! Dude, I wanted to call him Gorak. No, it isn't! I'm not being a dick, ''you're'' being a dick! No, ''I'll'' go! I found him! Oh my God, they revived Gorak. Uh, hi. He said, "hi." He wants to know where he is. You're... home. Dude, you've been frozen 32 months. Oh, shut up, assmaster. You're just jealous 'cause they had ''me'' talk to him. Oh yeah? Well ''You're'' not ''my'' best friend anymore, either! Cartman is now ''my'' best friend! Fine!  He doesn't look very happy in there. I wasn't talking to you, buttpipe! I was talking to Cartman!  You guys aren't being very nice to my creature. Let him out, dude. He's scared.   Gorak! Gorak! Are you there? I don't think it's fair for them to keep you captive like this, Gorak. I came to bust you out. What are ''you'' doing here? What?! You can't. I'm here to bust out Gorak. His name is Gorak! Gorak! What kind of stupid-ass name is Steve?!  No he doesn't!! I found him, I'm rescuing him! You're a dick! You're a dick, and I've had it with your dicketry! I choose you! Tomorrow at the bus stop, 4 o'clock!  Dude, ''Terrance and Phillip'' is on at 3. I'll kick your ass so bad you'll wish you never had it- to begin with! Your ass, I mean.  Damnit, Cartman, you're supposed to be helping me to get ready to fight Kyle, not playing Australian outback guy! You suck as a best friend, Cartman!  What are you doing, Gorak! Wow, that sucks, dude. What are you doing here, dick?! We're not supposed to fight until 4 o'clock! Gorak is busy freezing himself again, dick! Oh, no you don't, glory-monger! Gorak is ''my'' responsibility. ''I'll'' take him to Des Moines! Come on!  We need a one-way ticket to Des Moines, please. My friend, Gorak! ''No'', he's not gonna melt away! That's Frosty, you stupid butthole! Dude, look, it's 4 o'clock. 'K. O-okay. 'K   Ow! Watch my coat, dude. Huh?   No problem, Gorak. Yup.  Right on. His... name... is... Gorak! They're after you!  Where's Gorak??  Wait, look! The helicopter! He's alive! Kyle, Steve was a... pretty good name for that guy.  I hate having Cartman as a best friend. Hey, what the hell's going on? Mephesto's been shot. Then who was it? Yeah. God only knows who they'll kill next. I sure hope that I'm not Eric Cartman's father, Mr. Hat.  What?  Like sailors on a submarine.  Whew. Uuugh, could we hurry this up? My stomach is growling. I... can't... go on... eh. So... hungry...  Eat Eric Roberts! This snow just isn't letting up. We're gonna ''die'' here, I ''know'' it. Oh! I can't... go on.  Ohh. It's over! We're free! Well, I'm bringing home some Eric Roberts in a doggie bag. Does anybody else want some? Noo, that doesn't make sense! Uh-meaning what? Okay, children. Each of you gets to choose two books from the Booktastic bus. Eric, shut up!  Now, children, we have a new student joining us today. Please say 'hi' to Officer Barbrady. Okay now, since our focus has been on reading, let's review some of the basics. E-yes, what is it?  Officer Barbrady, in school we go to the bathroom before and after class. Now, does anyone have any suggestions where we should begin with Officer Barbrady? Now, Kyle, let's be supportive of our new student, give him the nurturing environment he needs to thrive. Now, I'm gonna write a sentence and I want us all to help Officer Barbrady read it. Give it a shot, Officer Barbrady. Bzzzt! Wrong! Try again, dumbass! Hahahahahahaha  Okay, okay. Maybe we should try something a little easier. We can work our way up to the hard ones. Go ahead, Barbrady, don't be scared. Bzzzt drrrrr! Did you hear that, Mr. Hat? Okayheh, okay hi'm sohry. I'm sohry heh. Let's try again. Now, children, I hope you all had a good time reading your books and are prepared for your book reports. Who should we have go first, Mr. Hat? Let's see... Eric, why don't you go first? What's the matter, Eric? Are you not prepared again? No, I can't say that I have. And I give you an F, Eric. Now sit down! Okay, Officer Barbrady, why don't you give us your book report? Thank you, Officer Barbrady. That was a very good book report indeed. I'll give you an A. Aw, you couldn't screw anything, Halfy. You don't have any legs! Conjugate the verb. Conjugate the verb. Okay, children, let's take our seats. This morning we're going to have a special lecture by your school counselor, Mr. Mackey. Yeah, and now we're gonna make sure you get the help you need. And so ''now'', children, your school counselor is back, to tell you firsthand about his nasty experience with drugs and alcohol. "What's Vietnam?" A question a child might ask, but not a childish question. Heheheheheheheheheh. Children, for the next few days, we'll be learning all about Vietnam. Chances are that somebody in your own lives was affected by this incredible war. No, I wasn't in Vietnam, but sometimes, I like to ''pretend'' I was. Anyway, children, I'm going to assign you all a paper. I want you all to find somebody in your own life who was in Vietnam and interview them about it. Then you get an F, fail the third grade, and have to get a job cleaning septic tanks to support your drug habit. Yes.  Where the fuck did you hear this ridiculous load of bullshit? Well, boys, it's obvious to me that you didn't do your work, and that you stayed up all night thinking up some ridiculous lie. You all receive an F...minus. Stanley, the Vietnam War was ''war!'' There weren't galloping steeds or singing birds or log rides. Well, that's it! All of you have detention for the rest of the week! Okay, children, now I know that today is the last day of school, and that the last day of school involves pranks, but this is going too far! What have you done with Mr. Hat? Children! I want Mr. Hat back, right now! The prank is over! You think I can't get along without Mr. Hat, don't you? You think I can't live without him? Well, I can! He's just a puppet. I don't need him. You see? Watch. '''God damn it! Where the fuck did you put Mr. Hat?!''' Oh no, you don't! The school year is over, but summer vacation doesn't start for you little bastards until Mr. Hat is back on my desk! Now, I'm going to turn around, and when I turn back, I expect to see Mr. Hat lying right here! Okay. I'm going to turn around now. Shit! Hello, children. How is your summer going? Oh, that old thing? Why, I almost forgot he was gone. I don't need Mr. Hat. Mr. Hat is just a puppet. Mr. Hat isn't real. Hello? Is this some kind of joke? You go to hell! You go to hell and you die! I'm gonna find out who you are! Goddammit..! And I can't sleep or think... Where would he have gone? Why would he leave? How the fuck should I know? If I knew that, I wouldn't be seein' a fuckin' psychiatrist, would I? At first I was sure one of the children took him, but then I remembered that Mr. Hat and I actually had a fight that morning. What?! Are you propositioning me? Well, I can tell that that I am 100% not ''gay!'' Mr. Hat, on the other hand... Sometimes he fantasizes about same-sex relations. Sometimes Mr. Hat liked to pretend he was in a sauna with Brett Favre, and a bottle of Thousand Island dressing. Well, I'm just sayin'. I think you're the loony one in this room. Serves you right, you gay-bashing homo. Wow, it's a black blizzard! Oh, I'm through with Mr. Hat. He's a two-timin' whore. From now on, children, you're all gonna be learning from Mr. Twig. Okay, children. I have some very exciting news for you... Oo-why don't you tell them, Mr. Twig? Nono, Kyle. These are ''independent'' films. Eric, if you call Wendy a bitch one more time, I'm sending you to the principal's office! That's it Eric, you-! Anyway, children, I want you all to see at least one independent film at the festival and then write a paper about it. The first film showing is called ''Witness To Denial'', and it's a sexual exploration piece about two women in love. Oh uh- hello, children. Oh I- I was just-uh hangin' out. Children, do you know how to file a police report? Good. See you in school. And so, children, that's how you tell a prostitute from a policeman. Now, are there any questions? Yes, Kyle? Uh, that's a good question, Kyle. Are there any other questions? Right, right. Uhh... Well, class, I'm going to assign you all a paper. The theme of the paper will be, "How I would make America better." Uh, don't worry, Kyle. I'm sending homework to all the children who are out sick. They'll have to turn in a paper, too. Okay, children, what do you think Barnaby Jones meant when he said, "This is not a victimless crime"? Anybody?  Children, were you paying attention?! Oh, well excuse me, Kyle! Why don't you just ''forget'' what Barnaby Jones has to say?! Why don't you ''not'' pay attention to Barnaby Jones and then let's see how far you get in society?! Okay, Stanley, why don't you tell us how Barnaby Jones knew the poison was in the milk? Oh, and what do you consider normal?! Well, Mr. Smarty-Pants, it just so happens we ''are'' going on a field trip tomorrow! To the planetarium. Oh now, what's wrong with the planetarium? Well, too bad! You're all going to the planetarium tomorrow and you're all going to love it! In the meantime, we're going to watch episode #203, ''Barnaby Under Siege''. Oh, sorry, I taped these at home, so there's more commercials. Okay, children, let's quiet down so the nice bus driver can concentrate on the road.  Ow! Jesus, lady! Okay, children, now I'm going to remind you that this is a planetarium, not a Bangkok brothel. Let's behave ourselves. Come on, Eric. We're going to the planetarium. No, you have to go in this building and see a bunch of stupid stars! Now, come on! That's a pretty weird bone disease. Well, kids, how did you like the planetarium? Really? What did you like best about it?  Wait a minute. Where is Eric? You snuck off and sang that stupid song?! Oh, great! Well I guess we have to go back!  We've better get him to the nurse's office, stat! Okay, children, today we're going to learn all about Japanese poems called haiku. A haiku is just like a normal American poem, except that it doesn't rhyme, and it's totally stupid. For example- Uh, where is Eric Cartman? No, I'm asking why Eric Cartman isn't at school. Was he on the school bus this morning? Hoh, very good haiku, Kyle. Yes- haikus have five syllables, then seven, then five. Kenny, can you give us another example? But you were just there! Why do you wanna go again so soon? Well, I guess we could go again, since it's just down the street. Eric, where have you been? Very good, Kyle. They just begged to come back; I couldn't get them to shut up about it. I'm just gonna step outside and go weewee.  What the hell are you boys doing? You're supposed to be in there. Oh, for Pete's sake, Clyde. You just went! Well, I guess I could give them extra credit for it. And so, children, today we're gonna focus on American history, right Mr. Twig? What did you say?! I told you to never mention that name in my classroom again! Mr. Hat is a two-timin' whore, and now we all learn from Mr. Twig! That is enough! Mr. Hat is gone, and he isn't coming back, and I don't wanna hear it! Anyway, children, lets turn our history textbooks to page 105, which should be right after page 104... Stan? Are you paying attention? Well, then, Stanley. What did I just say? ...Well, okay. I suppose you were paying attention. Anyway, children, the Love Boat did go on for about eight years. They tried to bring it back recently, but it didn't work. Probably 'cause Robert Urich had to weigh... Stanley, are you passing notes to Kyle?! Don't lie, Stan. Lying makes you sterile. Stanley, if you think it's so important to keep interrupting my class, then why don't you come up to the front and read your note to Kyle for everyone to hear! Stanley Marsh, you come up here right now and read your note! You know, uh, excuse me, but I agree. These rides are really stupid! Chamber of Farts isn't scary at all!  Hello, children. Ready for lunch? Eric, is there a problem? "Stinky Britches" by Alanis Morissette? Children, did you say hi to Mr. Twig?  I told you never say his name in my presence. It just so happens that Mr. Twig is far more stable than Mr. Hat could ever be, so he's the better puppet now--  How dare you! Come on, Mr. Twig. Mr. Twig, is that you? Mis-Mr. Twig? Aagghh!! Mr. Twig! No! Who did this to you, Mr. Twig?! Who?! I need some help over here! Please help! I think he's got third-degree burns!  Is he going to be all right, doctor? Is he going to live? ...Dammit, don't give me that medical jargon! Just tell me straight, is he going to be okay?! I brought you some more juice, Mr. Twig. Are you feeling any better?  Mist-Mr. Twig... are you okay? Mist-Mr. Twig..? Aaaggghhh!! Who did this?! You won't get away with this, you bastards! Thank you for coming, Officer Barbrady. These pictures just arrived.  Now, go arrest him! What? Yes—Yes, I’m sorry.  It can't be. These can't be right. Mr. Hat! Did you think I would just take you back? Like you can just, walk out and then, come back like nothing happened? Oh, don't look at me like that, Mr. Hat. Remember, you're the one that left. I'm not going to take you back. You can just go to hell! You go to hell and you die! You are a lying bowl of turd, Mr. Hat! ...I hope you starve, you lousy son of a bitch! What are you all looking at? This is just between me and Mr. Hat. What do you mean? What? Jail? ...And Mr. Twig is at home, he has no idea Mr. Hat is even back. I mean, I care a lot about Mr. Twig, but Mr. Hat and I have so much history. What?  I warn you, Chef, don't even think of taking advantage of me in this prison cell.  You're still aren't entertaining ideas of raping me in this prison cell, are you, Chef? That's good. Oh, boy, we're free! Wow, what a daring rescue. Mr. Hat! Mr. Hat saved us, Chef! Come on, let's get in the truck! I'll drive from here, Mr. Hat. Don't worry, Mr. Twig. Even though Mr. Hat rescued me from prison, I'm still going to stick with you. It doesn't matter. He left me. Yes. But I feel like I'm making the wrong decision. I'll never forget you, Mr. Twig. Thank you.  Yes, Stanley? ''No it isn't, it makes you very sad!'' Now, apparently, the school board thinks that I don't teach you anything about current events, so tomorrow they're going to have you do presentations for the whole board.  "Current Events in South Park". Now, I want you all to read a newspaper, or better yet, watch television, and come up with something current in South Park to do a report on. Now, this'll be a group project, so I'm going to place you all into groups of five. Let's see, uh. Wendy, Bebe, Clyde, Pip, and Tolkien, you'll be Group 1, and Group 2 will be Stan, Kyle, Eric, Kenny, a-and, and Tweek. There's nothing wrong with Tweek. I bet he'll do a great job in your group. That's what Chad Everett thought when the new female intern joined the cast of ''Medical Center''. He thought, "Who is this woman with her gazungas and high heels? What does she know about medicine?" Well, that intern soon saved Chad Everett's brother with a kidney transplant. So, you see?  Well, let me put it another way. You have to give your oral report to the entire South Park Town Committee tomorrow. And if it doesn't kick ass, and you make me look bad, Mr. Hat is gonna smack you bitches up!  I don't think they wrote this, Mr. Hat. Well, boys, it's obvious ''you'' didn't even--  Yes, great job. Yeah, well, I don't want to sound like a dickhole, but I told you so. Thank you, Mayor. I don't wanna sound like a dickhole, but I- Uh, boys, can I have a quick this and that with you? Boys, I don't know who wrote that report, but now that you've convinced everybody, you'd better stick with it. 'Cause if these people find out you didn't really write that paper, and I actually do get fired, then Mr. Hat is gonna do horrible things to you.  Oh, not that, Mr. Hat! That's '''really''' horrible! Anyway, good luck passing your new law, boys.  That was close, Mr. Hat.  Uh, boys, you better get your asses to work. They're expecting you to give a big speech on corporate takeovers, and this time it has to last five minutes. You little turds!! You've ruined my life for the last time!! It's a power outage! Hey! This window is shot out, too! That means the killer was not someone in this room! There's a murderer free in South Park. We have to find out who it is before they kill again. What are we gonna do, Mayor? This killer is on the loose! Mayor, shouldn't we be focusi-- Holy smokes, that blizzard is getting crazy! Well,  we're not going anywhere for a loong time. I hope you all realize what we might be facing here. Our only option might be to... ''eat'' each other to stay alive. That's the law of land, Mr. Director. It ain't pretty, but if a few of us must die so the rest can stay alive, so be it. Well, we draw straws. Calm down, soldier! We need every person here to keep his head! Barbrady, fetch some straws. Alright. So far, everybody has a long piece of straw. We'll keep drawing.  Whew. Wait a minute! Where the hell is the short one? Dammit, Barbrady! When you draw straws, you're supposed to have one of them ''short''! That's how you decide who loses! We have to have the energy to make it through the night. We have to eat. There's only one answer: eat Eric Roberts.  God wants you to live, Mayor. Fight! What time is it, Barbrady? We'll give the storm another hour. After that, we might have to eat again. It ''is'' amazing what people can do under stress. Just look at the pyramids. Nobody knows how they built those, or who. Listen, everybody. We did what we had to in there. Get outta the way, you damn hippie! What? Aw, why don't you go to a Grateful Dead concert?  Tough love, Mr. Mackey. We're taking you to rehab.  Excuse me, Mayor, but I just received some news that you might all be interested in. Our South Park Cows have just beaten the Washington dodgeball team, and are on their way to the world championship in China. Hi, I'm Jimbo Kern, and this here is Ned. Say hi, Ned. Arrgh-ha-ha-ha! Now, isn't that great?  --no longer works. So now, we only kill animals to, quote, "thin out their numbers". If we don't hunt, then these animals will grow too big in number and they won't have enough food. So you see, we have to kill animals, or else they'll die. Uhh... So roll the tape. Here we are at Schaefer's Crossing, lookin' for some animals. That sure was a great hunting trip. We saved those deer from extinction. Comin' up next, we're gonna drop some napalm on an unsuspecting family of beavers. And also, try to thin out the numbers of some endangered species. And now, time for ''Jimbo's Mysteries of the Unexplained''.  One of our loyal viewers from South Park sent us some 8mm film of what ''he'' claims to be the Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka. Now, as you all know, the Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka can supposedly kill you with one horrid gaze. If a person even so much as looks into the frog's eyes, they can be paralyzed, or even die. And this film proves that that frog may very well exist. Now watch carefully, you're gonna see the Mexican staring frog. There! There, did you see it? Roll that back again! Now, freeze it! Well, I'd like to know what all you skeptics have to say ''now!'' What do you think, Ned? Oh, lookie who's here. My little nephew Stanley. So, you're interested in your Uncle Jimbo's big TV show, huh? Oh. Yeah, we sure were. Well, sure, Vietnam was fun. But not like goin-to-the-circus fun, or fly-fishin-in-Montana fun. No, Vietnam was more like shovin' shards of broken glass up your ass and then sittin' in a tub of Tabasco sauce fun. Yepper, that's where me and Ned met. I remember I had just gotten off the Ferris wheel. And that's the way it happened, boys. Wow! Holy smokes! We could get an Emmy! Welcome, hunters. Boy, have we got a show for you today! We have just received a tape from another viewer who filmed the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka right here in South Park. Yes, now we're about to roll the film, but remember: if you look the Mexican staring frog in the eyes, you could go catatonic. We don't know if this applies to pictures of the frog or not, but who wants to take chances? So when we roll this film, be sure to look away. Okay, roll the film, Tom. Is it over? Okay, it's over. Well, there you have it. Undeniable proof that the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka exists. And you saw it here, on ''The Jimbo and Ned Show''. Well, it appears as though a lot of you "skeptics" thought that the film we showed of the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka was a fake. That you say it didn't harm anybody. Well, it just so happens that we just received ''another'' film from another anonymous viewer.  Roll it! There you go! Proof that not only is this frog real, but it is doing harm to the people of South Park ''as we speak!'' Well, that does it! All this week, Ned and I will be-- --risking life and limb as we go on location to hunt the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka. Join us, won't ya? Anonymous tip? Hey, Ned. Remember that time when we got the anonymous tip back in 'Nam? Yep. That war was hell on everybody. Wow! Do we got more money? Let's hunt! Hit the deck! It's him! The Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka. He's right over there on that rock. Dumb-ass! You've got to keep your eyes away from him! Stay down. Ned, you take flight position; I'll try and keep it turned away from you. Hello, fellow hunters. Have we got a show for you today. The Mexican staring frog is sunning itself on a rock directly behind us.  We've got to take the frog by surprise. I'm gonna create a diversion using this incendiary device, while Ned will ambush him from the rear. Now, Ned! He's not looking! Quick, Ned, hit him with the shotgun! Now, Ned! Ned. Ne-ed? Oh, no! Come on, Ned, buddy, snap out of it! Come back to me, buddy. Hold onto your butts. Take that, you demon frog! Ned, Ned? Can you hear me? Quick! Somebody, call an ambulance! This man is catatonic! ..."but Ponyboy was beat up pretty bad. He kept saying, 'stay gold.'" Aw, Ned. If you can hear me, y-you've ''got'' to snap out of it, 'cause if you don't, uh-I'll never forgive myself. Aw, Stanley, he's gone! My only friend in the world is gone! Aghh! What the hell are you doing? I almost looked right at it! What..? ''You sent in those videos?!'' My best friend is a vegetable, and I'm gonna be the laughingstock of South Park! You boys don't understand. Ned was so freaked out by the idea of the Mexican staring frog that he must have sent himself into a deep coma. Uhhhh... Thanks? That's right, Jesus. No respect for their elders. As some of you may know, I host a local show on hunting. Thanks. We've been hunting the Mexican staring frog for a week based on some video footage we received from a viewer. Well, it turns out that these kids faked the footage! Like what? Satan. Got it. Give you a taste of your own medicine, you little fibber! Roger. I'll tell you why. Because he's on drugs and worships the devil! Why, you little piece of crap! Hey!  Bring it on, you bitch! Hey, now. Everything I told you boys about the war actually happened. I uh... Well, okay, I might have em''bellished'' the truth a little, but that's different. Well, sure. I mean, eh...  Well, no uh, I guess not. It's true, she did. Hu-I'm such a tool. I'm sorry, Stan. I was just trying to tell a good story. I never meant for you boys to get in trouble. Aw, he'll be fine. I'll just take him home and show him some good hard-core porn, he'll snap right out of it. Won't you, Ned? Yeah. Titties and beer. Hey there, boys! How come you're not blowin' things up? It's summer. What?! Oh my God!  Buckle your seat belt, Ned. México, my amigo. To buy fireworks. Just 'cause some kid blew off his hands doesn't mean the rest of us have to suffer, now, does it? Hell, everything's legal in México. It's the American way. Buenos dias, mi amigo. Yo soy un Americano espectacularrr. (Good morning, my friend. I am a spectacular American.) Yo necesito el fireworko spectacularrrr. (I need the spectacular firework.) Would you look at that, Ned? That's a Tijuana bottle rocket! These babies have enough power to blast a fiery hole right through the ozone. Ned, it's our job to get these to children all over America for the Fourth of July. We'll be like Santa Claus on Christmas morning. I guess that goes without saying, doesn't it? Hello there, fellow American. We're just anxious to get back to our homeland. Fire away, we have nothing to hide. No, sir. Yes.  I mean, no! No! Damn! Damn! I always get that question wrong! Well, Ned, looks like we missed Fourth of July again. Dammit! Those poor kids must have been so disappointed to have nothin' but them stupid wussy snakes to light. Yeah, you're right. Okay, let's try again. No.  Yes? Dammit! I got it wrong again! What's the answer again? Holy smokes! What the hell is that? Quick, Ned! This is our chance! The Hummer's outside! ''Buenos gracias'', boys. Oh, now, why the long faces? Well, I don't think those are problems... ...that some Tijuana bottle rockets can't solve! Careful with those, now, those are dangerous. Point 'em away from your eyes, now. Aw, look at 'em, Ned. Look how much happiness a little firepower can bring to a child. Well, how do you like that? Bottle rockets saved the Fourth of July! Well, it's snowing black ash, but what the hell. This year is a very special Cow Days because we are revealing our all-new Cow Memorial! Which will live forever in South Park from this day forward. Release the curtain!  Okay, everybody! It's time for the Running of the Cows! Okay, everybody, okay. Settle down. Now I know you're all anxious to get to the Running of the Cows, BUT, let me remind you: those brave souls who have decided to run against the cows through town do so at their own risk. I don't think I have to remind you that three people died in last year's Running of the Cows. With that said, let's rock and roll! Everybody ready to run? Release the cows! They're loose!  Yeehaw! All right, damn it! We're not going to stand for this! Now, whoever stole our golden cow memorial, we're gonna find you and kill you! Aall right, uhow about this? Whoever took the sacred cow, just please return 'im, and there'll be no questions asked. Wait a minute. You folks from out of town. You're the only ones with a reason to take our beloved cow memorial! Okay, that's enough-a that! You cows need to dis-perse! All right, bad cows! Do you hear me? Bad cows! All right, Ned. You're gonna have to bust out the whip! Holy crow! Play dead, Ned! You hear that, cows? You're surrounded! There's no way out! Hey. Where's she going? That's the wrong way, you stupid cow! Nnoo! They're killing themselves! Stop! Please! Can't we do anything?! Oh, God, the humanity, Ned! The humanity! Yeah. They're dead, mayor. They're all dead.  Oho, it was awful!  Cow after cow taking its own life, and we could do nothing to stop them! Oh, God!  I hope so, Mayor. I hope so. God I need a cold beer and a burger. What's all the ruckus over there? Oh, hell, I have to run home and get my broom! Hey, aren't those the people we at first thought took the wooden cow? Aw, I forgot all about 'em. Is everybody okay? That sounded like a gunshot! Is he ...dead?  He's still breathin'! He's not dead.  We've got to get him to the hospital. Come on, children! Don't let him bleed on my Meredith Baxter-Birney memorial towel. I actually was ''with'' Meredith Baxter-Birney in this very car. And afterwards we used that towel to...  Wait a minute. Why am I telling you this? ''What?'' We have to get to the hospital. Sorry, Stan. We just gotta drop Mephesto off and then we can get outta there, alright? Come on, children! We've gotta find a doctor!  Doctor! Doctor! We've got a shot cracker outside! Whoa! Wait a second. They've closed the pass?? What do you want me to do? I used to watch ''Quincy''. So how do we get to it? The power! You're at the hospital, Mr. Mephesto. You were shot. Now, we don't know who tried to shoot you, but-- Ooohhh. He went off looking for Mr. Kenny. What??? You mean, at the Drunken Barn Dance, when we all got together with her, ''she'' was a ''he''?! Hello there, children. Bad. Children, I heard about what happened at school today. Now, none of ''you'' took that nasty marijuana, did you? Okay. Because I just want to tell you that drugs are ''bad''! Right. But do you know ''why'' they're bad? And do you have ''any idea'' what that means? Look, children. This is all I'm goin' to say about drugs: stay away from them. There's a time and place for everything, and it's called college. Do you understand? Okay.   Oh, hell no! I can't bear to see that! Don't you boys know what a bris is? They're going to circumcise him. Oh boy. Here we go again. Children... Uhh... What's the one thing that's more sacred to a man than anything else in the world? No, no, no, children, I'm talkin' about the most important part of a man's body. That's right. A "fireman"? Dammit, children! Why do I always have to be the one to explain all this stuff to you? Ask your parents for once! Okay, children, it's Friday, and you know what that means for PE class. We're gonna play dodgeball! So let's have half the children on this side   Play ball! Aheeheh, you're out, Clyde! Heheheh.  Concentrate on your ge-hame! ''Be'' the buhaw-hall! Great catch, Kyle! Now your team's on offense! Okay, that was pretty good, Pip, but you're supposed to hit the kids on the ''other'' team. That nose is bleeding pretty bad, Kyle. I think you might have to go to the nurse's office. Sorry, son. You'll ''have'' to let the nurse look at it. Come on.  Children! Great news! We've been asked to play in the State Finals for dodgeball! You-you don't understand, children. If we can win State, we can play in the Nationals in Washington, D.C.! That's right! Now, come on! We have a lot of practicing to do!  Now, who's gonna win the State Finals? I think we need to get off on this exit. But it's quicker to get to the Denver school ''that'' way! How many times do I have to explain this to you?! I'm not a student! You can't give me an office referral, and-!  Yes, ma'am. I'm Chef, coach of the South Park Cows.  Yeah. Dammit, come on! Somebody catch the ball! Great job, children! Just stay focused now. Whoa-ho-ho-ho! Great shot, Pip! You got just one more, Pip. You get this kid, and we are State Champions. We did it, children, we did it! We're going to Washington, D.C.! How much further is Washington, D.C.? I need to know how far it is, lady!  Yeah, whatever, you old, dried-up, fat hog. I said, "I've always wanted to visit Prague." Damn, man. This is the big time, alright. You can eat after the game. You children win this one, and you're National Champions! Then you can go on and play the Chinese. What? Yeah. What? We did it! Children, we won! Okay, children, back in the bus. Okay, children, now, we're almost to China. I want you all to try and focus on your game. Nonsense! If we win this one, we're world champions. And just what price would you pay for eternal glory? Just imagine: a big yellow "Dodgeball Champions" banner hanging in the cafeteria! Imagine it! You'll be in the news all over the world. South Park will finally have a sport that it's good at. Ohh, children, it'll be glorious! Hey, hey hey! Children, that's not cool! You don't make fun of somebody because of their ethnicity. No, no, no, no, no, that's different. I made fun of them because they are ''from'' China. You see, it's not okay to make fun of an American because they're black, brown, or whatever, but it ''is'' okay to make fun of foreigners because they are from another country. All right, let's go, Cows! Let's show 'em what we've got! Holy crap..! Goddamn...  Oh, what have I done? You know, Eric, I just realized something. I have been obsessed, and obsession isn't good. If we had won the world championship, what then? It would only be a bigger letdown the next year if we ''didn't'' win! Our lives would have to revolve around dodgeball. Our lives were fine before. Oh, I'm sorry, children. I let it all go to my head. Can you ever forgive me? Come on, forget this stupid game. Let's go home. Shut up, Pip. Hey, children, everybody! I'm back! I'm back from Aruba! What the..? Okay! E-verbody get in a line, so I can whoop all your asses! Hello there, children! Children, this whole film festival thing has quite lucrative monetary possibilities. Now I'm gonna sell some of my famous cookies, to these Hollywood types, and make a ''mint!'' They're little cookies, with ''fudge'' in the middle. And I call them, "Fudge 'Ems". I can just see the commercial now. "Wife got you down? Boss makin' you angry? Kids yellin' atcha? Well, Fudge 'Ems." And I've also got my ''double'' chocolate cookies, "Fudge This." Well, perhaps you'd like to try my low-calorie cookies, "Go Fudge Yourself," or my all-natural, "I Don't Really Give A Flying Fudge." Huh? Whose goose? Get 'em while they're hot! My all new cookies! "I Just Went And Fudged Your Momma!" Children! I'm glad you're here! I want you to check out my new confectioneries. I think they're going to sell right through the roof! I call them, "Chef's Salty Chocolate Balls." Try 'em.  It's all gone to hell, children. And we're all to blame. Even me! I was sellin' out my town, too! And now look at it. There's nothin' we ''can'' do. Just sit here and suck on my balls. Come on, Kyle. It's time to go.  Well, uh-I kinda hope not. I mean, ''sure'' it does. Here. I'll give him one of my Salty Balls to take with him to poo heaven. Come on, let's go. My Salty Chocolate Balls must have re-juvenated him! You're daaamn right. Well, it worked once before. Oh, ''damn it'', not now! Damn it! Children, what are you doing here? Terrance and Phillip are about to go into surgery! What makes you think I would know anything about ''that?'' Well you get it by sharin' relations with somebody who already has it. You have to be ''very'' careful around someone who has herpes. Well, there's old Frida down on Main Street. She has a ''mouth''ful of herpes. You need to ''stay away'' from her. ''Oh'', then, Frida's the right person to go to. O-kay! Wait a minute. What the hell did I just do?  Hello, children. Welcome to the planetarium.  I love my work. And then, they'll ask, "Truth or Dare?' No no! You say, "Truth." You have to say "Truth" the first few times. Or else, you seem too eager. You can't seem too eager. You've got to play it cool, like you don't even care what happens. Then, after a few "Truth"s, you finally answer, "Dare." But not like that, son. Like this: "''Daaare''". And then her little friend will dare you to kiss Wendy. Of course she will. They're women. They've had this whole thing planned out months ahead of time. Hello there, children. What did you say? Eric, where did you hear that song?  Well, I'll be sodomized on Christmas. Children, I wrote that song 20 years ago. Yeah. Back when I used to be in the rock business. And now it looks like some big record company has published one of my songs. Aww, I don't want any money. I just like to see my name on the credits, that's all. Well, all right. Maybe I will go. I’ll play them my version of the song. So you see, Mr. Big record producer, "Stinky Britches" was something I wrote several years ago. Huh? Now, look, I’m trying to be cool about this, but you just can't rip people's music off! It's against the law! Sue ''me''?! You stole one of my songs, and you’re gonna sue me? Right. Why "uh-oh"? Uh-oh. What? Whoops?! Do I look like I have two million? This can't be happening..! Hey, that's my favorite chair! Hey, children. Children, that record company guy is takin' all my belongings. And if I don't come up with two million, I'm going to jail. Okay, okay, children, thank you very much. I feel much better. Sure. Just please stop. This? This is my photo album of all my times in the rock business. Did I? Janis Joplin, The Beatles, Elton John... I got to travel all around the world, hanging out with bands, going to lavish parties, lovin' many, many women. Nothing. Anyway-- Hey! That has no monetary value! What the hell are you taking that for?! But I have 24 hours to come up with your money! That's the law! That does it. You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna raise that two million, but I'm not going to use it to pay you back. I'm going to use it to hire Johnnie Cochran myself and sue you! Watch me. Now get the <b>fudge</b> out of my house! Okay. Thank you, Mr. Cochran.  Well, Johnnie Cochran will take my case if I can pay his legal fee, $2 million. Oh, they wouldn't remember me. All I did was cook for them. I appreciate that, children, but raising $2 million is not an easy thing to do. My only hope is to whore myself to every woman in town. Wish me luck, children. No problem, Ms. Broflovski. Uhh, now, about that hundred bucks? I have a loooooong way to go to raise the kind of money I need. Uh-uh, hold on a second, Veronica Crabtree. How would you like to use some... sex toys? Like this very special device. I call it "Chef’s pleasure bag". Now, all you do is put this paper bag over your head, and it increases your sexual pleasure. Ahh, yeah. That's much better.  I can't keep doing this. It's killing me. I'm serious! I'm not gonna make it. It's over, children. I couldn't raise the $2 million to hire Johnnie Cochran. Now I have to go to jail. Huh? Did what?! Wow! How much did you make?  Oh. I made about $410,300, but-- Goodbye, children. Thanks for all your help. Ow! What the hell did you do that for?! Ow! Ow! You finally snapped, huh, Garrison? Don't you get it, Garrison? It's all you! You're Mr. Hat and Mr. Twig! You've got split personality schizophrenic jeebies. What?! No, Garrison! Shut the hell up! What the? How the hell did he reach the gas pedal? What the hell is this? Mr. Hat busted me out. Children, did you do this? I don’t believe it! You will? It feels great! I just can't find the words to thank all the artists who put on Chef Aid. And most of all, I want to thank the children. Get back to what's important. It's Tuesday. And means tomorrow is tuna casserole day.  All ready for our Halloween lunch? Today I've got spooooooky spaghetti, with freeeeeaky French fries. Or haaauuunted hash browns. And a creeeeeepy cookie, and moooooonstrous milk! And a ''teeeeerrifying napkin!'' What?! Well, what's the first problem? Oh. Well, uh, don't worry, Stan. I'm sure it'll work out. Now, what's the other problem?  Oh, DEAR GOD, NO! Exactly what do you remember? Of course! That's it! Don't you see, children? ''This'' Cartman is from an evil, parallel universe where everything exists as its opposite! Children, somewhere in South Park, something has created a door to the evil, parallel universe! How do you mean? Oh my God, look! Hmmm... That's a good question, Mayor. Let me get right on that with thinking. Hey, I thought of something.  Uh... no, wait, that's subtraction. Whoa, this is a good movie! Yeah, I'm gettin' hungry, too.  Wooo! The short what? Yes, but at what cost, Mr. Garrison? At what cost? Well, being an officer of the peace means a lot of things. It's a hard job, but then I'm a hard man. A lot of people think that in a small town there isn't a lot for the law to do. Well, they're wrong. There, you see? This could be a bank robbery. Or possibly even a murder! This ain't no Podunk little town! Goddammit! Okay, people, move along. There's nothing to see here.  What's the trouble? Where's the body? Uhhhh... oh. Uhh, boys, you move along. This isn't for young eyes to see.  Did you get a good look at the suspect? Wellll uh, this is quite interesting, huh, guys? Haw, camel poo. Give me that!  That's a clue, and you'll get your stinking DNA all over it! Uhh... It says, uuh, "Sorry I had sex with the chicken. I won't do it again. Bye-bye." Well, there you have it. Case closed. I said, return to your homes before I start arresting people. How about fishing without a license? Whataya call this then? If you do not comply, I'll be forced to execute each and every one of you...  by gunshot to the head. That's right, return to your simple lives.  Just forget this ever happened. Forget. ''For''-get. Uhhh, just give me two cheeseburgers and some jalapeño poppers. What's that? I know that, smarty-pants! What do you think, I'm some kinda idiot? Hmmm.  I can't go on living this lie! Well, nobody can say for sure; uh, no motive has yet been established. Well, both 3D computer modeling and intensive seismology have not given us any leads as of yet. All right, all right! I can't read! There, I said it! I can't read! Are you happy now? You pushed and you pushed, and now you all know my terrible secret! I'm illegitimate! I'm not fit to be a policeman! I retire! I need to go poopies. Oh, Christ. How do you kids do it? Ahhh... O... O-- Ahhh... O...  Did you kids actually learn how to read this way? Haa haa. Ha ha ha. I've just finished reading the heartwarming novel, ''Go, Dog. Go!''. I found it a compelling and disturbing look at the canine psyche. If I may read a passage: "Big... dog..., little... dog.  A red dog... on a..." Well, anyway, I'm not one to give away the ending, but I will say that it spirals toward an incredible twist-turn that parallels my own life.  Hooray! <poem><i>Swingset, swingset, up and down I go...</i></poem>  Oooh, pretty good. Ah, Mayor, please, when we're around children we prefer to call him the Chicken''lover''. Who? Carla Weathers or the chicken? Oh, I can't read this. It has silent e's. I'm doing the best I can. I even got a A on my book report. Oh boy, I'm in big trouble. I'll never learn to read fast enough, and the town is in chaos. Hey, that's right. You ''can'' help me. Under article 39, section 2 of police code, I'm allowed to deputize citizens in a time of crisis. You boys will be my deputies; you can help me restore order, catch the Chickenlover, and swing me on the swingset. Sure, nightsticks for everybody! You keep a tab on crime in the city, and we'll try to solve the Chickenlover case. Now, what did that clue say again? To the Booktastic bus, deputies! We haven't a moment to spare! We need a copy of ''Bumbly Wumbly and the Spotted Spacecraft'' right away! Aw, just give us the damn book, fruitcake! It says, "Mmmuh mmmuuh..." Uh, what's this word?  Oh, yeah. "I... mmuh mmuh--" That's quick thinking, deputy. Let's get to Stark's Pond immediately! Oh, weak, dude! We're too late! Come on, dudes. We need to look for another clue.   "Tee-tle the timid taxidermist... loves..to..." Oh, goddamn, reading is lame! Terrible! I give up! I'm not fit to be a cop! Booohoohoohoohoo, booohoohoohoohoo. It is, too! "Teetle the timid taxidermist loves to go to the pet-pet--" "Pet--" Wait a minute.  Pet-ting. Petting zoo. He loved to go to the petting zoo! Boys, we're off! Keep your eyes peeled, boys. Somebody's gonna make love to this chicken any minute. Oh, no! Shhh! Keep your eyes peeled. Grab him! I knew it was you all along, Richard Nixon! Oh. Caught you red-handed! By reading ''Teetle the Timid Taxidermist''. Well, I guess I should say "Thanks?" No, no, that's ''not'' how you uphold the law!  Thank you, everybody. Thank you.  What? Oh. Okay, uh... Well, first of all I'd like to thank the town of South Park, the town that bore me and eventually will rob me of my life precious. Second, I'd like to say to all those out there who think they can screw chickens just to teach people to read, your days are numbered!  reading totally sucks ass! Yes, at first, I was happy to be learning how to read. It seemed exciting and magical. But then I read this: ''Atlas Shrugged'', by Ayn Rand. I read every last word of this garbage, and because of this piece of sh-shit, I'm never reading again!  Thanks, boys.  I'm sorry, Mayor, but I couldn't find the little man in the boat. Oh?  Oh, I like snakes. You light 'em and they grow and grow. I found him. Let's move along, people. If you've seen one giant snake-thingy firework, you've seen them all. That's a pretty far-fetched story, boys. Are you boys sure you're not just making this all up? Well, just as soon as I handle all the other crime in South Park, I'm gonna go with you to the planetarium so I can prove that nothing's wrong. Oh, yeah. Let's go. Hello, Mr. Planetarium Operator. Well, these boys seem to think you're some kind of sick weirdo that's got a master plan to screw with the minds of everyone in town. Yeah. I just thought I'd come show them around so they'd know there's nothing to be scared of. Okay, I'll be quick, then. Well, it's nice to see you finally got a real job, Chef. Oh I know what you mean. I've always loved the planetarium, too. That would be super-duper! Oh, neato! Who? Pain.  Wuzzariah? Ulduhooyah? Guh. Ahoohooyuh?  Holdjit If you wouldn't mind, uugh. Could you please follow me?  Odle-oh who whoo?  Not so fast there, tubby. Uh I'm just takin' care of business.  Oh, thank you from a fate worse than death, counselor. What's all the hoo-ha? Why? If that is true, then your declaration of Shenanigans is just. What do you have to say, carnival operator? Young man, you can't just go declaring Shenanigans on innocent people! That's how wars get started! Barbrady! You said Buttbaby. Oh, I think maybe you'll answer that downtown, tourists. What's all this? Ho-kay okay, let's calm down. People of South Park, do you declare Shenanigans on the carnival people? Okay, carnival people, do you accept this decree of Shenanigans? Well, that settles it! Everybody grab a broom, it's Shenanigans! All right, you damned carnival people. Into jail with-  Oooooh?  Yeah. Uh me, too. I didn't? Ooh, phew, I feel a lot better, then, although I could've swore that I had heard of them and they starved to death in my prison. What's this all about? Can I go now?  Weirdo. Well, there's been a report of a few missing people. Yeah. No biggie, but I was wondering if you had seen any of them.  No, I didn't think so. Mind if I look around the back yard, though? Well, I'm checking everyone's back yards. Missing people usually turn up hiding in someone's bushes. May I?   Okay, Mrs. Marsh, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you a few questions. Hello, Mr. Marsh. Top of the evening to you.  Okay, bye, then. Oh, I understand. I remember when my wife stopped getting her monthly visitor. No. Just leave me with my dignity.  Okay, people, move along. Nothing to see here. The usual. Stand back, people. There's nothing to see here. Oh, yeah. There is that.   Hello, children. Dr. Mephesto needs one of you to help him out in his lab with the prehistoric ice man. All right, there's only one fair way to do this. Everyone stick out their potatoes.  B L O O uh oh-O spells "blue" and that means that you will go to the lab and help out Mephesto and then we can all go home and watch ''Murphy Brown''.  (Oh my God, they killed Mephesto!) (Huh?) (This is Team B.) (Are you fuckin' telling me that I could've fuckin' gone that way?!) (Yup! I see it in the drift.) (Okay, I've reached the generator) (Roger.) (Negative.) (I'll stick 'em together) (Goodbbyyyyee-ugh!) (There's a lot of fuckin' vaginas and penises.) (Hey, what's that?) (Daaarrrggghh--) (-ooggghhh...) (Hey.) (Hi, Cartman.)  (Oh, it was only my jacket.) (Ow!) (Ooh, the ''penis''!) (Run, dude!) (Hey!) (Hey, you guys! I'm dy--) (Sheesh!) (Just face it, dude, your uncle's stupid!) (Yeah, it's like killing a dead pig and a turkey.) (Nononono-yikes!)  (OW! OW! DUDE, PLEASE STOP!! OH, FUCK! YIKES!!!!!)  (Huh?) (Almost 7:30.) (Hey you guys. Remember when ''Terrance and Phillip'' was off the air?) (All I know is that it was a loong time ago, and Death was chasing us on a bicycle down the street.) (Heheheh. Now that's what I-he call a sticky situation!) (Oh, yeah.)  (Uh oh. Hey uh, you guys! Help me doooowwwwnnnn! Heeyy, you guuuuyyyyys!) (''Waarrggh!!'') (Dude! You guys, I really, really don't have time to tell you that-- Argghh..!) (Yeah, that's because you vomit on her all the time.) (Cartman's ass is so fuckin' huge that they could probably show six stupid films on it and still have some room, heheheheheh.) (Wait!) (No, Mom, I'm seriously sick!)  (Hey you guys, what's goin' on?) (Aa-choo!)  (Waa-choo!) (Uh-huh.) (Well, there's gonna be a bunch of rats until they put the freakin' ceiling in.) (Aa-choo!) (Okay. Got to have some huggin'.) (I don't see anything.) (Whoa, dude.) (Heellp!!) (Fine!) (Well, why the fuck do I have to do everything while you stand around in the snow lookin--)  (Uh--) (You suck ass and you suck dick!)  (Yes, sir..!) (Uh huh) (Yeah!) (Well, why do I have to be the one to go and find chicks?)  (Uh-huh) (Huh?)  (What? These?) (Nuh uh.) (Dude, these are my fucking food stamps! How am I going to eat without all these food stamps?) (Oh my God, they've killed Cartman!) (I don't know where he went!) (Okay.) (I don't know, can't find him.) (I know, I know!) (Huh-uh, I ain't gonna get inside that ring! Aaah!) (All right dude, let me go now!) (Give me that-!)  (Ow, mom!) (Uh huh.) (Uh huh!) (It's the only thing I could afford.) (Okay.) (Okay)   (Hey, you guys. I'm right here.) (Fuck you!) (Let me try! Let me try!) ''[dropping from the top] (In my family, it's a silly enterprise.)'' (Oh, no!)  (He actually killed it!) (You bastard!) (Well, I think you guys should name it Steve.) (Blue.)  (Uh oh. Ow!) You bastards!  He's bleeding pretty bad back here. What's a Meredith Baxter-Birney memorial towel? Man, it's really starting to snow. I hope they don't close the roads. Maybe it's better you ''don't'' know who your father is, Cartman. Really? <poem><i>I'm sailing away...</i></poem> <poem><i>Set an open course for the virgin sea...</i></poem> ''Whoa'', dude! Come on, Stan. Hospitals aren't all that bad. Whoa, dude! She doesn't have any arms! Stan! Hey, Cartman. <poem><i>I'm sailing ay...</i></poem>  I don't know if that's gonna be too easy. Duhuhude! You barfed into the incision! D'you have any wire here? No, he'll die! You bastard! He was very brave. He risked his life so that Mephesto could live. I don't know. Let's find out. Boring. Boring. Gay. Boring. Boring. Wow, these books look cool! Who are you? Yeah, this is stupid! Books aren't magical. It looks like a note. Wow. Barbrady sure is acting weird. Whoa, dude, what's going on? How about a brain transplant? Yeah, isn't he just supposed to be learning how to read? Oh no!. What's it say? Here, give me that.  "I am Bumbly Wumbly. I live in the pond." Here! Here, I found one! It says, "Read ''Teetle the Timid Ta-- Taa-- The Taxi--''" What's this word? How's it goin', dude? Just read the sentence. Come on, dumbass, you can do it! Yeah, maybe you read it wrong. He's here! Whoa, dude! It's the bookmobile driver! So you fucked a bunch of chickens? Cartman! Well, he is. It turns out that the bookmobile driver here was the one making love to chickens. Whoa, dude! I guess you should leave police work to the professionals, huh, Cartman? Wow! I guess reading really ''does'' suck ass! It's poetic justice.  We won't let it happen again, Mr. Mackey, m'kay? Hey, are you guys gonna come to Ike's party this weekend? No, it's his bris. I don't know. But there's gonna be lots of food, and a band. Uhhh... I'm not sure. Why did they search ''us''? That marijawana never even ''made'' it to us. How's it going? Why bad? Because they're an addictive solution to a greater problem, causing disease of both body and mind with consequences far outweighing their supposed benefits. No. Hey, are you going to come to Ike's bris this weekend? No, not ham, you fat fuck! Your heart? Hey, wait! Stop who? What? Chop off his wee wee?! Are you sure?! That can't be true! My parents wouldn't do that! I won't believe it! I ''won't''! I have to ask my mom and dad! Mom! Dad! Mom, Dad, what exactly are this party for? Meaning what? AAAAAGGGGGHHHHH!!!!! I can't believe my parents are cannibals! I have to save my little brother! I have to send him away until my parents come to their senses! Come on, Ike! Cover me for a while. I'll find a place to hide him and come back. Just give me 30 minutes. Come on, Ike! Come on, Ike, hurry up!  Where is the next train going? You wanna go to Nebraska, Ike? I need one ticket for my little brother. Huh? But my parents are gonna cut off his ding-dong! They've just gone crazy for a while. Please, mister, I have to hide my brother until they come to their senses. Dammit! Ike, if you wanna keep your penis, you have to get on this train. Ready, Ike? Kick the baby! Goodbye, Ike! Be safe! I'll come find you in Nebraska when Mom and Dad are back to normal! There, what do you think? I'm making a dummy Ike doll. My parents think he's out with me right now, and I have to bring him back for dinner. Not when  if I say he's sick and put him to bed right away. No, go away! Bad dog! I used a bunch of bones from the butcher shop. Anyways, I need you guys to help me so that my parents don't realize Ike is gone. Knock it off, asshole! Sorry, Mom. I just had to deal with Ike. He-he's been cranky.  Ah, I'm gonna take him up to the bathroom to get washed up. No, Mom-uh, he, he doesn't want you kissing him. Put him down, you stupid dog! Hey, wait a minute. How come Ike's tombstone has the Canadian flag on it? What?? You mean to tell me that all this time I've been trying to protect Ike from having his fireman cut off, and he's not even my real brother?! Dude, Ike isn't dead. He's in Nebraska! Ooh, who the hell cares? He's not even my responsibility.  You bastards. Aw, how the hell should I know?  All the time: "Look out for your little brother, Kyle!", "Take care of your little brother, Kyle", and he wasn't even really my little brother. Yeah, right.  He's ''not'' my brother!  I'm sorry, Ike. What do you want?! Ohhh, no you don't. That isn't gonna work on ''me'', Canadian! No way! There's no real connection between us. It was all a big lie. Go on, Canadian! Beat it! I'm through getting in trouble for you! You stay away from my little brother! ''You'' aren't gonna cut off his wee wee. ''Not today'', you sick-ass weirdo! And ''you!'' You should be ashamed of yourself! Don't you understand that us males are defined by our firemen?! No! No, it isn't true! It's okay, Ike. I'm here.  Yeah. You know, I've learned something today. Family isn't about whose blood you have, it's about who you care about. And that's why I feel like ''you'' guys are ''more'' than just friends. You're my family.  Except for Cartman. M'kay? We don't wanna play dodgeball. It hurts. No it isn't, it hurts! I can't believe they let us play this in school. Dammit, we lost one already! I caught it! I caught it! Here, Pip, ''you'' throw. Come on, limey, don't be a wuss! Are you just gonna be a little French pansy your whole life? Throw the ball, you stupid frog! Goddamn, maybe if you didn't eat all those croissants, you'd be able to-- Ow! . Ow, my nose! You broke my nose!  No. No, it'll be okay! Oh-- Noooo! Ye-yes. Ye-yes. I know. Oh! Phew. Aw, I just hit my nose playing dodgeball. AAGGGGGHHHH!! OOOOOHHHHH MY GOD!! '''''AAAARRRRGGGGGGHHHHH!!!''''' ...And when she moved up and down, the little fetus jiggled. No. No-it looked dead. Dude, where is she gonna get fetus clothes? And then she walked over to-- Uhhhh... Yeah. Can't we just play with that big parachute again or something? Hey, Pip. Do you wanna be on my team again? Go for it, Pip. Come on, you Frenchy little frog! Get him, Frenchy! Some hadka fish, some gafagga... Wow, that was easy. Hey, why did you guys forfeit? Know what? But we could get killed! Dude, what does that mean? Yeah, you're from China. But Chef, you just ripped on Chinese people.  You... bastards... What the hell is everyone wearing on their heads? Agghh! Well sorry, dude, we weren't here. Hey, you know, that nurse is actually pretty cool. Mr. Garrison, were you in Vietnam? Hey, yeah! He and Ned do that stupid TV show. Cartman! What kind of stupid-ass question is that?! Of course it was fun! Are there any questions? Yes, Mr. Garrison? F-minus? Can he do that? How do you know? You weren't even there. Yeah, dude, your Uncle Jimbo sucks ass!  We've got to get him back, dude. Well, he screwed us by makin' something up; I say we do the same thing. Did you guys ever see that one ''Brady Bunch'' where the guy...  Dude, I can't believe they fell for it! Come on! We've gotta make another one!  Der, Cartman! Just do it again, Cartman, and don't make it talk!  'Cause old ladies are fat and you are, too! Dude, they're gonna look so stupid. Look! Yeah, we made the whole thing up. It was all just a really, really funny joke!  Aw, come on. Ned's faking it. That frog was just a piece of ''plastic!'' Who are you? You bastards! Yeah! Then she told us to throw a chair at Ned! Yeah. And we're sorry for turning Ned into a vegetable. Wait a sec. Where ''is'' your producer? Come on, fatass! You shouldn't be eating all that cake anyway! Whoa, dude. The road is really snowy out there. I know, but, it's really snowy today. Oh, she would, dude. She would. Dammit, Cartman, you are such a fat fuck! I'm scared! Yeah, what are we supposed to do? 'Cause, dombass, scary monsters don't eat big fat smelly bitches! I said, 'Larry King won't grant me three wishes.' We couldn't get trapped here ''forever'', Cartman. We'd die after a couple of days. What? Worse than this? You can say that again. Nope. Calm down, dude. You're upsetting Kenny. Don't do it, kid. Holy crap, dude! On Wednesday or Thursday? Aw man, I don't think it's very safe to be on this bus. Hey. Maybe it's that thing, Scuzzlebutt.  Don't you remember? That time we were out hunting with your uncle Jimbo and Ned. Now, that's what ''I'' call a sticky situation. Don't be stupid, Cartman. Our teacher wouldn't be out lying in the forest waiting to kill us! What was ''what?'' What could it be? If only we knew what we were up against. Hey yeah, I remember that. Well, who really cares what that monster is outside? As long as we stay on the bus, it can't hurt us. Right? You bastard! We've just gotta stick together. Yeah, dude! Kenny just died eight hours ago from that monster! How could he have died back then, too? What are we gonna do? There.  I think we got it. Don't worry. Everything's gonna work out. It always does. Sure. Remember that time that that kid in the red shirt decided to go off on his own? Now, that's what I call a sticky situation. Hey. Ms. Crabtree had that little TV, for the trainng video? Maybe we can watch TV on ''it''.  Du-hude! Your dad's a retard! Wait a minute. I though your father was your ''mother'' 'cause she had a penis. Oh no!  Hello? Really? Dude. That's a pretty fucked up dream. Hey. Me and Cartman and Kenny are going down to Happy Burger. Do you wanna come? What do you mean? I saved up enough to buy M-80s this year. Cool! Maybe we can do that to Cartman's cat. We wanna buy M-80s. What a baby. What do ya mean? Dude! Just 'cause some stupid North Park kid blew his hands off, we don't get to buy M-80s? Yeah. We've been playing with firecrackers our whole lives. Yeah, now what are we supposed to do? Dude, what are we supposed to do? We always just play with fireworks. Yeah! Let's go, dude. We're ready. Yeah. Your fat ass isn't on the sled! Didn't you hear? They outlawed fireworks 'cause a little boy blew off his hands. <poem><i>Dusty the dirtball...</i></poem> Hey, look, it's Mr. Garrison. Hey, have you found Mr. Hat yet? Yup. Yeah, Cartman, you're swimming around in first-grader pee.  Yeah, the Fat Ass Olympics. Dude, it's Cartman. He's just being a dumb-ass like always. Like a..big hunk of dirt with a carrot sticking out of it. I heard you won't even get in the deep end.  Dude! That thing is huge! Kenny! Watch out! You bastard! What should we do, dude? That big snake keeps growing; it's gonna demolish the whole state soon! What'd he say? How is that gonna help? A lot, I think. I don't think it matters, dude. This giant snake is gonna kill everyone soon. We're bored. Wow! These are huge! Hey, look! It's snowing! Mr. Garrison, where's Mr. Hat? They're not gonna show that stupid-ass Godzilla movie again, are they? Sick, Kenny. All this for a bunch of stupid movies? Cool! If she holds his hand in that theater it'll be all over. I'm poopies, ma! <poem><i>Gone are the dark clouds that had me-</i></poem> Could it be? Mr. Hankey? Mr. Hankey, is that you? Hello? It was him, dude. I ''told'' you, it was Mr. Hankey! Well, I'm ''sure'' it was him. So how was that movie last night, dude? Maybe they should project the movies on Cartman's ass. Well? There it is again! It's Mr. Hankey! I think he's in some kind of trouble. Where does that grill go? Of course, the sewer! That must be where he is. Come on! Come on! Of ''course'' it smells like ass, retard. It's a sewer! We can't, dude. Not until we find Mr. Hankey. What the hell? In a sewer? Yeah, we're the Goonies, Cartman. Why don't ''you'' pretend like you're the fat kid? Mr. Hankey! I ''told'' you guys he'd be here! What's the matter, Mr. Hankey? Are you sick? And that's why you got a cold? Don't worry, Mr. Hankey. We'll go tell everyone. Come on, guys.  Wait! Stop! Could I have your attention, please? Aaahh! Ladies and gentlemen, my best friend, Mr. Hankey, is getting sick because South Park has become overcrowded with people who eat health food. He's a talking piece of poo that lives in the sewer. But now he's getting sick because his egosystem is all out of whack because of all the extra poo in the sewer. If you don't all leave and go home soon, Mr. Hankey's gonna die. He's one of my best friends in the whole wide world, and I don't want him to die. Huh?? Dude, no one even listened to me. Mr. Hankey! Mr. Hankey?! Mr. Hankey? They didn't believe me. They thought I was pitching a movie.  We only have one option. I've gotta take you to the surface. It's the only way to prove to them that you're real. Well, you're not gonna last down here either, Mr. Hankey. Now, come on! I'm not gonna let you die! Mph. Okay, Mr. Hankey. We're out. How are you doin'? Don't worry. We'll do this quick, okay? Just hang on, Mr. Hankey, just hang on! You guys, we have to hurry! Come on! Everything's gonna be okay! Sir! Sir! I have to show you something. I think it will change the way you feel about your impact here. I want you guys to all meet my friend. You ''can't'' die, Mr. Hankey. You ''can't''. Well-. Huwhat is it, Mr. Hankey? Nooohohohohohoho- What is it, Mr. Hankey? What is it? Yes? Nooo! Nooo!  Noo! ''No!'' Uuf. I'll never forget you. You were my best friend after Stan. Chef, does poo go to heaven?  Mr. Hankey? He's back! He's back!  You've got the best balls in the whole world, Chef. Wait! I brought him! I brought him to show you! Behold! Mr. Hankey! No!  O-hoho he's dead. Mr. Hankey's dead. I don't know. You did it, Mr. Hankey. You got rid of all the film people! Are you guys having a meeting or something? Yeah. Let's just have a slumber party here. I wonder why our moms want us to sleep over at Kenny's so bad. Well, all I can say is, he's better have Nintendo. Well, here's Kenny's house. Heheheh, buns. Oh my God. This is like a third-world country. I don't know. Come on! Let's just get in our sleeping bags and get this night over with. Cartman, what the hell is that? ''No'', it's not cool! Yeah. I feel great! Yeah, dude. I ''told'' you, we had bread sandwiches for breakfast. Yes. Why? No way, dude! It sucked ass! They don't even have cable! Kenny's not really my friend, Ma. I don't give a rat's ass about him. Aawwww! Hey Dad. Is it true that you and Kenny's dad used to be best friends when you were young? Well how come Kenny's family eats frozen waffles for dinner and has rats on the floor, and we have a big house and lots of food? But ''why?'' If they're hungry and poor, why don't we just always give them half of ''our'' food? Gods and clods? Oooohh, I see. Gods and clods! Could we go home now, Ma? But we've been playing for eight hours. We can't think of anything else to do. What's "ookie mouth"? Sick, dude! Ookie mouth!  Gross! I can't do it, Ma! Argh! I can't say "ookie mouth" and have Kenny spit down my throat at the same time. It's impossible. What the hell does that have to do with American history? Mr. Garrison, I'm the only one here. Everyone else has chicken herpes. What?! Does everybody have to do it, or just me? "So this is how America works. We have gods and clods. My dad says America needs both rich and poor to survive, but I have a better idea."  What?  Oh my God!  You! You! You sent us over to Kenny's house on ''purpose!'' You ''wanted'' us to get sick! Why?! So I could be sitting in the hospital waiting to die, like Stan?! You get away from me, you crazy woman!  Stan! Stan!  Sorry, sorry. You know how after we spent the night at Kenny's house and-and you and Cartman got sick with chickenpox? Dude! Our parents sent us over there to ''get'' us sick! They knew that staying at Kenny's house would get us sick, and they made us do it anyway. Yeah. And I think I figured out why. Because they're a bunch of assholes. Come on, dude. We've gotta get out of here. I don't know what they're planning next, but it can't be good! Cartman, do you remember how we all spent the night at Kenny's a couple of days ago? Yeah, dude. Your mom ''wanted'' you to have herpes on your face. No-no-no-no. Come on, fatass, we're gonna get 'em ''all'' back. Chef, we wanna know about herpes. Well I don't know. You're just the only grownup we trust. Do you know anybody with herpes? Cool! Thanks, Chef! Are you old Frida? Someone who wants a favor.  Huh? Damn, you sound pretty sick. Maybe you should go back to the hospital. D-hude, this is gonna be so killer. They're ''all'' gonna get herpes! Aw, man.  I don't feel so good. Ugh... We're sorry. This itches! Give me some of that calamine lotion, Cartman. I'm better now. We gave you guys herpes. You bastards! Mr. Garrison, we've been watching ''Barnaby Jones'' repeats for eight days now. It's hard to keep paying attention. To where? Yeah, all the constellations look alike. You couldn't get both arms behind your back, fatass! I thought it was planetarium. Hey, who are you?  Whoopie. Oh, man, I don't feel so good. Me too. It was sweet. Did what? My head still feels funny. Like you really need it, hippo-ass! Whoa, dude! Who the hell are you?! Mr. Garrison, since haiku sucks so much ass, could we go to the planetarium again? I dunno. I just have this sudden urge to go back. What do you mean? Sshh! Why? Oh, yeah. Here's the control panel that operates all the stars. You see? Nothing, dude. Just a bunch of stars. What does that do? Kenny! What's it doing? We're bastards! We've gotta go tell somebody, quick! But it's true, dude! Don't do it, Officer Barbrady! He's not highly intelligent.  Cartman! You saved us! He got a full dose of the stars. Can you imagine it, Stan. A mind, emptied by that... thing. Yeah! You're dead! Dude! Every time we play Americans vs. Bosnians, you cheat! Well? Now what are we going to do? I dunno. Okay. We do? Whoa, dude. Your dad is watching ''Terrance and Phillip''. Whoa, dude! Wow, cartoons are getting really dirty! Yeah. Hey Stan, what did your dad mean when he said we're gonna play Truth or Dare? Dude, what kind of sick joke is that? Girls suck ass. What? Why? Hey yeah! That'd be sweet! We could totally ruin their lives! It's not lame, it's sweet! After we build this clubhouse, we're gonna get girls to play Truth or Dare! Because, dumbass, we can dare them to do gross stuff and make them cry! What? Were you born yesterday? Fine! Fine! Fine! When is Mr. Hat coming back? When is Mr. Hat coming back? Good guess, dude! Dude! Where have you been? I've been waiting all afternoon. To me?? We should use nails, dude. Hey, Stan. Do you know how to play Truth or Dare? Well dude, how the hell are we supposed to play it, then?  Dude, I don't think this is very sturdy. Okay. Stan, if I didn't know you better, I would almost think you're doing this because you wanna play with girls. Right. Why? Too eager to what? Okay. Yeah? Umm. Dare? What? What?!! Sick, dude, I'm not kissing a girl! It's just wrong, that's all. What the hell have you gotten me into?! Hoh boy. Sick! Aggghhh! Fucking sickening! Okay. Huh? Okay, that's fine.  But I don't care. You bastard! Wow, dude, check it out! We can win Terrance and Phillip dolls. Yeah, they look like cheap rip-offs. Dude, that kicks ass! You suck, Cartman! Give me that! Hey! It hit her right in the mouth! But ih- Here, give me some money, Cartman! Lend me money, fat boy! Damn it! Come on! I'll try to get more money from my mom. Mom, give me some money! I need $17 so we can win Terrance and Phillip dolls. I will if you give me money! Okay. We've got $15 between us. That means we get nine balls to throw. Is it like a- haunted house or something? No. We can't, dude. We have to win the Terrance and Phillip dolls. You'd better be right, dude. Okay. That was the dumbest ride I've ever seen! That was a waste of money, Cartman! We can't. We're saving our money for the balls in Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth game. This ride better be good! We'd better be. We've been in line for almost an hour! Finally! Yeah. Ugh. You've gotta be kidding me! Well, Cartman, this is just my opinion, but I think the Line Ride sucked donkey balls! You dumbass, Cartman! No, it's not cool! How much do we have left, Cartman? How much do we have left, Cartman?! What?! You said we had plenty of money, Cartman! You son of a bitch! Aaargh! Well, Cartman, thanks to you we don't have any money left to win the Terrance and Phillip dolls! Well, sorry's not good enough! What are you gonna do about it? Give him your food stamps, Kenny! Come on, dude! I can do it! I'm sure! Okay. Here we go. Hey! That was right on target. That does it! Shenanigans! SHENANIGANS! I'm declaring Shenanigans on you! This game is rigged! Officer Barbrady, I wanna declare Shenanigans on this carnival operator. This game is fixed! The balls are bigger than Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth! It worked! No! Dude! I want the Terrance and Phillip dolls up there. What?! You dirty son of a bitch, you never told us that we had to win- Damnit, I have to have those dolls!  Wait a minute! I've got it! The bull-riding contest. Cartman could ride a bull, and try to win $5,000. Think about it, dude: $5,000. That's 1,000 set of balls. That's 3,000 balls! We'd have to win enough to get the dolls!  Because you spent all of our money on those stupid rides, fatass! Now, either you're getting on a bull or I'm gonna break your fucking head open! All right! Now, come on! We have to practice! You gotta try and stay on for ten seconds. Okay, Cartman? That wasn't quite ten seconds. Get back on, fat-ass! You have to practice! What'd you say, Cartman?? I think he said he wants to practice on a real bull. Well uh, he'll have to do. Cartman has to get some practice with a real bull. Okay, Cartman. You ready? Open the gate!  That bull sucks! He's not even bucking or anything! Hit the bull in the balls with a snowball. That's better. Get up, Cartman! You're still not staying on long enough! No he didn't kill him, he's still breathing! Get up! Get UP! Dude, I think we broke him. ..Oh. We need him to win a bull-riding contest so we can get Terrance and Phillip dolls. Can he still do it? Damn it! You think? He still thinks he's a Vietnamese prostitute. Yeah, I think so. Hey, where's Cartman? He's up in, like, twenty minutes! Don't be nervous, Cartman. This is gonna be cake. What do you mean? Hang on, Cartman! Go help him, Kenny! You bastards! How many ball does that get us? You will? We did it! You see, Cartman? You won us the Terrance and Phillip dolls! What are we gonna do with them? ..What the-? After all that?! Shenanigans! Shenanigans! SHENANIGANS! Officer Barbrady, I would like to reinstate my previous Shenanigans! This whole carnival is a rip-off!  Oh. Good idea, Phillip. Let's look for treasuh. Really? What about? No! Cartman, that was just a dream! What the hell are you singing, Cartman? When is Mr. Hat coming back? He'd be better used as a coat rack. He singing some new hit song. Wow, then you should get money for it! Then we should go to the record company. My dad's a lawyer, dude; he tells me about this stuff all the time. It’s the same goddamn song! We’ll get my dad to be Chef’s lawyer! I don't know. I'm sure that would scare the hell out of him, Cartman. What's going on? Yeah. Ready, Cartman? What's that, dude? Did you ever know any famous people? You can raise $2 million, dude. We'll help you. Yeah, b-but how? Whoa, dude, this house is huge. Are you Elton John? Oh. Then what the hell are we talking to you for? Come on, guys. Hi, are you Elton John? We're trying to raise money for our school chef. Yeah, dude. Dude, we'll have Chef's $2 million in no time! He’s not dying, Cartman! Yeah. Do you know him? Gosh, thanks, Rick James. We went to a bunch of rock stars and sold them candy bars to raise the money you needed. Cartman? But we can put our money together with the money you made whoring yourself to all the women. How much did you make? Dude... Chef is gone. But what are we gonna do? Chef Aid? Hey, that's a great idea! Hmm... This isn't going over so well. Wow, cool! We are raising money so that Chef can hire Johnnie Cochran to sue you! Well, we helped. You bastard! Hey, that's your song for Wendy! He probably just ditched to avoid that spelling test. Uh, nice costume, dude. Who are you supposed to be? Luke Perry? Did you eat too many pork rinds last night? What the hell are you talking about, Cartman?! Where have you been, dude? Aunt Flo? Where is Cartman? He said he was gonna bring money for us to buy a pumpkin. Here he comes. ''You'' said you could get us money, Cartman! Well, at least he's back to normal. It's okay. Kenny said ''he'd'' get one. That's not cool! It's about time, Kenny! Did you bring the pumpkin? Stop saying "hella," Cartman!  Whoa, Stan. You don't look so good. ''God, will you shut up?!'' Yeah. I don't know.  Oh, great. He's got that stupid beard on again. You seem tired, Stan. Why? Hoh, that sucks, dude. Cartman? You ''can't'' be standing there, Cartman. Because you're standing over ''there''! Uh, Chef? Chef. Chef. Chef! We have problems! Will you stop saying that word?! Whoa! What's wrong with your head?! Why are you shaking like that? Dude. Are you sure that fish is a murderer? It seemed like a normal fish to me. There can't be ''that'' many pet stores in South Park, dude.  Well, we'd better get working. Cartman, you go home and call all the pet stores in the phone book. What? Dude, why is your store called "The Indian Burial Ground Pet Store?" Like what? You kick ass, evil Cartman! You know what I like best about you? You don't say, "hella," like ''our'' Cartman does. I swear, if he says that one more time, I'm gonna ''kill'' him!  Hey, yeah! I almost forgot. Yeah, you're cool. And you don't say "hella." Dude, where are we going to find a pumpkin to carve? ''Stop saying "hella," Cartman!'' Leave him alone, butthole! It's the evil pets  We can't deal with you saying "hella" anymore, Cartman! You're going to the other universe!  Which one is the ''good'' Cartman? Yeah! Now, which one of you is the Cartman we can't stand?! Oh no, dude! Damn it! That's nice, Cartman. Oh my God! What the hell are we gonna do for six hours? Please stop.  Please stop! What's all ''that'' stuff? Hey, look!  See Mr. Hankey at the Mall of Nebraska... Wow! We ''have'' to ''go'', dude!  I don't know. Ever since he was in that movie, he got all famous. It doesn't matter. He'll be most excited to meet ''me''! Cool! Oh, God!  Jesus Christ, finally! Agghh!  That was totally gross. She smelled like vitamins and pee. Dude, your family died? What?! What is this??  Sick, dude! Whoa, dude!   Aaww!  I know what you mean.   Dude, I was having this horrible nightmare that we were at this house, and it was filled with Cartmans! Oh. Arrggh!  I heard it, too.  I wanted to make sure, too. Dude, it's coming through the window!  We have to go see Mr. Hankey at the mall, Cartman. Yeah, they do! Dude, we ''have'' to get to the mall!! Good for you, Charlie!  Do you see him? I can't wait to see him!  He's gonna be so glad we came! That's nice, kid. I knew Mr. Hankey before he was even famous. So?! Dude, Mr. Hankey has magic powers. He can do whatever he wants.   Hoh, boy. Here we go! You're not the real Mr. Hankey. This is ''not'' Mr. Hankey!  Why are you people doing this? Why would you lie like this? To ''children''?  What?! What did you say?!  Behold! Here's your false prophet! It was a fake! Cartman was right! The holiday season is for idiots! I can't believe they would put a fake Mr. Hankey in a mall! If Mr. Hankey ever found out, he'd be so pissed! God, I ''hate'' the holiday season!  What's your mom doing here, dude?  Charlie's right! I'm not gonna let some ''fake'' Mr. Hankey spoil ''my'' holidays. Yeah. We don't ''wanna'' be in a group with Tweek.  No, Cartman, we can't do it on Raymond again! It has to be on a current event in South Park. Tweek, do you have any ideas? Dude, that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Dude, we can't do a presentation on underpants gnomes. Mr. Garrison will fail us because you're making it up. We're his oral report buddies. Coffee? I don't think I like coffee. We're already doing a paper on Tweek's underpants gnomes. Come on, you guys! We better get to work! ''Man'', this stuff is strong.  Don't worry about it. Well, let's just try to finish all this coffee, so we can stay up. Woohoo! Totally, dudes! I feel awesome! Hey, Tweek, you got anymore of this stuff? Killer!!  Gross, Cartman. Whoopee! Hogh, my stomach hurts.  Well, it's 3:30; I don't see any god-damned underpants gnomes, Tweek. Sure.   Thanks, dude. Damnit! What the hell is wrong with you, Tweek?!  "And as the voluminous corporate automaton bulldozes its way through bantam America... And that's our report, I guess. I think it went really good. Those people really got into it. Hey. Do you ever think maybe you shouldn't give your son coffee? Like look at him. He's always shaking and nervous. My butt hurts. Uh... ''[screen right to screen left] I don't like big corporations.'' Oh, God, when is this gonna end? So what are we gonna say? Does anybody know anything about corporations?  Well, how about we just say, "corporates should be stopped"?<br>  Sshh, don't scare him. Cartman! Why do you always have to hit stuff with a stick?! Yeah, look what you're doing to this poor kid. Show us. Yeah. It's almost as big as Cartman's ass. Sooo, what's phase 2? Do you guys know anything about corporations? You bastards. Listen, we have to give a huge speech tomorrow about corporate takeovers. What? Big corporations are good! Because without big corporations we wouldn't have things like cars and computers and canned soup. Uuuh. Well, the truth is, we didn't write that paper last time. Go, dude, go!   Dude! Let's go look for crocodiles! ''That's'' not how a croc sounds, you fatass penis! Get away from me, Cartman!   AAAAAAAAAA!  You guuuys! I think so. Is Cartman up there? Cartman, you fucking hunk of fat, rat-fucking hunk of pig-fucking ass fat. I don't think so. Sick, dude!  Come on, dude. I wanna get out of here. Dude, it's a dude! Wow. Cool. Yeah, sweet! Maybe ''we'' can get a reward for the ''frozen'' guy! I don't know. We just have to get it to town and let ''them'' figure out what to do with it. No, dude! We have to name it Steve. It's ''my'' name, and ''I'' found him. What are you talking about, dude?! I fell down that abyss and there it was! Kenny, who found the ice man? But we found a frozen ice man from the past!  No. ''I'' found this frozen guy in the woods today. We came for our reward. Sweet. How about Steve?  Gorak's a gay name. Why are you being such a dick? Nuh-uh! I'll go. You bastards! Good job, dude! You freaked him out! Guess what? ''You're'' not my best ''friend'' anymore! Cartman's my ''new'' best friend! Fine!  No, he sure doesn't. Well, I was talking to Cartman, too! He's ''my'' creature! But it isn't right! What?! I'm not talking to you!   I'm here to bust out Steve. His name is Steve! Steve! Steve! Be''cause'', he kinda like looks like Steve Austin, the $6 million man. Does so! You're a dick! You want a fight? Well, that's fine with me! Well, why don't we make ''3'' o'clock?   Steve, wait! I've got something to show Steve, ''dick!'' Steve, you don't have to freeze yourself. Look! It's this place called Des Moines. It's like, lost in time, see?  Fashion is two years behind, Technology is two years behind, fads, are two years behind, just like you. Come on, Steve, you're going to Des Moines! No you ''don't'', butthole! We have to get our friend, Steve- -to Des Moines, or else he's gonna melt away. Frosty, Steve, whatever. ''Oh.'' We'll wait for you over there, Steve. We have to start fighting now. Okay. First one to die, loses. Okay.  So, here we go.  Go.   Oh.  Oh. Okay, it's over this way. Later. Uh huh. Cool. His name... is Steve! Steve! Steve, look out! Steve, look out! I can't believe he's gone. Hey! No- Dude, Gorak is cool because it's original. And besides, you found him. Me too. He sucks. Oh, that poor kid. It must be hell for him going through all this. We can't even leave our homes for fear of our children's safety. Just a little higher. Oh, hi, ''bubele''. I'm glad you're here; you can help decorate for the party. To celebrate your little brother's  passage into life. It's Jewish tradition, ''bubbe''. Oy, what is the matter with them? ''Bubbe'', where have you been? Dinner's been ready for five minutes. How ''is'' my little jellybean? Okay, but first let Mommy give you a kiss. Aaaaargh! Omigod, make him stop! ''My baby!'' Oh, God, the horror!  Ooooohhhhhhooh-ho! Oooh, my baby! Bubbeleh mine! Waagghh!! My baby!!  Oh, he's dead, he's ''dead!'' My little <i>bubbeleh's</i> dead! Well, ''bubbe'', there's something you have to know. Ike wasn't really your brother, he was adopted. What are you talking about? What-what-whaaat?! Now, where did you leave him, young man? Gerald! Do something about your smart-ass son! If we don't find him, so help me, you're gonna be grounded for a month! Ike, love? Excuse me, we're looking for a two-year-old Canadian boy.  Come on! Ike! But first, apologize to your brother! Hello, Tom. Hello, Patty. Thanks for coming to Ike's bris. Look Ike, It's Uncle Murray! He's been sent to his room for being a bastard. He's decided that Ike isn't his brother, since he's adopted. Hello. Do I know you? Ohhh, thanks. Hello, Dr. Schwartz! Thank you so much for coming all this way to perform Ike's bris. Right over here.  Kyle, what are you talking about? Kyle! That is enough! I've been reading up on your poor nurse's condition, and it is ''nothing'' to be made fun of. It's called "conjoined twin myslexia". Now, that's just the kind of unawareness that we need to fight against. Sit down, boys. You see boys, sometimes, when babies are born, they're born as twins. But sometimes the twins get hooked together, and they're born as ''Siamese'' twins. But sometimes, after the Siamese twins are joined together, one of the twins dies before birth. The living baby is born with the dead baby still attached. Sometimes, this dead twin is inside the living person, so even ''you'' could have a dead twin inside you and not even know it! So now that you're educated about her disease, you won't need to make fun of her. Right, bubbe? Can you imagine that poor, poor woman? Feeling like an outcast, being ridiculed every day... Hello? Oh, yes. Hello, Sharon. Well, Sharon, I was just trying to educate them about conjoined twin myslexia.  That does it! I must educate the entire town about this awful disease! Nothing is pissing me off! I just wanta start a movement. I want to talk to you all about your school nurse. No, no no. I'm not upset about her. I want to make the public aware of her. Her disease should be brought to light so that it can be understood rather than made fun of. She has a dead fetus attached to her head. Well, that's exactly what I'm talking about. This poor woman is forced to live in the shadows because she feels like an outcast. It is up to ''us'' to make her feel comfortable and welcome in our town! I want to invite your nurse to a dinner party at my house this evening. I'd appreciate it if both you and Mr. Mackey would attend. Wonderful! So, uhh, where did you get your degree, Nurse Gollum? Ahhh. Gerald! Keep your damn mouth shut!  Please forgive us. I-I'm terribly sorry, Nurse Gollum. I have felt so bad ever since I heard the boys making fun of you-- Yes, we could get you a few hats and wear a different one every day. No big whoop. I've got it! We could set aside a whole week to make the public aware of folks just like you. ''Ooooh'', this is so exciting! I'm gonna get the mayor on the phone right now! Dammit, Kyle! We've been working all week against that kind of behavior!  She's really touched. Yeah, the nerve of some people.  Oy, I knew I shouldn't have made Kyle eat that gefukahukah. It's only a matter of time before they're selling their bodies and buying smack.  Bubbeleh you need to get to bed! It's late! Well, hurry up! My God, I never knew chickenpox was such a dangerous illness. That's not crazy at all, Sharon. Mothers do it all the time. Noo, no. And I'm pretty sure that strange little boy Kenny has the chickenpox right now. How would you boys like to have a little slumber party at your friend Kenny's house tonight? I don't understand it. He's perfectly healthy. Are you sure you stayed over at Kenny's house? Did you sleep in the same room? Bubbe, how would you like to spend the night at your friend Kenny's house again? Well I think you need to spend more time with your friends. I'm gonna give Mrs. McCormick a call. ''No'', bubbeleh. You play with Kenny some more. I've got a ''great'' game for you. It's called "ookie mouth". First, you let Kenny spit in your mouth. Then you try to swallow his spit and say "ookie mouth" at the same time. No, no, bubbe, it's loads of fun. Try it. That ought to take care of it. Oh, no thank you. It's ''terrific'' though, it's-- You don't have any tea bags or coffee grounds to go in the hot water, do you? I see. Well, you certainly have aab- humble home, Mrs. McCormick. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Try again, bubbe! You know, your husband and mine used to work together as teenagers. ''Real''ly? I met Gerald in college, so I didn't know. What happened to them? Well that's too bad. I'm sure your husband's a fine man. But if they were such good friends it seems silly that they don't even talk anymore. Let's get them together! We'll just arrange a little fishing trip for them or something. Practice makes perfect, bubbe. No I don't understand it, Dr. Schwartz, he's ''perfectly'' healthy. He's been over at Kenny's house three days in a row and still hasn't caught the chickenpox. I don't know what else to do. We sent the ''other'' boys over and ''they'' all got sick, but I can't get my little Kyle to catch it.  Kyle, what are ''you'' doing there, honey?  I'll call you back, Dr. Schwartz.  What, ''bubbeleh'', what is it? ''Oy''. It was for your own good, Kyle. I wanted you to get chickenpox while you were young. Now, Kyle, come here. Hoh boy. So how was it? Did you boys have a good time fishing? Catch anything? Well, darling, I have to tell you something. He didn't invite you. I set the whole thing up. ''I'' thought it would be ''good'' for you.  I'm doing the best I can!  Oh good, maybe you finally caught the chicken-- Kyle!! And how are you, Kyle? What-what-whaaat?! You did this?! It's true. We were wrong for deceiving you about it. Kyle, what are you doing here?! This is very dangerous! Kyle, get back into the carnival this instant! You can't be out on the streets! Okay, here! Oy..! Thank you, Chef. Oh, of course! Here you go. Leaving so soon? Well, best of luck to you, then. Pretty much what I expected. It's so nice of you to take all the boys with you.  Goodbye, ''bubbe''! Be careful! Uh... Where ''are'' our children? Hello, Sheila? It's Sharon, Stan's mother. Sheila, I was just wondering if you might know why my son is trying to split his head open with an ice pick? So this ''is'' your fault. Would you do me a favor? Next time you want to scare the hell out of my child, just go outside and sit in the road until a truck runs you over instead? Oh, hello, Ms. Cartman. It's Sharon, Stan's mother. Ms. Cartman, is your son at home? Well, now I ''am'' worried. I've tried all the houses and nobody knows where they are. What do ya mean?! How often does an entire third-grade class go missing?! Run away? Let's get started right away! They could be halfway to L. A. by now. But what's wrong with her? No, no, she's been perfectly healthy.  Shelly, look who's come to visit you; your little brother, Stan.  Will my daughter be okay? Come on, Stanley. Give your sister a kiss and then we have to go. ...and then the doctor said that it's much worse as you get older. My daughter is in pretty bad shape ''now'', but if she were in her twenties, she could ''die''. So tell me if I'm crazy, but I started thinking that we should ''intentionally'' have our boys play with a child who has the chickenpox. Let them get it now, while they're young. So it's not such a crazy idea after all? Boys, you're going to sleep over at Kenny's, and that's final. Okay, lemme see. Oh, goody! You've got a fever! Yyup, it looks like you've got chickenpox alright. Oh, gee, I guess you did. All right, it's off to bed with you, young man.  Stanley, can I get you anything else? Stanley? Oh my God! Randy?! Randy, hurry, he's burning up! Don't you worry, Stanley, you're going to be okay. Kids, Daddy and I are gonna be right back, okay?  Oh God, what have we done? Well, your teacher sent this stuff over for you to do while you're sick. Now, Stanley, I know at your age teachers can seem cold and heartless, but later, you'll understand that he did this for your own good. Oh. Well, anyway, here's a pencil and some paper. Yeah, and then we're going to the movies. You mean Stanley's missing?  Oh my God! Our son ran away! ''Die?'' Oh God, no! Stanley?  Oh, Stanley, where are you..? Stanley! Damn it, Stanley, you had us worried sick! You ''have'' to get back to the hospital for a shot! Stanley, how are you feeling today, son?  The doctor says that maybe you can go home tomorrow. What's so funny, you two?  Kids, we should have honest about wanting you to get chickenpox.  Randy, my wedding ring! I lost it down the garbage disposal! Stanley, I thought I told you not to watch this horrible cartoon! Here, Stanley, You watch nice cartoons like ''Fat Abbot''. Randy, will you please come get my wedding ring out of the sink? Did you find it? Don't snap at me! You snapped at me! What ever?! In fifteen years you've never said, "whatever," to me! I'm sorry, too. That's not it, you idiot!  You just said the C-word! What are you doing, sweetheart? You men are all alike. First you get a cookie and then you criticize the way I dress and then it's the way I cook! I suppose next you'll be telling me that you need your space and that I'm sabotaging your creativity. Go ahead, Stanley, get your God-damned cookie! Randy, let me handle this. Now Stanley, I want you to explain to me why you were passing notes in school. You really should know better, Stanley.  Don't interrupt me! You always interrupt me when I talk! Can't you see that I--? There, you did it again!  He interrupted me again.  Like you're one to talk! When's the last time you really listened to what I had to say?! Like I'm a ghost. Like he sees right through me. Oh, please yourself! He is. Oh, I'm sorry! I guess I'm wrong again! Stanley, I think you should know that your father has moved out. Because, we're divorced, Stanley. Yeah, kind of. But I would like you to meet your new stepfather, Roy. I'll leave you two alone to get acquainted. Stanley, it's time to go! Your bastard father has visitation rights, and this is his time with you. Come on, Stanley!  Stanley, what did you do to Roy?  Stanley, you know you're the most important thing to me, right? Now Stanley, you have to understand how divorce works. When I say, "you're the most important thing to me," what I mean is, you're the most important thing after me and my happiness and my new romances. Bye now. Roy! Stanley?! Your father is coming over for visitation! Stan? Oh, Randy. What are you doing here? Oh I thought that note was for me. Well, it looks like our little Stanley has built himself quite a clubhouse here. Goodnight. Yes? It's too late for games. Truth. Oh, Randy, I do love you, but- now I'm so confused-uh. I'm living with Roy and-, I don't know how to break it off with him. Maybe. I guess it's my turn. Truth or Dare? Do me. Right here in the clubhouse. Stanley? Look who's here. Aunt Flo. Now, Stanley! Aunt Flo only visits once a month. Be nice. What do you say, Shelly? Okay, Stanley. Your turn. What do you say, Stanley? How do you like your fish, Stanley? Oh, now, what's spooky about a cute, little goldfish? Go put him in your room. Yes, you do! Language! Stanley, settle down! Uh, no problem, Aunt Flo. There, there, Aunt Flo. Stanley ''loves'' his goldfish.   Stanley, what are you doing?! Stanley, I'm in no mood for this! Not when your Aunt Flo is in town! Oh, look, you woke your sister up.  All right, Stanley. I have had enough o-   D'uh! Aunt Flo, what are ''you'' doing up?! Sshh. It's going to be okay, Stanley.  Now get some sleep, baby. Mommy's taken care of everything.  My baby's killed again!  I've got such a handsome boy, such a good boy.  Oh. Uh-Officer Barbrady, Woo, wh-what a surprise. What can I do for you? Is that so? I'd never seen ''any'' of those men, Officer Barbrady.  Why would you wanna do that? Nobody's going to take my baby away from me! Nobody!    Stanley. Kenny's mother is here. She's wondering if you've seen Kenny. Yeah. Stan just got a new goldfish and he wanted to show it to Kenny but, Kenny never came over.  Mrs. McCormick, I'm going to have to ask you to leave! You've been drinking! I believe you, sweetheart.  Run from him, boys. Run and don't stop! Yes, hon?   Oh, Randy, I just don't know what to do anymore. I just ughhhh, I can't believe that Aunt Flo is gone, that she won't be visiting me ever again.  Oh, dear. It really ''was'' Stan's fish that killed those people! The answer is "no", Stanley! I'm sorry, Stanley, I can't let you go all the way to Nebraska by yourself. It's the holidays. I'll leave it up to your father.  The answer is no, Stanley! Now go wash up for supper!  I just can't believe he would go without our permission! Well, I hope for ''his'' sake you're right.  Hello, Ms. Cartman. It's Sharon, Stan's mother. Did Stanley go up there to Nebraska with you? ''Wwhat?!''  Get the car, Randy! We're going to Nebraska! What's going on here?! Is this the Cartman residence? Give me that!  Stanley! This is your mother!  ''What do you have to say for yourself, Stanley?!'' Oh, Stanley. Let's just forget the whole thing and have a nice holiday back home. Officer Barbrady, let's pretend for one second that we had a competent law enforcer in this town: what would ''he'' do?  The press is here.  Youuu certainly made it up here quickly.  Really?? Mr. Director person, what exactly do you want to do? Shh. Are you sure this wouldn't make our little town look dangerous?  Weelll, in that case, I guess it's okay! My God, this is the worst storm I've ever seen. Buut, how do we decide ''"who"''? We're all going to die in this horrible place.   Yes, of course. Nobody gives a shit about Eric Roberts. Well, there's no going back now.  God save us. My God, what a harrowing tale of human drama this is. All of us doing what we must to survive. But- hhhow will we live with ourselves now? I don't believe it. All this time, Barbrady actually did keep this town peaceful. He is. No reason for concern. I want to assure all of you that Officer Barbrady is still our active police force. Uhhhhh, plan? I don't actually uh-- Yes, that's right. It's back to school with Officer Barbrady! Officer Barbrady, what are you doing?! Well, how's the reading coming along? Barbrady, we really need you to speed this up. The Chickenfucker struck again last night. The perpetrator left ''this clue'' at the crime scene.  You have to learn to read faster, Barbrady! Listen, buddy! Either you learn to read quick, or else I'm gonna find a law officer to replace you forever! Ladies and gentlemen, this is indeed a great week for South Park. Ms. Hermans has opened the east wing of the library, and our own South Park Cows Elementary School Dodgeball Team is going to the national finals... ...where they will undoubtedly be beaten senseless by the Washington team. But most importantly, this week has brought to my attention a very serious and dreaded disease: conjoined twin myslexia. And so it is in honor of this that I declare this exciting week as Conjoined Twin Myslexia Week! And now, let's kick off our week long festivities with the first annual Grand Conjoined Parade! Let's hear it for these brave souls! What a glorious parade that was! Let's hear it for the parade coordinators!  Nonsense. This is your week. You aren't going anywhere. And so, at this honorary dinner we take a look back at our beloved Nurse Gollum and the brave life she has lived. Roll the tape, please, Mr. Garrison.  Nurse Gollum!! Ladies and gentlemen, on this fourth day of Conjoined Twin Myslexia Week, all our prayers are with our little South Park Cows now playing their hearts out in China. Now, join me in saluting our Cows and help make Nurse Gollum ''not'' feel like an outcast with our first official Conjoined Twin Myslexia hats! As this year's Conjoined Twin Myslexia Awareness Week draws to a close, I would like to personally thank all of you for your enthusiastic cooperation. Now, let's hear it one more time for our world champion South Park Cows! And now, let's hear from the woman of the week! The incredible, courageous Nurse Gollum! Uhhh, freaks with big hearts! And now-- This is absurd! We need fireworks for our Fourth of July celebration at the lake.  Well, keep looking.  This is ridiculous. We can't have a celebration without fireworks. Whoever heard of a Fourth of July picnic with snakes? Wait a minute. That's it! I got it! This Fourth of July, South Park will make history by having the largest snake in the world! The press will love it. I'll be on the front pa--  Oooooogh... Just cut to the chase and tell us about the snake! Ooooh!  Comanche helicopters... ...flamethrowers, triggered at the same time... Well, you see? Fireworks at the lake will not only go on, but perhaps be the best ever. Wait a minute! We're gonna need an orchestra to play ''The Stars and Stripes''! Yes! Get the school principal on the phone! And we need somebody to dress up like Uncle Remus! Of course I do, you fuckin' asshole! Where the hell is our firework? We only have 24 hours! Shut up! Oh, we're doomed. Our Fourth of July celebration is going to have no fireworks and a bunch of tone-deaf little shits playing. Wait a minute... It's the snake! Call everybody! The show's back on! Come on, we've only got one day to prepare! Ladies and gentlemen, good citizens of Colorado. It's my pleasure to be the first person to wish you all a happy Fourth of July! Let's start with our school band playing ''The Stars and Stripes''! What is fuck is that?! Oh, hell. Light the snake! My God, it's beautiful. It never fails to amaze me how I manage to overcome adversity. Say uh, Charlie, when does that thing die out? Yes, you know, expire, end. Hello? I'm asking you when it stops? What?!  You tell me, how much longer this thing is gonna last?! So when does it run out?! Oh, hell..! Yes! Apparently, my plan to-o blow up the snake worked perfectly.  Wow, look at this, Johnson. Traffic jams at every intersection, hoards of people pushing their way through the crowd. It's almost like we're a real city. They're Hollywood! They can do anything! Excuse me, Mr. Film Commissioner, could I have a word with you? Well, the people of my town are a little upset. I don't think we realized what an impact this festival would have on our town. Right. So, we were actually wondering if we could call this whole thing off? Ooh, yeaah. Now all we have is a town covered in shit! This is ''much'' better! Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to kick off the 14th Annual South Park Cow Days! As most of you know, Cow Days is when we all get together to celebrate and thank the noble, gentle cow. And now, the chairman of Cow Days, Jimbo Kern! Now get out to the carnival and enjoy the amazing rides and the wonderful games! You found it! You found the memorial! And the cows? Are they all back, too? What?! Well, perhaps, one day, cows will learn that cults are never a good thing. Sounds like somebody declared Shenanigans! Didn't we ever release them? Oh my God! Officer Barbrady, ugh, you never had Tom and Mary in this cell. No, no. In fact, they never came to South Park. We've never heard of them. Ohh, that was wonderful, Chef. Good show. Oh, come on, buck up, little fella. Aw, hell! And the winner is: Squash-O-Lantern, by Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, and the evil Eric Cartman from the parallel universe! "The Winning Entry! Squash in cobweb, amid a tiny graveyard and flanked by four tiny bats" You boys win the Halloween Chocolate Ball! Oh, what now?! Aalll right, people. The next order of business is a very serious matter. We need to vote on whether South Park should reinstate the death penalty or not. All those in favor, say "yippee." All those opposed, say "nay." Not now, kids. The town is having a very important debate on capital punishment.  What the hell is going on here?  Reward? What reward? Holy crap! He's alive??  Well, quick, do something! Well, you just can't let him die. Mayor! Mayor! Looks like winter's right around the corner. Better get some firewood ready. Howdy, Chef. How was your summer vacation? Look, look! Here comes somebody! AAWWWW!  Hey! Aaww!  Is there a problem, young man? I'd like to pay for one. Oh, my God, it's crap! Let's get out of this town! Yeah, who the heck finds this stuff interesting? Oh, it's little Eric! Ey! Screw you!  My name is Sid Greenfield. I'm the director from Los Angeles for ''America's Most Wanted''. We're desperate for stories. A-and this one is so compelling. Sure. This story has everything. People. Furniture. Talking-ih it's a real American story. We just want to do a recreation of the story for our show. Then we'll flash a number on the screen that people can call if they have any information regarding the identity or location of the shooter. That's it. You win, we win, America wins. Don't worry, Mayor. ''America's Most Wanted'' is not about violence, it's about family. Great! We'll get started with auditions immediately. What part should we cast first? Oh, thank you very much. We'll get back to you.  I think I've seen enough genetic engineers. Let's move on to the auditions for the part of Mister-uhh Garrison. Alright, not bad. Let's keep him on the top pile. Next! Thank you! Next!  Next! Perfect! You got it! Let's move on to the Chefs! God, I hate mountains. This better not push back our shooting schedule. Okay, people, let's rehearse the reenactment from the top before we shoot it. Who's that? Whoa. Talk about "all washed-up", huh? Great to have you, Eric! Here we go, aaand action. Bang!! What the--? Bu-eh. Eric Roberts is improvising lines again! God-dammit! What the hell is this?! Somebody go see why we lost the hookup! We're snowed in? Uuuhh, it's only been like, four hours. Aren't you resorting to cannibalism a little quickly? Now, wait a minute. We all had a big breakfast: can't you people go without eating for a little while? Well- who the hell made ''you'' the boss anyway? How ''can'' we? How could we ''live'' with ourselves?  Aaww. What? Christ, are you people diabetic or something? It is? We've lost the feed to L.A. Uhh, we're gonna go grab some lunch and maybe get some shots of those turtles down at the pond. A-and we're cut. Great show, guys.  Great news, guys. Your TV show ratings have doubled! They've gone from six people to twelve. Alright, we're ten second to air, guys. And five, four, three... With the log ride? A-and we're out. I want to have... an abortion. Cartman. Yesuh- it's such a hard decision, but I just don't feel I can raise a child in this screwy world. About eight years ago. Eight years old. Really? But I just don't think I'm a fit mother. Well, I think you need to keep ''your laws'' off of ''my body''.  Well, that's exactly what I intend to do. Good day! ...And so you see, Congressman O'Reilly, that's why I think abortion laws should be changed. But the person at Unplanned Parenthood said you were who I had to talk to about changing the law. Oh, dear. Don't you see, Governor? I should have a right to have an abortion if I want one. I mean, what right do I have bringing another child into this overpopulated world? Then again, I should've thought of that before having sex. then againuh-- Oh, I just don't know...  Oh, thank you, ''thank'' you.  Terminated? Oh no uh- I didn't mean that. I meant the ''other'' thing you can do-what's that other A word? Yess, that's what I mean. Adoption. Oh, I should tell my son the truth about everything myself. Good day, Mr. President.  Yes, it's true. It's true. I'm sorry I never told you, Eric. I just thought, maybe it would be a little shocking to you. Hello? Oh yes, Sharon. How are you? Hu-old on, dear, let me check. Hon, I made beefy logs. I made Cookie Dings. No, he's not here. Oh, dear! Ah-are you okay, hon? Oh. Well. Would you like some beetles for breakfast? Mmmm. Mmmm. Beetles are good with ice cream. I guess it's much better to get it when you're young. Oh, yes. When I was a child, my mother had me go over to a little girl's house who had the chickenpox, just so I would get it. Don't scratch it, hon. ''No'', hon. Here, I got you some calamine lotion. It'll make your itches go away. Not too much, hon. It says on the bottle that too much can be bad.  I'm back, hon. I got some more calamine lotion. Just use a little bit of that stuff, hon. It has to last a while. Ooh, I have them somewhere else, poopiekins. What's that, Eric? Don't pick your nose, hon. Don't be nervous. I'm sure you'll win. Hello, everybody.  Now, just do it like we rehearsed, hon. Thank you. Don't pick your nose, hon. Oohh, you look great, hon. Mommy's fat little piggy. Oh wait, wait. You've got a little eye booger, hon. Got it.  Don't pick your nose, hon.  How's the treehouse coming along, hon? Sorry, hon. Well, I don't know, Eric. If you did that, then the floors would be bare. Well, all right. Eric, snookums! it's time for Mommy to tuck you into your snuggleboat for night-night. Eric, are you out there in your clubhouse? Oh, it's my pleasure. Eric loves his little friends. Around six hours. Well, I've got an idea. We could sing. ''Over the meadow and through the woods'' Ooo, careful hon. These roads are bumpy. Here we go, kids. We're crossing the state line into Nebraska.  Wheat. The building block of your favorite foods, and, Nebraska's principal source of economic productivity. You see, when Nebraska first became-- That shouldn't be a problem. Eric's Grandma is right near the mall. About another hour, hon. Now, Eric, let's try to get out of that grumpy mood before we get to Grandma's.''<br />   Hello everyone. Happy Holidays! These are Eric's friends: Stan, Kyle, and Kenny. Boys, let me introduce you to the Cartman family. This is Uncle Stinky. Aunt Lisa, Cousin Fred, Cousin Alexandra  No, no, Florence, that's not Eric.  Ooh, I'm sorry to hear that, Stanley. Here, Kyle. Will you hold Great-Grandma's catheter bag during dinner?   Great-grandma has a bladder problem. This helps her out.  Eric, did you say 'hi' to your little cousin Elvin? Hi, Howard. Hello? Oh, why yes he did. I thought you were dead, Sharon. Stanley told me you had passed on. I'm glad to see that you're better. Uoh well, we can do that. This must be a very difficult time for you, Mrs... Yes, Ms. Cartman. If you don't feel fit to raise a child, then abortion probably is the answer. Do you know the actual time of conception?  ...I sseee, so the fetus is... Ms. Cartman, uh- eight years old is a little late to be considering abortion. Yes, this is what we would refer to as the "fortieth trimester". Wuh... But we prefer to abort babies a little- ...earlier on; in fact, there's a law against abortions after the ''second'' trimester. Hmmmmm. Tsk, I'm afraid I can't help you, Ms. Cartman. If you want to change the law, you'll have to speak with your congressman. One moment, ''please''. Nurse, I need 20 cc's of sodium pentathol, stat! We're an equal-opportunity employer here, son. I'll be right with you, right after I inject this man with a long needle. There there, young man. Medical science is nothing to be afraid of. Yes. I can hear the needle scraping against the bone inside. Oops, he's hemorrhaging.  Ooo! His head fell off. Ugh, some people just have a weak stomach. Well, this is about all I can do for him. Sorry, son, it might be a while. Now, son, that's not's gonna do him any good. I'll let you know if there's a change in his condition. My God, that's a hell of a storm. We're doing the best we can, ma'am. They've closed the pass and none of the other doctors can get through. For now, it's just me, and Nurse Goodly. Yes, I'm afraid we're critically understaffed. Unless we get help soon, all these people in here are completely fucked. Metaphorically speaking, that is. He's on full life-support and breathing fine. He shouldn't need any help - so long as the power doesn't go out. Oof. Who didn't see ''that'' coming a mile away, huh?  Nurse, I could use some help in here! Nurse, please! I need another pair of hands in here! Oh, sorry. Please, Mr. Chef. I've over 100 people to attend to an-and only myself and Nurse Goodly. Do you know anything about surgery? What?! Why the hell didn't you say so? Put on some scrubs! Boys, I'm making you all honorary doctors. You can help us save these people's lives. Miles' appendix has burst. I have no choice but to operate now with our limited power. I need you all to be strong for me.  Boys, you have to help with suction and bandages. Ready? Okay. First, I'll make an incision on the chest, over the heart. Suction! I found a map that shows the location of a backup generator. Apparently, they built a large self-sustaining generator- for just this kind of emergency. But it's out and away from the hospital. We must split up into two teams: Team A, and Team B. Team A will consist of myself, Stan, Kyle, Eric, Chef, and Nurse Goodly. Team B will consist of Kenny. Now, listen closely, Team B. Your goal will be to turn on the backup generator. To do this you must brave the storm outside and get into this sewage duct. Meanwhile, Team A will go to the holding area, here  where there is a television, and some cocoa. We will drink the cocoa and watch family programming until Team B makes it through the sewage duct. By that time, Team B- remember, that's you, Kenny- should reach the outer core of the generator. It will be a cold and dangerous climb to the top, and there could be velociraptors- here. Once you reach the top, you should be able to get a clear view from this windows of us drinking cocoa and watching television. Then, you could proceed down into the generator, and power it on. Are there any questions? Great, then, let's do it. Go, Team! Team B? Come in, Team B. Listen, Team B. We've found another path to the generator. There's actually a nice heated walkway to it, so you don't need to walk through all that sewage. Oh... Well, forget I said that, then. Listen, Team B, you should be seeing a large drift of snow with some metal sticking out of it just to your left. Good. Head towards it. Team A out. Roger, Team B.  Team B, can you see the two copper nodes? Good. Now, is there a wire connecting them? Damn! The wire connecting the nodes is gone! We need to complete the circuit between them, or we're screwed. There's no time! Once these lights flicker out all the patients on life-support are going to die! No, Kenny, you can't. There must be some other way! He's going to make the connection himself, with his hands. Kenny! Nnnoooooo! Quickly! Get the scanner running again! We've got a chance now! Well, we made it. The power is on, the snow is melting, and your friend Mephesto is doing fine. Where's the little fat boy? He'll be delighted that Mephesto's awake. It's a good thing we got her to the hospital in time. It's chickenpox. There seems to be a small epidemic going around. Your daughter never had the chickenpox as a little child, I take it? Well, that's the problem. You see, chickenpox is a pretty normal thing for young children, but as you get older it becomes a more and more ferocious disease. You know, most people don't realize that chickenpox is actually a form of herpes. She'll be fine. We just want to be cautious and monitor her here.  Can I talk to you outside? He'll be okay, but it's a good idea for us to monitor him for a while. There there now, it's not your fault. Oh, wow, you did? Wow. You guys suck. Yes? Stan? Oh, yes. ''Where'' is Stan? ''No'', no. He's not missing. We just... can't seem to find him at this moment. ''Oh'' sure, sure. But we have to get him back soon. If he doesn't get his antibiotic shot today, he could die. Yes, die. It won't be any easy death, either. The chickenpox will slowly move down his trachea into his lungs. As he chokes for breath, the pox will move through his inner ear into his brain, making him think he's David Duchovny. Now moving on all fours and wheezing uncontrollably, his cellular structure will regress into a gelatinous mass of-- Well, I hope you boys learned your lesson. Going out and playing around with chickenpox almost killed you all. Well just be thankful we got you here in time. Your parents are here to see you, I'll send them in. Boys, I'm afraid your fat little friend has suffered head trauma. Well, apparently, he thinks he's a Vietnamese prostitute named Ming Li. What? No, boys! You need to take him home and let him get plenty of sleep. Give the child to me. Uhhh...  It's a stick. It's over, Mr. Garrison. This is it. We had enough. Ooooo, I think you're hitting the bone. And the father of Eric Cartman is... Bang! Oh, Jiminy! I've been shot!  Call the Mr. Garrison auditions! Oh, that's TV's Eric Roberts. We were able to get him to play the part of the little monkey guy. Oh I have to get out of here, I haven't eaten since breakfast.  Well I have to admit, Eric Roberts was much juicier than I expected. From this day on, all will be well. Boy, I sure hope I'm not Eric Cartman's father, Mr. Hat.  You can say that again, Mr. Garrison! You can say that again, Mr. Garrison! I sure did, Mr. Garrison. What a retard! Yes, conjugate the verb. That's right, Mr. Garrison. The Vietnam War was sticky and icky.  I sure hope that I'm not Eric Cartman's father, Mr. Hat.  You can say that again, Mr. Garrison. Well, all I know is that third-trimester abortions are illegal. I don't really know anything about 40th. No- No, I think youah gotta talk to the governor about that stuff. I want to announce who the father is. Oh, I've been shot!   Whoaw..!  I've been shot! Nobody move! I'm a law officer! You seem somewhat unnerved by this, Chef. Our differences must be set aside for now, Mr. Chef. I'm simply a man, a man trying to do my job. My God, I think he's gone into cardiac arrest! Are you accusing me, Barbrady? Because if you are accusing me, don't hide behind your clever riddles! I'm going to get the man to a hospital. Who will help me? Doctor, I can't focus! He-e-ey, man, I overheard what you said; that was coool! Would you like to come over to my place and finger-paint? Let's get married and have a honeymoon in India. Wooow, this is sooo beautiful! And I am one with you.   Whoa... Tonight, on ''America's Most Wanted'', a shooter is on the loose in Colorado, and its residents are up in arms! Here's your host, John Walsh. Terrance and Phillip will be right back after these announcements. And now back to Terrance and Phillip. And now, back to "The Grinchy Poo"  ''What is the future of America? Is it the money we make?''  ''So what do children have to say about Prop. 10?'' ''It's time to stop large corporations. Prop. 10 is about children. Vote Yes on Prop. 10, or else, you ''hate'' children. You don't hate... children... do you? Remember, keep American business small, or else.''  ''Paid for by Citizens for a Fair and Equal way to get Harbucks Coffee kicked out of town forever.'' Good evening and welcome to ''America's Most Wanted''. Tonight: terror invaded the small mountain community of South Park, Colorado, when Dr. Alphonse Mephesto  in hopes that ''your calls'' could help solve the case. Uuuhm... We-we seem to have lost our linkup to the South Park crew, sso I guess we'll be going to our featured movie, ''Who Framed Roger Rabbit''.  My God, Mr. Hat! Get some help! Right away, Mr. Garrison. No, no! My lifetime partner and friend, gone, taken away in the wink of an eye. O, Fortune, why do you mock me? This is not a world I want to live in! Doesn't anyone want-- No! No, please! Don't panic, anybody. The power lines are down, but the backup generator is running just fine. Coming! Yes, for now. But I'm afraid the generator won't run for long. The batteries run out in half an hour. Time is very short.  Mmaarr. I don't know-uh, I might need some more convincing, hm-hm-hm. Yes. We're trapped! That's not how ''I'' played it! It's almost midnight. Oohhh, ohh, you've got it all wrong, my little friend. You do it like this:  You've gotta get 'em in the head; they go down quicker. Well anyway, I'm relieving you of your duties. I've proved that I can read, and now I'm back on the job! Now?  Well, I-ee uh... I think I'll get in the bathtub, and then curl up with a good book. Oh, that was so touching. I'm afraid it's the big house for you, fruitcake.  Hello, Mr. Tweek. Who was that? Well, okay, Mrs. Cartman, I'll legalize 40th trimester abortions for you. We'll have the pregnancy terminated immediately.  Why yes, that's what an abortion is. Adoption? Well, that's- pretty different. Mm-one day at a time, Mayor. Mm-one day at a time. M-hi, Ned. It's comin' right for us. Mmm-we're environmentalists. M-whoa, I'm scared. Mm-good night. Aggghhh! Mmmm-damn that frog. Mmm-Da Nang. Mm-Jimbo, look! Mm-roger that. Mmmm-where are we going? Mmmm-why are we going to México? Are fireworks legal in Mexico? Nnnn-no moleste el gato spectacularrrr. (Do not disturb the spectacular cat.) Mmmm-they're spectacularrrr. Hmmm-bueyno. Mmmmmmm-yup. Mmm-well better luck next year.  Mmmm-is anyone other than the two of you riding in this vehicle? Mmmm-do you have any firearms or explosives in the car? Mmm-it looks like my ex-wife! Ow. Mmmm-gahyah! Git along, little doggies! Bad cows stay! Stay! AAAAAH!   Hello, kids. I see you're discovering the magic of reading. I drive the Booktastic bus, where ''magic'' begins. You see, reading opens up whole new worlds to you. You can take a canoe down the Amazon or go back in time to Camelot or become a race car driver, all by just opening a book. Just like magic. The magic of reading. Go ahead and pick any books you like. Then give in. Give in to the magic.  Good day, friends. Welcome to the magical world of reading. Oohhh, that's a very magical book, full of wondrous-- Indeed, you did. How did you know I would strike here? You did?! Really?! Then it worked! My whole plan worked absolutely perfectly!  When I heard that Officer Barbrady couldn't read, I knew I had to motivate him somehow. So I formulated a plan to encourage him to learn the magic of reading! Yes! Yes, exactly! Don't you see? Only by fucking chickens could I get Officer Barbrady to become literate. Oh, no? He who was blind can now see! I got Officer Brabrady to read. My plan worked perfectly. You're welcome. And now, my reading friend, you've proven that you are ready for the big time. I give you this hardback copy of ''Atlas Shrugged'', by Ayn Rand. Ow, that hurts!  Heee--!  All units. All units. Report to 254 Avenue de los Mexicanos. Possible hostile situation. All units. All units. We have a 5-20 on the suspect. Report to the South Park petting zoo immediately! And, Barbrady, your wife called. She wants you to get some pizza on the way home. Barbrady, I just caught some guy in here having sex with one of my chickens. Naw, I didn't see anything. It just happened so fast.  What does it say? Dammit, Barbrady, what the hell's wrong with you? Every time somethin' happens in this town, you say "Nothin' to see here", and "Case closed." But we want justice. We have to find this sicko! For what? Orderly conduct? I'm not fishin'. Be careful with old Bob here. He ain't much for a-ridin' anymore, but he's all I got. Well, have fun, boys. My God, that's disgusting! Oh, would you look at that, honey? Somebody dropped off a perfectly good trash can.  This is why I come to these things, to get away from L.A. and become one with the more simple culture. Ooh, do you have any tofu or steamed celery? Uuuuh, never mind. We brought some food from the Natural Market in L.A. I'll take two. Can I help you? I ''seem'' to remember a husband, but I think he was lost and never found on Kenosha Pass. Welcome to Fran's. Can I help you? Sir, can I help you? Sure, there's just one problem. We're a bank. Yes. Officer Barbrady, what would drive a man to such a disgusting act? What? Do the police have any leads? "Sick"?! What kind of lame excuse is that? What's he saying? But has Chickenfucker left any clues at the crime? What do you plan to do about the South Park riots? But he's illiterate. What do you plan to do? Oh, this is ridiculous! Is that English? Okay, thank you all for coming. There's uhh, coffee and brownies out front. Whoopee, this is killer! With no cops around, we can do whatever we want! Who knew? I always thought he was a complete idiot. Uh, just dramatic effect, sorry.  Wonderful. Hey! How about the elementary school orchestra? They had a great version of ''Mary Had a Little Lamb'' at their last concert. Uh, ladies and gentlemen, the Mayor of South Park regrets that she cannot be here herself, but she is... sick. We do, however, have an official statement for all the concerned cities about the matter with the giant snake that we can't seem to put out. Thank you, that is all. Reading classes, plain and simple. By the mayor's order, Officer Barbrady is on temporary leave of absence to learn to read, effective immediately. This time he made love to Carla Weathers' prize chicken. She's catatonic. Hey, what'd you do ''that'' for? Spectacular. Uh, Mayor, I think you mean Uncle Sam? I'm sure it'll be here any second. Copy that. I think it's ''The Stars and Stripes''. Sh-she's having her period. "We're sorry. Our bad." Can they do that? So, what are nice chickens like you doing in a coop like this? Hooray! Uhh, yes, Officer? Well, according to that sign right there, it's 40 miles an hour. Wait a second. Aren't you Stan's little friend?  Yeah. You're the one who always plugs up the toilet at our house. Yeah, right. You'd better get back to school, little boy. Ow! Ow! Hey, what the hell are you doing? You can't do that! Ah-ow! Ah-ow! Ow! Ooww! Dammit, stop. Oh! Dammit! How do we get our runaway children back? Hello, Stanley. It's me, Poppa. Gosh, your mother and I miss ya. And I hope that... wherever you may be, you'll hear this message. Doctor, we-uuuh purposefully sent our son to stay with a friend who had chickenpox so that he would get it early. Yeah, it's-it's true, he is. We're going down to-uhh Happy Burger for some milkshakes. See ya, son.  Doctor? Wh-where's Stan? Stan, our son? Will he be okay out of the hospital? Okay, well well, let's go look-- I'm-I'm sure he couldn't have gone far. Stan? Stan? Stanley, where the hell have you been?  Come on, we're taking you back to the hospital. What? Yeah. Isn't that great, Stanley? I can't believe you gave us herpes. You little rascals! Uh oh! No, I was just uh flipping through the channels. Okay. Uh, you just get a hammer and some wood. What? Uh some girls wanna play Truth or Dare or something? How do you think I met your mother? Oh, brother. Yeah, Stanley, you should know better.  Okay, okay. Give me a second, would you? I didn't snap at you. Whatever. I-I don't wanna fight, I'm sorry. Uh I think I found it. Hey, back off, bitch! Did I? Stanley, I... Skylarkings? Stanley, I want you to explain to me why you were passing notes in school. You need to shape up, mister.  I don't interrupt you. Okay, I'm sorry I interrupt. But she always takes over any conversation! When was the last time you had anything interesting to say? It's always gossip and stupid crap! Well- uh, I feel like everything I do is wrong, it doesn't matter what I say. Oh, please! No, she is. Hey, Stanley, uh, hop in. Listen, Stanley, I- I know all this change must be tough on you, but you know, your-your mother and I thought it'd be best for all of us if we'd split up. Well, hello, ladies.  I'm already there. What were we talking about? Oh yeah. See, your mother and I still care about you and your sister. But we just don't like being around each other any more. Well, no, because you're a family. You just can't leave family; you have to stick with family, no matter what. Hoho, Stan, you're so young. You just don't get it. Well, anyway, have a nice day. Yeah. But I loved our time together. I hate to see it end. Go on, get out. You know that nothing is more important to me than you, right, Stan? Oh boy, it's getting late. I'm gonna have to leave this party. I, uh, got a note from Stanley to come out to the-uh clubhouse. Oh, maybe it was. I remember not too long ago we were just kids playing kissing games in my clubhouse. Sharon? Truth or Dare? No, I'm serious, please. Truth or Dare? Do you still love me? Well, you never know. Maybe--  --thing will work out.  Dare. Good night, Stanley. We'll uh see you in the morning. Well, it has to be off, or your Aunt Flo will complain about wasting electricity. Yeah, me too. But she only visits your mom for five days or so. I'll be out sleeping on the couch. .  Sharon? There's a policeman being held captive in our basement.  Sh-sharon, why'd you take his- pants off? What is it? Oh. Uh, well, don't- think of it as an end, think of it as a new beginning. Now, could you fill me in on the dead bodies and captive policeman stuff real quick? I'm sorry my wife held you captive, officer. She's been upset 'cause her Aunt Flo isn't gonna visit her anymore. Uuuh, do you want your pants back?  Eh, it's fine with me. Now, Sharon, don't overreact. Maybe Stan didn't go to Cartman's Grandmother's. Maybe he just ran away or got kidnapped or something. Sure. We'll punish you after the holidays. Well, this is terrible! Now, who would have sex with a chicken? Have some respect for people's feelings, would you, Halfy?! "Yea, usher us unto the Lord", sayeth some Jewish guy once. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.  "Yea, let us ponder the Lord's mercy. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust." Yeah, and the food is terrible!  Oh... yeah.   Hooray, yeah! Whoo! Five George is ''en route'' to 496 Broad Wasteland...  Hi there, little lady. Well, hopefully spending some time with you, gorgeous. Is $20 enough?  What? Oh-oh-uh, is this a bust?  Hey, wait a minute. You're just a kid! Ow! Oo-''uhow''! Ow! Hey, man, what are you doing?! Ow, stop it! Huuh? I got a TV. Shh. Come on! All units, all units. Five-twelve at 635 Avenue de los Mexicanos; request assistance. We're fine, officer.  Just me and my wife and my brother. And my wife's cousin and his son and my brother's girlfriend and our two kids-- --and my brother's girlfriend's mother, and this guy Bob, who I met last year.  What—What did you say? Shut up, bitch! Look what she did to my fuckin' eye. Aagh! Yeah? What? Don't you know Kenny's sick with--? Oh yeah. We don't have a Nintendo. We got a ColecoVision hooked up to the black-and-white TV. Lord, we thank you for this ''staggering'' payload of frozen waffles you have bestowed upon us. And since we have been ''faith''ful to you, we ''know'' that you ''will'' send us some good fortune ''one'' of these days, even though you sure as hell seem to be taking your sweet time. Amen. So, Kyle, your dad's still bringing home those big, fat lawyer paychecks?  You know, your dad and I used to be best friends when we were teenagers. We would work together at Pizza Shack. But ''he'' got promoted and went off to community college and I didn't. And you know why? 'Cause your dad's ''Jewish''! Hey, is it ''my'' fault you don't know how to cook?! You just don't know how to use spices and stuff. Hey! We don't say "fuck" at the table, you little asshole! I didn't know you like to fish, Gerry. Tackle box? When you're uh-unemployed, weekends are meaningless. Beer? Hu hu hu hu heh yeah. It took us damn near two years to finish it.  That's where I live now. Not that easy. You were lucky. You had rich parents. You got to go to that expensive community college.  I wanted to be somebody, too! I just wasn't born with a silver ''enema'' up my ass! Now don't make me do that again! Uh! Oh! Eeaagghh! Aww hell, I'm sorry, too. Who the hell could that be? .  Kenny, wasn't that your fat, racist, foul-mouthed friend, Eric Cartman?  Now, remember, if they have left-over turkey, put some in a bag and bring it home, okay?  See you in a couple of days, son. I want him out of my house! He ain't worth a shit! He can't even hold a fuckin' job! You lazy-ass motherfucker! I'll do it again!  That's the whole point, remember? Their moms ''want'' them to catch it while they're young. Nothin'. Uhco-uh, come on in, I was jus' makin' dinner.  Kenny, your little friends are here! Come play with them! I know you're sick! Now get your buns out here!  Throw your sleeping bags in Kenny's room and then come grab some dinner. Let's say grace. Okay, let's dig in. Stuart, don't even get started! That ain't why, Stuart!  It's because ''you'' are an alcoholic retard and ''he'' had dreams of not eating frozen waffles for dinner every night! What am I supposed to do with frozen waffles, clamhead?! You put 'em in the toaster and you cook 'em! Now Kevin, we ain't got enough for everybody. You have to split that with your brother. Kenny, honey, if you're going to sneeze, sneeze on them. You want some more hot water? Naw, we don't go for that hoity-toity ''rich'' folk stuff. Yehah, well, unfortunately my husband is a washed-up hunk of shit! Oh they wuz best friends; you couldn't separate 'em. Oh they jus' grew apart, I guess. I think Stuart's a little jealous that your husband got out of makin' pizzas and went on to make somethin' of hisself. Oh, ''hell'' no! He's a nugget o' deer turd. Uh-I don't know. Kenny  You share that blanket with your brother!    My Kenny used to laugh and play. He was eight years old, just like you, my Kenny was. You've gotta tell me ''what happened to him''!  You have to know something! That's right, I'm a little drunk.  My Kenny used to sing and dance, eh. Mom hit Dad again! I have no idea, dude.  Yeah.  Hey, if you wanna make him throw the ball, say this. That one's mine, that one's mine!  My waffle's d-hun, my waffle's d-hu-hun! Pass this up. Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Speech! Speech! Come on, everybody! If we all put our heads together, we can ''find'' them! Somebody stop it! Oh my God, I found a penny!  Oh, yeah! We've got to find those kids! We can do it! It's out of control! You bastard! Ohh! Noo! Hooray for Barbrady! Ohhh. AAAAAH! No! Nuh-now, who was that? That is ''not'' appropriate behavior, m'kay? Uh... That's okay, just don't let it happen again. Uh, okay, okay, that's fine. M'kay.  Now, uh, as your counselor, I'm here to tell you about drugs and alcohol and why they're bad, m'kay? Uh, so, first of all, uh, smokin's bad. You shouldn't smoke. And-uh, alcohol is bad. You shouldn't drink alcohol. And-uh, as for drugs, well, drugs are bad. You shouldn't do drugs. M'kay, that about wraps up my introduction, now uh, are there any questions? Yes, Stan? Uhhh, well, I'm not sure. Now-uh, let's focus our discussion first on marijawana. Marijawana's bad, and it also has a very distinct smell, okay? I'm gonna pass around just a little tiny bit. Now, I want you all to take a smell, ...so you know when someone is smoking marijawana near you. M'kay, just take a smell, pass it on, ...and when it gets back up to me, ...we'll finish talking about it. In the meantime, I want to get into alcohol a little, okay? Uh, alcohol is bad. Uh, if you drink alcohol you... ...and so uh, that's why alcohol is bad. Uh, ha-has that marijawana made it back up here yet? No? O-okay. Let's talk about LSD. Uh, children, LSD i-is bad. It's a drug made famous by John Lennon and Paul McCartney... Boys, are you paying attention? Okay. Now, children, has that marijawana made it around yet? Uhh, who-who has the marijawana now? Ummm okay, whoe-whoever has the marijawana, just pass it up to the front row, m'kay? Woh-oh. I'm sorry, Prinshipal Victoria. You mean I'm ''fired''?  But-but it was an honest error of judgment, m'kay? I-I really thought it was important for the kids to know the smell of marijawana-- But-- Huh, how am I going to make ends meet...m-m'kay? Wha-what will I ''do'' for money??  Not o-uho-uhokay! Uuuuuugh! Naw, I just-- I had to get away, m-m'kay? I just lost my job. Oh-uh-uh, I don't drink, m'kay? Ughuh...  Drinkin's bad.  Woah, about the same. Whoa... Is this my house? Why, Mr. Freely? No, no, no, m'kay? I-it wasn't like that. But I've never taken drugs ''either''. Huuhh? ''Ow'', m'kay?!  Uh, uh-- Whoa, wait! Hoh! I can't sleep; it's too cold, m'kay?  Oh, I didn't know this dark alley was taken. Marijuwana's bad. Ma-marijuwana makes you feel depressed and low, m'kay? Oh, good point. No, I don't feel any d-oooohh... Oh, baby, get down, m'kay? Man, this alley is cool! It's so alive and beautiful!  Oh, man, where am I? Uh, hi, boys, how are you today? Oh, I've been better. I've been kicked out of town for doing drugs. Oh. O Fortune, how you mock me?  Uh-uh, boys, LSD is bad. Hmmm... Man, who put all this cotton in my mouth? Yeah, baby... The world is so small. I'm free... I'm free... Hi, boys. Are you boys stayin' out of trouble? Okay, I-I'm just gonna go over here for a while.  I don't need to take you right-wing authoritative bullshit! Aw, you're just like the government, man! Trying to prosecute outta one side of your mouth, m'kay, while supporting guns outta the other, m'kay? I can't, man. Jerry Bear's dead, m'kay? What? Oh, thanks, man.  Sure, man. Finger-paintin's cool, m'kay? Woo, whoa! Ow! Hey! Uh oh hel-m. Hey! Uh-- What the hell is going on?! I don't want to go to rehab! I haven't even done drugs in weeks! I don't want help! But I don't think I really have a problem. I don't really have a family. No, I lost my job before that. Drugs are baad. Uhh... Dru-drugs are baad. I can't thank you enough for everything, m'kay? I feel like my old self again. I will, Ms. Social Worker. I will.  M'kay? Okay, kids? Uh, you shouldn't do drugs, m'kay? Drugs are bad. You see, I was at the bottom of the barrel. I was a wreck; why, I didn't even care about money. I was-I was wasting my life... Now boys, you need to listen up, m'kay? Wha-what I'm talkin' about might save your ''life'' someday, m'kay? M'kay. M'kay. Okay. Now, as I was sayin, uh... drugs are bad. You shouldn't do drugs. Eh, uh if you do them, you're bad. Because drugs are bad, m'kay? It's a bad thing to do drugs. So-uh so don't be bad, by doing drugs, unkay? That'd be bad, 'cause drugs are bad. M'kay? Uh, Nurse Gollum is absolutely qualified to be a-- Uh, Principal Victoria, Nurse Gollum has conjoined twin myslexia. Y-you never noticed that? Do we have to eat kosher stuff? Yeah, but you know, it-it doesn't matter though. The-the Denver team always wins, m'kay? Could I get some more pork? Th-the school could put out pamphlets, m'kay? And we could have seminars to educate, m'kay? Welcome to detention, m'kay? Mr. Garrison told me about your little joke. It's important for you all to know ''why'' you're in detention for you to obtain the full benefits from it.  You're here because you are inferior, m'kay? You are here because you are awkward, m'kay? Shh! M'kay? ''Shh!'' M'kay? Oh oh okay? Let's try to calm down, n'kay? This type of thing happens all the time. Well, 99% of the time, when a child is missing, it's because they've run away. M'kay? Well, we just need to make some posters, nkay? Hand out brochures, onkay? That way, the public can know what the chldren look like and can call in if thry're spotted, m'kay? Okay uh van Gelder-  -okay uh I'm Counselor Mackey. Have you been smokin' marijawana? Marijawana's bad, mkay? Well, I've never seen anything like this. What do you think, principal? Um. How's he doing, nurse? Drugs are good, mkay? The machine is aaaah? Uh that's probably bad. Uh, there's only one way to get any sense out of him. We're gonna have to try a mind meld, mkay? Well, it's an ancient technique handed down from school counselor to school counselor. I don't like to use it, but it may be our only hope. Just time to prepare, nurse. Just time.  Mkay? Our minds are one. Mkay? Our thoughts are one. Mkay? Please, nurse, for a woman with a dead fetus on your head, you're not being very open-minded. Open your mind to your counselor. Open your mind. Yes. Mkay? Abuh. Please, nurse, you're throwin' off my chi! Mkay? Aha! Caught you red-handed! Mkay! Officer Barbrady, uh, this man is using some kind of mind control. Oh no, apparently, he thinks he's Charlton Heston. Uh oh. Eric, you really saved the day. Mkay? Think hard, Elvis. You're not really the king of rock and roll. You're a fat, stupid, worthless policeman in a small town. Mkay? Now, young man, uh- school is a time for learning, m'kay? Not for immature skylarkings. You know, like tomfooleries. Oh, your parents are here. Thank you for coming on such short notice. I was just disciplining your son for his skylarkings. Yeahm'kay? Okay. Stanley, we're all here to get to the root of your behavior disorder. Okay, uh-- Perhaps you should let your wife finish talking, Mr. Marsh. Now, Stan, I want to you to be-- Uh. U-uh, taking over any conversation's bad.  Uuuhh. Mmm mkay. Okay uh uh uh-apparently we have a bit of a communication problem here. Uh, Mr. Marsh, tell me how you're feeling. Mkay. That's valid. Now, uh, Mrs. Marsh--  -how do you feel? Who tries to control the marriage? And by that I mean, who's dominating the aspects of the relationship? Mmkay. Whooaa..! I am ''very'' disappointed in ''you'', young man. You should be ashamed of yourself. What could have possessed you to be so stupid?  We-hell, "sorry" isn't going to cut the cheese this time, mister! I'm afraid I'm going to have to suspend you from school. Well, I guess that's the grown-up way to put it, yes. It was an error of judgment, Mr. Mackey, but ''I'm'' afraid I have to let you go for it. We searched each one of those kids, but came up empty. We had to let them go home, and one of them now has half a lid of Jamaican grass because of ''you!'' There, there, now. Maybe this will all blow over someday and we can give you a job as a janitor cleaning up vomit with that pink sawdust stuff. We were wrong for shunning you, Mr. Mackey, and we apologize. We should have realized that you needed help. You'll thank us later. Well, Mrs. Broflovski, it certainly is a thrill seeing your cheery face again. What seems to be pissing you off today? O-of course you do. Oh, and uh, what disease is that? What's that?  She does? No-o, I never did. Did you say a fetus, sticking out from her head? Well, I'll talk to Nurse Gollum, but I'm sure she'll be delighted. Let's say around 8:00? Now, you did say she has a fetus on her head? Oh. Eh, sooo, I hear that the South Park Cows are playing for the State Finals in dodgeball tonight. So did you ever think of just, you know, having it cut off? Ooohh, so I suppose that's out. Uh-how about a hat, then? Ooohh, yeess, a Conjoined Twin Myslexia Awareness Week. You know, that has a nice ring. Oh, my, what an ungrateful bitch. Well, whatever happened to him happened at the planetarium. I think tonight the planetarium is doing Laser Loggins. I might have to check it out. Oh, man, this is boring! Hey, Chef. Dude! Hi, Mr. Mackey. Yes. Eewwww! Eewwww! Eewwww! Aawwww! Hi, Stu. Hooray! Hey, Chef. Cool! Hooray! Eugh. Hey, Mackey, you got any more pot? My four-year-old needs a fix! Yehahahahaha! Hey, Mackey! Now we see what you and Homer Simpson have in common, d'oh-pe!  Ha ha ha ha! Heeey, Mac''key!'' Hey, Mackey! Why did the drug user cross the road? Who do you think you are, you stupid drug-taking hippie?! You damn hippies are all alike! Won't you leave the guy alone? Hey, hippie, are you gonna do some drugs? Hey, I don't think I've seen you around here before. Oh that's ''weak'', man. You know what you need? You need a good, stiff drink. Trust me, man! It'll make you ''feel'' better. So how do you feel? Oh, you just need something a little stronger.  Go ahead. Drink the beer. It'll calm you down.  Yeah, why the hell not? It's just a beer. Don't be such a pussy, m'kay?  Your key ain't gonna work, Mackey! I changed the locks! I'm not rentin' to you anymore! I heard that you got fired from your job for selling drugs to children! Drugs are an illegal narcotic! And having never taken drugs, I can say that they have nothing to offer! I've never taken drugs, and look at me! I'm totally fine! Now get off my property before I lose control and ''kill'' you! Drug user! Druuug user! Come back here, dammit! Your mother's made gahekgafuga. Meaning we're going to circumcise him.  Normally, we do it right after the baby is born, but we had to do it later for Ike because he's a--  Oh, now what's gotten into him? Stan, will you go talk to him? AAAGGGHH!!! Get out of here, you mutt! Let him go! There, there, Shei-hla. There's nothing we can do. He was not really a Broflovski, he was Canadian. But we loved him all the same.  Uhhh... Mind your... mother, smart-ass. Kyle, just because Ike is adopted doesn't make him any less your brother. Now you march to your room, and you think about what you've done! Apologize to him! Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Sheila, could you pass me the dead fetus? I mean, gravy. Ow! Oh, I don't know. I think our boys might just have the dead fetus to win-- Heart! Please come home, Kyle. <poem><i>You left home lookin' for somethin' new.</i></poem> <poem><i>But all you need is right here waitin' for you</i></poem> Who? Stuart? Yeah, yeah, I guess we were. Well, because Kenny's family doesn't have as much money as we do. Ha ha ha ha ha! Ooh-ho boy, have ''you'' got a lot to learn! Sit down, son. You see, Kyle, we humans work as a society, and in order for a society to thrive, we need gods, and clods. Yes. You see, I spent a lot of time going to law school, and I was able to go because I have a slightly higher intellect than others. But I still need people to pump my gas, and make my French fries, and fix my laundry machine when it breaks down. ''That's'' right. So Kenny's family is happy just the way they are, and we're all a functioning part of America. Oh, yeah, love it! I haven't done it for a while, though. I had to go out and buy a few things, you know a-. A rod and a reel and an uh, uuh... Yeah, tackle box.  Man, smell that mountain air. What a great Saturday morning; aren't weekends just the best? Right. Right-right. Huh? Oh, uh, no thanks, I brought my own. Microbrew sampler from Aspen. Has six different beers from local breweries. Sahay, remember that time we built the fort in your mom's back yard? Hahah. Whatever happened to that old hunk o' junk? Haha-- Oh, right. Well, I'm sure you'll find another job soon. Something'll come along. Now, now-I, I wasn't lucky. Hey! I worked my ''ass'' off to get to where I am today!  I wanted to be somebody! You're just jealous. You're a bitter old drunk, just like your father! Ow!!  Ow! You son of a bitch! Ow! Ow!  Huuuh! That son of a bitch ripped my parka! I just don't get it. Why would he invite me fishing and then turn into a complete bastard? What? Now why the hell would you ''knowingly'' deceive me like that? Just like you deceived our son into going to Kenny's; and that didn't work either! What?! Oh, God, what have I done? Are you doing okay? And, uh Stuart, I think I owe you an apology. I realize that I shouldn't be so cold towards people that are less fortunate than me. Now, just let me do all the talking, Chef. We’re gonna bring these bastards down. I am, Your Honor. Gerald Broflovski. Uh-oh. Chef, that's Johnnie Cochran. He's the guy who knocked O.J. off. ...And so, in summation, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you've heard the version of my client's song recorded over twenty years ago. You've heard the exact same song produced by those cheats in the past month. I'd say it's pretty much an open-and-shut case. Make the right decision. Thank you.  We've got 'em. Dammit..! He’s using the Chewbacca defense. Whoops. How was it, honey? Let us cut off you pee pee, Stan! AAAAGGGGHHHH!!!! Aaagg-that's the sickest friggin' thing-run, ruuun! Hey, you want somethin' to warm you up?  Here, try this; it'll warm you up. What? And you don't fell that way now? Uh-huh. Ohh, boy. Lincoln, Nebraska; train leaves in five minutes. That's a little brother? I thought it was a trash can or something. What's wrong with his head? I'm sorry, but we just can't throw Caucasian babies on an outbound train. What?! Why the hell would they do that? No can do, sonny. Two-year-old Canadian boy, two-year-old Canadian boy... Oh, I think they might have one of those down at Haps Bar. Can I help you boys?  Damn it! That's the ninth return I've had this week! What's wrong with it?  Ap! Let me guess. It killed a bunch of people, right? Damn it!  Well, there was an Indian burial ground here before I bought it. Oh, hell no! First I dug up all the bodies, pissed on 'em, then buried them again upside down. Why? I don't know. I was drunk. Well, that certainly would explain a lot. Well, like this.  I've been wondering what the hell this was. I can't give you your money back. No! I won't take it back! All right, you win.  Who are you? I don't know who you mean? No! Stop! You don't know what you're doing! Those pets are evil! Des Moines? What the hell for? Well, okay. Uh, I'll find him a seat. What the hell are you talking about? No! Don't kick the-- Bye-bye. Oh. Oooh. Yeah. No more walbolching! Mamatoedoe. Uh oh, stufid. Uh oh. Oh deh family nrr. I wumuh trecompr. Com. Tebruhnerr. Cookie Monster,  two, three, four, five.  Oowwww! Oh deh faminrr. Heh cohcoh mondefern menurr. Ouch. Buh-buh-buh-buh. Cookie Monster. Hey, wow, it's that counselor from elementary school, Mr. Mackey. Pretty good, man. How are you? Hey! Us, too! Oh, cheer up, bro; all you need is some clear liquid to get your head straight. That guy's totally trippin'. Dude, this is totally killer. Dude, I'm totally tripping. This way, please. Wow, dude. Yeah, remember? You caught us smoking weed in the bathroom and got us suspended. Sweet dude, totally killer. I hope this goes on for like, seven months, man. This is totally killer. Enjoy your visit. Aaaggghhh! Aaagh aaagghh! Hey, lady, that's my table post! You can't have that! Wow, man. You know, it's like… You go through life thinking that you're an individual, m'kay? And then you realize that you're more than that, m'kay. We're all just one ''big'' individual, m'kay?  M'kay.  I am one with the animals. And the trees.  Yeah I got, m'kay? Hello, Ike! Say, where's little Kyle? Hi there! Uh-no, but I never miss a bris. Here, I brought some dip.  You have to admit you have a problem before anyone can help you. Nonsense! You did drugs! I suppose you forgot all about your family. And you lost your job. Mr. Mackey, you're supposed to be an adult. The problem with drugs is that people forget to stop doing them. There's a time and a place for everything, Mr. Mackey, and it's called college! Now, I want you to repeat after me: Drugs are bad. Drugs are bad. Congratulations, Mr. Mackey. You are fully recovered. Just one more thing. Remember that you ''can'' stay sober. Oh, my pleasure, Sheila. I brought the normal cutting device, but then I remembered that Ike was Canadian, so I brought the right one. Where is the little rug rat? Come 'ere, you. Ike? Ike? There you are. Come on Ike, it's time.  Bu-bu-but, son, I just-- Kyle... a-a circumcision is a very common thing for Ike to have. His father had it, his grandfather had it, and... We're ''not'' going to cut it off! We're just goin' to snip it, so it looks ''bigger''. And-a one and-a two and-a... bris.  ...his ''brother'' had it.  Uhh... Excuse me a moment, gentlemen. I don't believe I know how to play dodgeball. Well, no. And actually, I'm not from France-- Oh, dear. Oh, what jolly good fun! Ugh... Oh, no, I couldn't. I'm not French-- Ogh! I'm dreadfully sorry! I'd love to! Hey! I get quite disturbed when you call me that! You shouldn't make fun of foreigners. And besides, I ''hate'' French people. Oh, bother. Gagghh! Gaagghh! Arrggghhh! Everyone! Everyone, look! I won the game! We're world champions! Mr. Chef, Mr. Chef. South Park is the world champion in dodgeball. Oh, glorious day! Did you all see? I can't believe I threw such a ball with my own arm. It was-- Where did everybody go? Oh, happy summer, gentlemen! Right-o. Uh... Enjoy some of this summer for me, would you? Well, I have to spend my summer in summer school, because I can't be left alone. You see, my parents are dead. Ow! Ahow-ow-ooooowww! I heard the school nurse is hideously deformed. Denver? What if we don't know anybody who was in Vietnam? Oh. I hope my dad doesn't sing.  I wanna go again. I wanna go again! Yes. Yes, please! Bitchin'. I heard she has tentacles and eats children for lunch. Gross!  Did it work? I hope so Wendy. He's got such a hot ass. Pssst! Pass this up. Kyle, could you turn around for a second? Thank you.  Come on, Wendy. Don't you guys still wanna play "Truth or Dare"? Then come on! Who wants to go first?  Okay.  Okay.  Wow, look at that ass! Shake it, baby!  Okay, Stan. Truth or Dare? Stan, Truth or Dare? Kyle, can I talk to you? Kyle, this is very difficult for me. I think we need time apart. I'm just feeling really trapped. I can't go on with this codependency. No, no. Don't speak. Just try and understand. It has to be this way. Please. Just remember the good times we had. I'll never forget you. Never. Okay, Clyde, we can go now. Okay. It's my turn. Stan? Truth or Dare? Take this stick and jam it up your peehole. Do you think it'll hurt? Are you Kyle Broflovski? I'm the school nurse. Did you hurt your nose? Young man, Why do you have your eyes closed? I'm not gonna hurt you. So open them. Now, what seems to be the problem? Oh. Well, I'll get you an ice pack. What? Oh, I see you've noticed my disorder. I have a stillborn fetus growth attached to my head. Colorado State. I-it's okay, Ms. Broflovski. Really. No, I'm quite secure with it. They're just young boys. Joking is a way for them to come to terms with what they don't understand. Yes, Principal Victoria, the thought had occurred to me. Unfortunately, it would mean my death. No, really, I don't need a-- I really appreciate what you're trying to do here, but it's not necessary. I'm a pretty happy person. But I really don't think-- You know, Mayor, I really should be accompanying those kids to Washington in case they get hurt. That is my job. Oh, no..!  Nurse Gollum. Oh, boy. Thank you, Mayor. I uhhh, wa-I... I don't know what to say; this has been quite a week. What I really wanna say is... well, -egh-- This may sound odd coming from a woman with a fetus sticking out of her head, but... you're all a bunch of freaks! Don't you realize that the last thing I ever wanted was to be singled out? I just wanted to do my job and live my life like any normal person, but instead you've made everybody focus on my handicap all week long. Look, I don't want to be treated different. I don't want to be treated special orh-or treated gingerly. I just want to be ridiculed, shouted at, and made fun of like all the rest of you do to each other.  And take those stupid things off your heads! I'll give him a pain killer. That should calm him down. He's stable, but I still can't get any information out of him. I'm gonna sedate him now. But why, van Gelder? He's been talking about "the machine" for hours. That and Daisy Fuentes. A what? Well, what will you need? This is the strangest thing I've ever seen! He owns the planetarium. What about him? But why? My God! This is amazing! What's wrong with ''him?'' Gross! The end. Hey, Chef. Ooooo! Awww... Aaaah! Aaaah- Amen. Ah-men.   You did?! SIT DOWN, KID!!

I SAID, SHUT UP!! Was it? Does it even matter? Success is hollow, Mitch, hollow like a dead tree. I think it's time for me to give it up. Ah-I'm sure. Let's get a cup of coffee. Wow, this is gorgeous. I don't think I've ever seen anything so beautiful. Please. Call me Muffin. Me too, Marcus. I've forgotten all about my cares in the world. I want to thank you for making me feel alive again, Marcus. What is it? What's wrong? Oh I know. I know, Marcus. But let me just pretend as long as I can. THAT AIN'T HOW YOU DO IT! YOU DO IT LIKE THIS: SIDDOWN AND SHUT UP!! THIS IS THE PLANETARIUM, WATCH YOUR STEP ON THE WAY DOWN SO AS NOT TO HURT YOURSEELF! Hello, there. I'm Bob Thomas, the coach for the Denver Cougars. Well, I certainly want to thank you for bringing your team down. Apparently, nobody else would play us, because they knew we'd just beat 'em silly. So I told the school board to find me some hick school from the mountains, and here you are. You're from South Park, yeah? My G-hod, amazing where people can live nowadays. Well, we might as well get this over with; we've gotta start thinking about D.C. Promise we won't make it too painful. All right, boys, just five more of the little bastards to go! Play ball! Are you Chef? The Washington team has forfeited the game. Congratulations, you're national champions. Take places! Praaayyy braal! Ow! Oh, that's not fair! He's so fat, it stuck in his belly! South Park on offense! South Park wins! Uh-hu-hu-hu-howieee! It hur-hurts! Owieee! Mommy, it huurts! I-it hur-hurts! SIT DOWN, KID!! I SAID SIT DOWN!!! WHAT DID YOU SAY?! Oh, me too.  AAAGGGGHHHH!

You mean you don't know? Last year's national champions were the Austin Pirates. They played China for the world championship. Only four of them came back alive. Chinese dodgeball players aren't like us.  They do nothing but dodgeball, day in, and day out. They use steroids and advanced training equipment to make them, not kids, but animals. Well, good luck. We've got our futures to think about. Bush langli. Woon taun. Waya ching gia! No, I'm from America. My parents are Chinese. Hiit ita wita great pride, that huwe huwelcome ourn American friend. Now let the... ...champion of dodgeball be deshide! Okay, Tom, rooks rike A-mericans are getting ready to play. I don't suppose they'll have any problems seeing the ball with their big American eyes! Oh, you say such things. Hey, hey, what do you call white American person with PhD in a physics and-a math? Stupid American! Oooh, another American is down! It's numbuh-- uuhhh... Oh, I don't know. All American look alike! Oooh, my, I haven't seen an American die like that since Abraham Lincoln! And there is-a only a one South Park prayer left. Still all Chinese prayer. This should be over veerry shortly. Yeah, yeah! Hey, hey. Let me try, let me try. I'll use my credit card. Eh-eh-uh... Do you have any non-dairy creamer? And the winner is South Park Cows! Yeah. Good thing they have those big eyes so that they don't have to rery on that amazing American interrect. That's a zinger! Ah, I don't know. What? Aw, no way!! Dude, that is-a not cool! You're gonna get us into trouble again. Hey, you wanna hear my impersonation of American? Ah, okay. Hey, I really, really want that. That looks good. Yes yes!  Y'all come a-back now, you hear? Yeah, it was left on our answering machine. All it said was that they saw the Mexican staring frog just south of Stark's Pond this morning. You were in 'Nam? Where were you stationed? Man, I was in Tet. We had a bad-ass roller coaster, but... all we ever wanted was a log ride. We waited and we waited, but... they never built us one. I think..Danforth wanted the log ride more than anybody, but he... he had to settle with that lame dinosaur water adventure ride. ...And all over America, kids are turning to the streets and running away. Tonight, a very special message from the parents of some runaway children, in hopes that their young will hear their cries. Thanks, Creamy. Police are advising all citizens to stay indoors, not breathe the ashen air, and not ever light any giant snakes in the near future. I'm here live in South Park, Colorado, where citizens from Los Angeles are arriving in droves for the town's first annual film festival. This is just a small quiet mountain community where nothing out of the ordinary ever really happens,  and so the excitement level is naturally very high. Right now, the townspeople are anxiously awaiting the arrival of some of Hollywood's top celebrities. Ladies and gentlemen, TV's Fred Savage. Well, I'm sure a real person will show up soon. I ate all mine up, silly. Ooh, good idea. Let's. It appears that more and more South Park residents are discovering the wonder and joy of the planetarium. Here with a special report is a 34-year old Asian man who looks strikingly similar to Ricardo Montalban. Oh, anywhere'd be great! Oh. Oh wait wait, I know this. What was second prize again? Now, Mary, this is our only vacation for years. We have to make the best of it. Now, Mary, you promised me we'd try to have a good time. Hoh, it's so cold here. Oh well, let's try to make the best of it, Mary. Yeah, and at least we've got our health. Come on! Throw ball! Come on! Throw ball! Thanks, you American dumbass!  "You French piece of crap! Throw ball!" "What's the matter, Frenchy? You got crepes in your ears." Shut up, Pip! 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 Awww..! Yeah. Aawwww!  Aawwww!  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 We've got to do it, J. Your ratings are being killed by the ''Jimbo and Ned Hunting Show''. Wuhell, you'd better care, Mr. Smarty Pants. No ratings means no show. If you want to keep reaching out to people, you ''have'' to keep up with the times. Remember, big, big, big!. Jesus! We're in trouble. ''The Jimbo and Ned Show'' made up some ridiculous staring frog story and jumped another two points in the ratings! I don't know. We'll have to continue with the changes we've made, and then go even further. Remember, big, big, ''big!'' Ooh, no, no, no, no! This is the biggest publicity stunt I've ever seen! ''Damn'', those hunters are clever! It's genius, it really is. Hell, I even want to watch them hunt the Mexican staring frog. Unless...  Unless we can prove to the City world that the whole thing is a sham. If we prove that the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka is just something..made up by Jimbo and Ned, we can have them taken off the air. Perhaps even killed!  Oh, J. You are so omnipotent, and yet so naive. We'll launch a full investigation, and in the meantime, we can cash in on the video tapes. Good. Okay. Okay, bye! Good news, everybody. This week's ratings are through the roof! We're up to twenty people! No, but I do. We're now the highest-rated show on Mountain Cable Access! God bless the Mexican staring frog! We'll start with a two-shot of you and Ned getting your equipment together and-- What is it? He is? You getting all this? Get the Flight for Life helicopter!  Oh, this is not good. You're ''corpses'' out here! We need a lot more action from everybody! Like, go ahead and tell how your nephew Stan takes drugs and worships Satan. And you kids! I didn't bring you on this show to be boring. Somebody get pissed off and throw a chair at Ned here. Remember, you all start to fight ''after'' the chair is thrown. That's your cue. What is this? ''What's happening?!''  Oooooohhhh! Noooooo! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! I win! You lose! Chef Aid is over, and you didn't raise near enough money to pay Cochran's legal fees. Ha-ha-ha-ha, I win! No!  Noooooooo! But I don't really care about that.  Ohh, alright. Uhhh... Hi. Uh, yeh-yeah, okay. Beginning today, we're taking the show in a new direction. We've got some very interesting people coming on the show this week for you, our viewers. Today's guest is: TV's Gilligan, Mr. Bob Denver. Hi, Bob Denver. So. Bob. So, yu-you just get in town?  So... Um... Su-so, wwhat have you been up to?  Oh boy. Yeah? Uh-oh, sssooo what are we supposed to do? If you're just joining us, we've been listening to Michelle's incredible story of survival. Go on, Michelle. And yet, somehow, he managed to survive. W-well, let's see if the audience has any questions. Yes, uhh, you over there. Kick ''who'' to the curb? But-- Uuh-I think we've somewhat missed the point here. Let's go to somebody else. Yes, your comments. Wha-what are you talking about? Uhh, we'll be back right after these messages. Uhhh, clever? Unless what? Look, why don't we just stick to our own show? People will watch again. What video tapes? Yea, children. I am the way and the light... We're back with Jimbo and his nephew, Stan. These kids can't stop lying, can't they? Is that true, Stan? Uhh, we'll find out more about this ''debauchery'' when we return. Welcome back to ''Jesus and Pals''. Jimbo, why do you think little Stanley lies? Wow. Now, Stanley, it sound like your uncle is really worried about you. O-okay, okay, that's enough. Uh, let's watch the language, people. Let's all just..make our way back to our seats. Let's all just..make our way back to our seats. Shut the fuck up! Jesus, what is wrong with you people?! Look around you, Stanley. Look at all the pain and suffering your lie has caused. The ''entire'' Vietcong Army? Is it? And as for you, Stan uh, I think you need to kick your drug habit and-- Wait. Jimbo made that up? What? Oh, really? W-wait, everybody. Come back. I want to apologize to all of you for what happened in there. In our competition for ratings we lost sight of why we got into show business in the first place. Actually, I was referring more to the pursuit of truth, but—Well, anyway, I can't wait to get back to my old show without all the glitz and the ratings and producers and--  I sent her away. Hi, Jesus. Great to be here. Yup. Just got in. Nn-nothing. Nothing really at all. Any particular prize you're hoping for? Polynesian diggities. I wish you luck. Here we go. What is the thin flap of skin that runs from the base of the penis to the scrotum? I'm sorry, but YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT! Fred tell 'em what they've won. Well, Tom, Mary, you must be very excited. That's all for now. See you tomorrow on... And we're back in five, four, three...  Well, as I was saying, I tried and tried, but my overturned car just won't budge. My husband was trapped for twelve hours. That's right. He's a very brave man, and I love him very much.  I love you, too. I think she needs to kick him to the curb, baby! Her no-good husband! She's got to lose that zero and get herself a hero! He wants to have his cake and eat it, too. He's got to dump that trash girlfriend. It's all about respect. You've gotta have respect for yourself. Montel, I think we're forgetting something very important in all of this. Okay, sure, he touched some children, but the man is a great singer and he has entertained us for so many years. Michael Jackson. All this baad-mouthin' and puttin' the man down. Maybe he did touch some children now and then, but come on! It's Michael Jackson! Michael Jackson!  Don't feel too bad, Montel. We all want to touch children sometimes; it's only natural. Ready. It's a psychosomatic response.  I couldn't help overhearing your conversation just now. I produce a little TV show called ''Jesus and Pals'', you might have heard of it. Your story is amazing; full of jealousy, duplicity, backstabbing and bitterness. How would you like to share your remarkable story with us on tomorrow's show? Jeesus! Jeesus! Jeesus! Jeesus! Jeesus! Jeesus! Jeesus! Jeesus! Ooohhhh..! Ooooooh! Ahhhhh! Boo! Boo! Hhssssssss! Yeah! Yeah! Woo!  Take that, you asshole! What the fuck was that? Oh, my God! Yeah, yeah, yeh...  Yeah, yeah, yeh-oh? Oh, Oh! Aah! AAAAGGHH!!!  Screw this show. I thought this was all real. Welcome to my dominion. Okay, honey. ...Aand right up here you can see a red-bellied chickadee. They're indigenous to this area.  What was what? Aaaah! What was that?  Welcome to tape 7 of the bus driver's video guidebook. What to do if you become stranded. By now you've calmed down the children and kept order by using the 'keep quiet or I'll kill the bunny' technique. Now, it's time to get help. The most important thing to remember is that the children will be safe as long as they stay on the bus. So do not, under any circumstances, let any children off the bus. The best way to achieve this is to tell them something like, 'A big scary monster will eat you if you step off the bus.' That's right. With the children properly subdued, you can leave the bus and go out looking for assistance. And remember your bus driver's code: 'Sit down. And shut up!' Hey, why doesn't the scary monster eat ''her''? She's never coming back. Don't you get it? She left us here to die like pigs. I can't take it anymore! I have to get out of here!  Ehah! Well, I'm not gonna sit here and wait to die with the rest of you! If I can make it back, ah-I'll send help. Nooooo-agh! Whoa uhih, it's supper time. Come to poppa. Whoa uh heh hello, little lady-yeh. Goin' my way? Whoa. Hehum huh. Uh huh. Alright, sure, of course. So uh... Uhwhat's a- fragile little doe like yourself doin' out on a, on a night like this? Uh uh- ma'am, those are actually roofies. Mm-... mm-it's a ways. Hey. Uh I wanna help you. Uh, I care a lot about that bus full of uuh- what was it again? Yeah right. Leh, let me come with you.  Say uuhh, are those roofies kickin' in yet? Damn! Are you gonna be all right? Uh ah-I'm sorry. Do you need anything? What? Honey du-, do you need anything?  Sure. Well. That was great, ma'am. Wwhat do ya mean? Are you sure? From a distance, this place looks like a cold, damp marsh. But once you get inside it... ...you realize that it has an ''inner'' beauty, far surpassing others. Thank you for sharing your time with me, Ms. Crabtree. I'm having a nice time, Muffin. Ms. Crabtree? You realize I can't stay. None of this is real: it's... it's all been a little eight-year old's dream. Sure. 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1  I hate flyin'. Talk about somethin' I hate, it's flyin'. D'you guys like impressions? Here's my impression of Robert De Niro. Hey, youse. Youse guys. Shut up, youse! Youse guys, shut up!  Come on, lady. Iii love you. You love me. No! Baby, you're wonderful! You're a natural! You're the funniest comic I've seen in yeauhs! Broken-down bus! That's great! Great angle! I'm telling you, Marty, this woman is a natural! I haven't seen a funnier person since Maury Povich. I can't even explain it. You have to see it. Come on in, come on in. Mr. Jonus, this is Mrs. Crabtree. What did I tell you? Just relax, sweetheart, you're gonna kill out there. Huh that's great. Use that.  What's her angle? Alright. Well, this better be good. Pleasure to meet you. She's fantastic. How would you like to make a million dollars, baby? Let's get started right away. Mmp right. Two million, minus your agent's fee, minus your lawyer's fee, minus my fee, and the publicity and taxes taken out, you get three dollars! That's more than most people in your position make, trust me! 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 Hi. Whoa, it smells, it smells! 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 MOMMY!  Ow. Yeah. I drove all the way from Montana to see Mr. Hankey. This is revolution!  Yeah, we don't care. Let's hear it for Ms. Crabtree. What an up-and-comer! 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 Oh golly, Kevin, honey. Uh, well, yes, but- Good to see you again, son. Hi, fellas. What can I do for you? I'm sorry, fellas. Haven't you heard? All fireworks have been banned in Colorado. It was in the paper this morning. Right. I can still sell snakes. 1 1 Awww..! At the Dyno Might Firework Company, we have a commitment to excellence. Our focus is on safety while-- Oh, o-kay.  Let's see... Now, the disk that we are making is approximately 5,000 times bigger than the average snake. We'll have to fly it in with three Comanche helicopters and lower it onto the ground at the lake.  Then we'll need 57 flamethrowers, all set up around the perimeter of the disk, that are all triggered to fire at the same time. Once lit, the snake will grow. And good times will be had by all. Die out? Uhhh, I'm not sure; I never made one this big. I guess we didn't quite think this through, did we? Let's see. A normal-size snake lasts three minutes...  November. Of next year. Okay kids, everyone in the pool! Just jump in. It's not gonna hurt ya, hon. Just do it. There you go! Now just let the first graders swim by you, and then head towards us. Eric, you have to get in the deep end sooner or later. Just do your side stroke. That's doggie-''paddle'', Eric. Now come over here! Okay. That's it! That's it, you can do it! Come on, Eric!  The pool's open! Come on, Eric, we're gonna start now. Okay, children, I'm sure we're a little rusty. Where is Eric Cartman? Oh, dear. How are we supposed to sound good without our French horn section? Oh, let's try some scales first. C scale first. And... Okay, that was pretty good. Let's play Mozart's ''Symphony No. 5''. This is it. And a-one and a-two and a... ¿Qué? (What?) ¿Necesita usted un cohete grande? (Do you need a large rocket?) Hello, is Mr. Hat there?  Yes. I don't think you can, m'kay. So, Lamb Chop, what would you like to do today? Well, I'd like to sing you a song. Shari, help me... It burns! It burns..! Hey, let's sing one to-gether! 1 1 Thanks, Tom. It looks like the firework ban won't be putting a damper on one town's festivities tonight. I'm here at Stark's Pond in South Park, where the crowd of residents and scores of tourists anxiously await the lighting of the largest snake in human history. Now, as most of you will probably remember, snakes are these little round disks that you light, and they spew out a little snake of black ash. Well, the South Park snake is over half a mile in diameter, and twenty stories high. I'm told that this event won't begin until the sun goes down and night is upon us. Alrighty then, looks like we're ready. Well, we're coming up on nine hours, and the giant snake of South Park shows no signs of stopping. Residents have tried everything from fire-hoses to yelling at it to make the snake stop, but nothing seems to work. Alright, Ned. Now we're coming up to the American border. They can't know that we have fireworks in the trunk. Just let me do the talking. Aarrgghh!! Yea, let the spirit of Heavenly Father be blessed upon you. I already feel like things are getting better. Well um, let me ask you this. Why? Wher-where do you think... Mr. Hat... went? Well… I guess, I-I see what you're saying. Yeah. Um... Ahem... Are you gay?  It-it's j-just-- It's just a question. No. Well, I believe you, I... absolutely believe you. Mr. Hat was gay? I see. That I did not need to know. What do you think about that? Mr. Garrison, I think that Mr. Hat was actually your gay side trying to come out. You see, it's-it's you that's gay, but, but you're in denial, so...you act out your gay persona with a homosexual puppet. Hi. I hasn't seen you in here before. As more and more cities are affected by the growing ash and the death toll rises to 3,000... ...people from all over the country are looking to the Mayor of South Park for answers. ...And it appears as if the Mayor is going to explain matters now. And so on this 15th day of what is considered to be the most important trial of the...day, Johnnie Cochran has appeared to defend Capitalist Records. The question now is, will Cochran use his famous "Chewbacca defense"? In a teary-eyed courtroom, Johnnie Cochran has just finished his closing arguments, and, as anticipated, he did use the Chewbacca defense. Whether or it worked... is up to the jury to decide. Chef, how does it feel to be a free man and finally have your name credited on the song, "Stinky Britches"? So, what are you gonna do now? We interrupt this broadcast for a news bulletin.  Mass murderer and extremely nasty person Charles Manson has escaped from prison! Manson was the man responsible for seven murders in the late '60's. Manson has never shown any signs of remorse for his crimes. If you see Manson, please kick his ass and smash his fucking face in for me, and then call the police. And now back to the game. A high speed car chase is happening right now on interstate 3. We go now to our live sky-fi helicopter. What about the prehistoric ice man? Dr. Mephesto, could you ''please'' tell us what's going on? Fascinating news tonight from South Park. An ancient discovery of a prehistoric man actually ''frozen in ice''. A team of scientists continues to try and unfreeze the body so that it can be autopsied, and studied. The caveman was discovered by Kyle Broflovski, who had this to say: The prehistoric ice man is thought to be from the late neo-post-Jurassic era, where he was probably part of a hunting and gathering tribe that lived on Waterston Street. You gotta be kidding me! Come on, we want answers.  Oh. All the ash from the snake is putting the flame out. Look! They put out the snake! That's right, children. I'll see you in the fall. That's right, Mr. Garrison. The First Annual South Park Film Festival begins today. Uh- that's right, Mr. Garrison. American history is very important-- Hi, boys. How are you?  Did you love him? Did you love him? Then run to him. Love isn't a decision, it’s a feeling. If we could decide who we love, it would be much simpler, but much less magical. Why do we hold the Sundance Film Festival here, Phyllis? It's so painfully crowded. No, this ''used'' to be a quaint little mountain town. ''Now'' look at it. Sushi restaurants, upscale clothes stores, $25 parking, Liam Neeson... I tell you, Phyllis, I think we've tapped this town's resources out. We must move the festival to ''another'' small mountain town and begin again. This is perfect. Why didn't we think of it sooner? This town still has some charm left, not the mess we turned Park City into. Yes. And the town after, and the town after that. Like termites, we will move this film festival from town to town until we have used it up. And then move on, until every quiet mountain town is like Los Angeles. Because ''we'' have to live in L.A. And if we can't live in quiet, simple, peaceful mountain towns, then nobody will! Waitwaitwait. Zoom in to a close-up of my face when I do that. Ready? Then NOBODY will! That's it. Ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank you all for making the First Annual South Park Film Festival a success. We've barely even started and already the festival has seen more attendance than last year's Sundance festival. And I'm very pleased to announce that in honor of the South Park people who have welcomed us, we are going to build a Hollywood Planet restaurant, right here where this library used to stand.  Make it quick. Uh-huh. We have contracts.  You try to pull out now, we'll sue your little town for every penny it's got. But thanks so much for the hard work. Not now! That's great, kid. A dried-out lump of shit; very compelling.  Okay, folks, let's move! We've gotta have that sign down in time for the opening tonight! Ladies and gentlemen, I'm ''pleased'' to announce on this Gala Opening of Hollywood Planet South Park, that the festival will be back next year! And the year after that, and the year after that, and so on! And now, release the curtain! I give you, "Hollywood in South Park!"  Oh, not this again! Anyway, this ''new'' Hollywood Planet will be the official meeting place for all-  Now, as I was saying, this shall usher in a whole new decade of film festivals.  I'm trying, damn it! Aww. Aww. Glup. Be''cause''. People from L.A. love to come to a quaint little mountain town for a few days, and this gives them an excuse. That's not a bad idea. But where? Forgive me for being observant, but, won't we just end up doing the same thing to ''this'' town? Why? Why would we do such a thing?  Come on, let's go! It's coming! Ching ching cha-ching. Whoa. Wow! Cool! No they're not! Independent films are produced ''outside'' the Hollywood system. They're movies about all the glitz and glamour of Hollywood. Once again, you have ''no'' idea what you're talking about, fatass! (Gasp)! Stan, I have two tickets for the opening film of the festival. Would you like to come with me? Stan, film festival movies usually don't have previews before them. Sshh! Come on, Stan, we're gonna be late for the screening!  Eeewww!  Stan, I'm sorry I dragged you to all those independent films. Sometimes I forget that even though a few independent films are great, most of them suck ass. Yeah, me too! Me too! Hi, Stan. Kyle, doesn't Bebe look pretty today? She does. She looks very pretty. Stan, can I talk to you for a second? Stan, wouldn't it be fun if we fixed Kyle up with Bebe? If Bebe and Kyle were a couple, then we can invite them over to your clubhouse for dinner and play parlor games and have meaningful conversations and sip cognac by the fireplace. Yeah, Stan. You don't?? I thought all guys had clubhouses. Stan, you have to build a clubhouse! Then all four of us can sit in it and play Truth or Dare! I think it did, Bebe. If all goes as planned, Kyle will be your new boyfriend. Is the clubhouse ready? Hi, guys. How's the clubhouse coming? Well, hurry! We wanna play Truth or Dare!  Hi, guys. I will. Kyle? Truth or Dare?  How about we give him Bebe?  Okay. Kiss Bebe on the lips! What's the matter, Kyle? Your turn, Bebe. Bye, Stan. Hopefully we can play Truth or Dare tomorrow. Wow, that sucks! Norma, I want to shoot the script next month with Demi Moore instead.  Well you can tell Spielberg he can kiss my ass!  I'm late for a screening, I'll call you from the theater.  Oh look, one of the natives is selling local food wares... how quaint. I would ''kill'' for some cous cous right now. Cute sign, though. What a great story-it has everything! Mmuh I take it you're part owner of this whole Mr. Hooey story, right? I want you to do a big-money deal with me. Mm-we-hell, I can see that ''you're'' the real brains of the group. You don't ''really'' need those guys, do you? Hm-that's great, kid. Let's make a deal.  It's going over really well. People are gonna be knocking my door down to get you. Hey, Chef. Aaaaah! No. Yes. Yes. Yes. Who are you to judge my womanly soul? The Goddess flames that burn in my memory aren't dark. Dare ''you call'' them dark! Here lies the Goddess truth of my body. The Goddess that cries, "Freedom!" Here is the Goddess truth of my womanly being You are my blossom, my flame. When we make love, it's like the sun is right outside the door. Then make love to me, right now  Ky-yle! Ky-yle!  Hooowwwdy ho!  Ky-yle!  Ky-yle! Hooowwwdy ho! Howdy-ho, boys. Gosh, look at yuh. You're all growin' up sho fasht. Have you all been brushing behind your teeth? And usin' dental floss? And washin' behind your ears? Oh, I just got a little cold is all. All these new people in South Park are stressful on my home. Well, you see, boys, the sewer is a fragile ecosystem. These new folks in town eat nothin' but cous cous, tofu, and raw vegetables, and it's destroying my environment. That's why, Kyle. That's why. There's only one time of year I can come to the surface, and that's Christmastime. That's why I need you boys to go for me. Don't forget to change your sheets once a week!  Oh, Kyle. Howdy-ho. Well, how did it go? Is everyone gonna stop poopin' in my environment?  Oh. I, I see. Welluh shucks, Kyle, I can't thank you enough for tryin'. Aw I can't. The sun'll dry me out. But I won't last long up above. All right, just let me get my toothbrush.  No, I'm not leaving without you. We started this together, we're gonna finish it together.  Kyle. Be-fore I go there's something I must tell you. Come clo-ser. Clo-ser. There is a-nother Sky-walk-er. Wake up. Come clo-ser. Clo-ser. Closer! One time, when you were sleeping, I put myself in your mouth and had my friend take a picture.  Kyle. Howdy-ho. That was delicious. Hooo''ooowwwdy''-ho! Howdy-ho, folks. I'm afraid my buddy Kyle was right. There's not enough room in South Park to accommodate a festival. Uh, folks, please. Little towns like this simply aren't ''made'' for friggin' films. We love havin' visitors, but golly, too many of you is hurtin' our ecosystem. Be-sides, folks, film festivals shouldn't be about what celebrities are comin' or what film is gonna get sold. It should be about people gettin' together, and watchin' movies, and about people who could never get their movies seen havin' a chance to have it watched, if only once. A ''good'' film festival should be something where we all say, "Gaw, let's forget about lawyers and managers and studios and celebrities. Let's forget ''all'' those things for just a while, and just watch some new art."  Nyyaarrrr!  Hi, Chef. Your big chocolate balls are just the trick!  Gosh. I guess I don't know my own strength. I couldn't have done it without you, Kyle. Kisses. Move aside, I can't see. So without further ado we will begin this amazing film. It's a work of blood, sweat, and tears. These are café curtains that require no sewing, and I know you all love that! Well, Tom and Mary, you've made it to the final round. Are you ready to play for the grand prize? ''Live, it's the South Park Town Hall Meeting on Public Access. Tonight's topic: Prop. 10.'' Is that Leonardo DiCaprio? Ohuh no, wait, that's not him. This could be a great summer movie. Excuse me, little boy, what's a "Mr. Hankey"? This could be the next ''Free Willy.'' Great pic, son. How much do you want for it? Does it-uh ''have'' to be a talking piece of poo? It could be a crime-fighting rabbit. Or a lovable turtle. I'd pay a ''million'' for this story!  Can we put a mon-key in it? "The Mr. Hankey Stor-" uh is Harrison Ford available for a fall pic? Keanu Reeves. Matt Damon! I'll pay two. Fred Savage! Fantastic! Mr. Hankey, I can't go on anymore. I've lost the fight. I always thought death was something glorious, but now I know that it's not.  I'll always love you, Mr. Hankey. What's this? I'm sorry, son. Let's get him to ICU. Say, Tom. Do you have any pudding left? Well then, now what do we do? Well, why don't we just explore our sexuality? Mr. Poo, if you wouldn't mind, we can't hear our chairman. If you could just turn yourself down. You're at about 7 right now, we need you at about, 3, okay? Oh my God!  Aaaaahh! Hooray!  Oh, whoo-peee! Shut up, brat!  Stop it!  Serves you right, you little brat! If I die from this, I'm taking you with me!  We're watching this! Give me the remote! Thank you, Aunt Flo. Okay. Ew! You're gonna get it now. Ooooo, Stan's in trouble!  Will Carol find out she's a fa...  She was...  Who wants to know? Ten dollars a lay, five dollars a b--   Five dollars.  Don't mention it. Well, detective. It looks like ya fooled them again.  All in a day's work, I guess. I just hope that next time, I won't have to run so much. Yeah! Hooray! AAWWWW!  Aawwww. Yes. Whoa! Yes. Hooray! Wow, don't you...? What is that? Hello, children. My name is Dr. Adams. Welcome to the plane'arium. Well, it is. But I have a bone disease which impedes my ability to pronounce the "t" in "plane'arium". Yes. Perhaps someday I can get a bone-marrow transplant. Yes, little boy? Well I don't know. But anyway, boys and girls, soon you'll be witnessing the wonders of the universe. But first, I wanna show you how the plane'arium works. Ughuh, little Missy here runs the big projector for us. Come on. Let's get into the plane'arium, shall we? Good morning, children, and welcome to the plane'arium. We're going on a fascinating ride through the universe, so I want you to lean back in your chairs and get comfortable. And now I'm going to dim the lights and let the stars... eh-come out. Here we see the constellation called, "The Big Dipper". If I project a drawing of a big dipper on top of it... ...we see where this constellation gets its name. These stars over here form the constellation of Taurus, the Bull... ...while these stars form the constellation, "Roger Ebert". And these two little stars over here form the constellation The Crusades. Now, stars are actually made of hot gas, which is exactly what comes out of... And now breathe deep as the stars sloowwly start to move in little circles. I know you think plane'ariums are boring, but I'm gonna try to change the way you think about that.  Goodbye, children. Thanks for visiting. Don't forget: we have Laser Rock shows at night here at the plane-'arium. This week it's Laser Kenny Loggins and Laser James Taylor. You will not remember what happened here. To remember it will cause incredible pain. Incredible pain! Incredible icky paaiin! Well, children, I'm so glad you came back to learn more. Well, I'm sure we're going to have a marvelous time. Won't we, children? Billions of stars and billions of galaxies make up our universe. Here you see Polaris, the dog star. Certainly, Mr. Garrison. You love the planetarium! To be without the planetarium causes you horrible pain! All you want to do is help the planetarium thrive! To not do so makes your stomach ache with needlelike stab- ...and right over here we see the constellation Orion. Orion's belt is made up of three stars, one of which is actually a pulsar... Goodbye, children. Thanks for coming. Well, Clyde, if you like the plane'arium so much, perhaps you'd like to do some volunteer work here. Mr. Garrison? Excellent! Why don't we step over here and I'll show ''all'' you children how to volunteer. Thank you. I'd like to open an invitation to all South Park residents to come see a special free show this evening. I guarantee, it will change the way you think about the plane'ah-arium. Oh. Hello, officer of the law. What brings you out here? Oh, really? Actually, this is a pretty inopportune time. Of course, officer. Come on in. Would you like to see the stars, officer? And this is the constellation called Cassiopeia.  And now, officer, from this moment on, you will think that you are Elvis Presley. To not be Elvis will cause you great pain. You see, children? There's no stopping me. Even your highly intelligent policemen are no match for me. Why? Because nowadays kids have computers, surround-sound television. They've forgotten all about plane'ariums. But I'll make them remember, starting with the two of you! No, you idiot! He thinks he's Elvis.  Elvis, escort our guests to the plane'arium. And now you'll remember nothing, except that the planet'arium is the best thing you've ever known! Aa''ah.'' Aa''ah.'' Aa''ah.'' I love my work. I love my work. Aaah! Waaaah!  My... name... is... vvan... G-gelder.  Nnno! Nn-don't go back! Nnno! Eegh! Don't take me back there! I can't... can't... Aaaagghh.  Aagh! The planetarium! Haah! Nno! Nnno pain killer! I'll be okay! Nnnaa''aah!'' Eh must... tell... the machine. The machine is... e-e-e-ghe gheh- Haah! Planetarium! Nnaaah! Nno! No drugs. Nno! Don't let them g-go... planetarium! The machine. The machine is aaaah. Wha- why in ''America's Funniest Home Videos''? Why?  Dr. Adams. Do you think I might win, Mommy?  Did you hear that, Mommy? I hope so, honey. Then perhaps we can eat for a little while. Come on! Perhaps we can get some food in our stomachs! Me too! And me! Me too! I wanna do it! I'd ''love'' to work here. I'd like to tape the show! Yeah, me tohohoo. Plahanehetaharium's gahahay! P-huh pass this h-up.  Thank you... uh, Peter. We'll let you know very soon. Next will be uuh, Eric Theodore Cartman.  Well, Eric Cartman, that certainly was... insane. We'll let you know. Jesus, where do we find these people?! Well, we'd certainly like to thank all our finalists. Only one of our finalists can win the grand prize and... unfortunately, that finalist is Eric Cartman. You were actually our last choice. Uh the other children have unexpectedly taken jobs as volunteers at the planetarium. He uses the machine. The star machine. He uses it to erase minds. Planetarium, about to go out of business. Adams had to create slaves to survive. That's odd. Thanks, Tom. Yes, indeed, the planetarium has become very popular as word spreads that it really isn't as lame and stupid as one suspected. I'm here with the planetarium operator, Dr. Adams. So, bring the whole family to the plane-*tarium* for a night of excitement and wonder. Okay. Let's shoot the commercial. Where's our Cheesy Poof talent? Okay, roll camera, aaand action. Aaand action. Hold it! Cut! Could we get some more light on that backdrop? Okay. Here we go, aaand action. Cut! I'm not liking the shoes. Could we change the shoes? Sure thing. Got it.  Hello? Oh, hello, Eric. Grandma sure has missed you. Oh, I will, Eric. You know, I remember when I was a little girl and had my first talent show audition for- Hi, Eric. Grandma got you a present. It's inside. He's not fat, he's big-boned. Here you go, Eric. Hap-py Holidays!  Yes. I thought that would look really good on you. You look good, Howard. Where's your manners, Howard? We haven't even said grace yet. Mom, will you do the honors of saying grace? No, Jimmy, that's Grandpa's pot pie!   Eric, I need you to take care of your cousin Elvin for a while. Won't yo do it for Grandma? Oh, that looks a lot like ''your'' car, Harold.  Oh, hello kids. Having fun-? Alrighty, then.  Howard! Oh, look. Police Chief Stevens got a new haircut. Oh, of course we forgive you, son. It was nice of you to pop in for the holidays. Hello? The-uh Marshes aren't in right now. Please leave a message. Hello, you've reached the Broflovskis. Please, leave a message. Lame. Well, let's begin, shall we? Hey hey hey. What's goin' on, Rudy? I'll lose weight when I feel like it, bitch! Shut yo bitchass mouth, ho! You think you're slick, you punkass blasphemous dope-fiend bitch! I had my jimmy whacked seven times last week! I'll bust a cap in yo n***a ass, shithead! Heeyy hey hey. What's goin' down, y'all?

Pass this up. I'llba poppa yourba bitcha assa tooba, bitcha. Hi. We ran away from home. Oh well, I guess it beats living at home. So, I'm on my way out the door, and she goes, "Make sure you're home before midnight!" And I go, "Listen, bitch! I don't need my mother giving me no curfew!" And she goes, "Yeah, well, if you're not home before midnight, don't bother coming home at all!" So I go, "Fine! I won't come home!" And then she goes, "Fine! Don't come home!", getting all up in my face and crap and acting all tough and crap. I'm sixteen. I should be able to do what I want when I want. I don't need her breathing down my neck every two seconds telling me what I can and cannot do! I think you should be able to move out legally when you're fourteen. Yeah, it's my body. My mom always gives me shit for smoking, but it's my body. I should be able to do whatever I want with it. Oh hey, Scott. What? That game's for kids. Well like, this kid told us we might be able to crash at your clubhouse for a couple of days.  Our moms won't even let us smoke. Uh- we invited some people over. Hope you don't mind. Hello, son. Hello, Stanley. I know this must be a very difficult period for you right now, and the adjustment is going to take some time. But I'd like to be your friend. So when you're ready, I want you to feel free to come to me with anything you might need, whether it's advice, or- just someone to play catch with. You can count on me. Oh, Jesus! When are you gonna cut me some slack, huh?! I have taken you under my wing and done my best, and all you ever do is whine and moan about it! Now, for the last time, go cut some firewood! Son, could you please help me with the firewood? When will you let me in? Let me love you?! Now, get your ass out here and help me. Nnuuhunuuhh. Chores. Do chores. Well I'm not your dad. Okay? I'm ''not'' your dad! You- you can't just go around playing games with my emotions. Sharon? Sharon, have you seen my copy of ''Harper's?'' Meet me at the clubhouse. Sharon-- Guh-ow! Uh. Ey! Uh. He- Hello? Sharon? Hello? Hel-lo? Could- could somebody get me d-? Hello? Hello? I sure am hungry. Anybody? It certainly does suck right here. Hello? Shuh- Sharon? Sharon, hello? Hi, handsome. We're gonna be at Larry's Bar tonight. Hey, girls. What's up. Maaan, Fat Abbot. My stepdad popped me in my eye. Really? You're right, Fat Abbot. Thanks! Well, Fat Abbot and the gang sure done learned somethin' today. If you have a stepdad ridin' your ass, just snatch his ass in a bear trap. Grine! No more stepdad. See ya next time eatin' the pudding. Hey, kid, give me some of those! '''''Mosh pit!''''' We're ready, Bob! Well, Hawaii's nice, but Tahiti would be fun, too! The upper vascular hood. Where? Ah shit! This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen! Oh you're right. I'm sorry, honey. We just need to stay positive. That ride wasn't very good. You're right. I'm sorry, honey, I'll try and have a good time. Where are we going to put a 60-foot tall statue of a cow? Oh my God! Where is that sheriff?! We need water! You're right. We're not being positive. At least we get some time alone. Tom and Mary, put on your cowboy hats, because you're going to beautiful South Park, Colorado! That's right, just in time for Cows Days, the world's 45th biggest rodeo and carnival. Every fall, South Park celebrates Cow Days, and you're gonna be a part of it. You'll stay at the fabulous Super 7 hotel on Bernhardt Road, and enjoy festivities, including prizes, rides, and of course, the world-famous Running of the Cows! Congratulations, Tom and Mary. Ooo, What The Hell Is That! Hey, come on over here, kids. Win fabulous prizes. Sure they're real. They're even made in Canada. Yeah, look. They're even signed by Terrance and Phillip themselves.

The Chamber of Farts has been fixed and is reopen! I tell you, Mitchell, I ain't never seen nothin' like it. Just right up over this ridge. That's what they've been doin' all morning, just sittin' there and mooin'. And more cows come all the time.  Hmm. Cow cult. Here they are, just like we told you.  I reckon we should get some help. Where are they again? Well, I ain't never seen this before, neither. But I know one thing, when cows start gettin' together, it can't be good. They might start formin' a cult! I reckon. Yeehaw! Yehoo! Yeehaw! Aaaaaaaa! Freeze, cows! The game is over! You will now return to your respective towns! You will now all march in an orderly fashion into this trailer! Move! Oh, dear Jesus, no! This is the first mass cow suicide I've seen in- at least eight months.  Are you Alphonse Mephesto? We understand that you are currently in possession of the prehistoric ice man from 1996. We would like to...  we would like to offer our services in your experiments. Habitat? Amazing. He looks so much like us. Dr. Mephesto, we realize that scientific study is expensive. We want to help you make this project more... lucrative. It's easy. How so? He would be more scared on the outside. Do you think this stuff freaks him out? How do you think he'd react to what's happening in the government right now? No, that's impossible! How ''could'' he have? Damn it, ''Damn it''! Yes, and if he isn't found, we won't be able to use him for our military war- Right. Nothing.  Butlutlutlutlup! ''We'll'' never track him down on our own. This calls for some special assistance. We have to get him back. Well, can you do it? Well, where the hell is he? We've got to get him back to the lab.  Yeah. The train station? Then he's trying to ''go'' somewhere. The train!  Let's get him!  We've gotta stop that train!  Stop the train! I said, stop that train!  Cut him off! Where's the ice man?!  Damn! Well, so much for our plan to use the ice man to take over Sweden. What? Nothing! Mooooo! Moo! Oh, you boys are back again, huh? Aw I ah- I tell you what, boys. Uh, I'm gonna be really nice and just- trade you the 5000 for the Terrance and Phillip dolls. Hey, it's just a stupid rodeo! What do you expect? Yeah! Bye, Ming Li. Thanks again. Hmm… I really so no resemblance between that song and "Stinky Britches" by our artist, Alanis Morissette. I am above the law! Mr. Chef, I’m afraid you leave me no alternative. We’re going to sue you. Yes. I suggest you get a real good lawyer. We’ll have the best in the business. And that chair, too. I want that chair. You heard the judge. Since you lost the case, I can seize whatever I want to pay my legal fees. Yeah, take that water cooler, too. Take this, too. I can take whatever I want. I am above the law! I told you not to mess with me.  You wouldn’t. That doesn't matter, because that money belongs to me! I am above the law! What are you bastards doing? Oh, yeah? We’ll just see about this! We’ll just see how long this Chef Aid thing lasts. This court is now in session. Who's representing the defense? And representing the prosecution? Mr. Johnnie Cochran, your closing arguments.  O-kay, then. How find you the jury? Mr. Chef, you have been found guilty of harassing a major company label. The full fee of two million dollars will be handed over within 24 hours. Well, you have 24 hours to find it, or else you have to go to jail. For eight million years. Oh, sorry. You'll got to jail for four years. I am, Your Honor. Ladies and gentlemen of this supposed jury, Chef's attorney would certainly want you to believe that his client wrote "Stinky Britches" ten years ago, and they make a good case... hell, I almost felt pity myself. But, ladies and gentlemen, of this supposed jury, I have one, final thing I want you to consider. Ladies and gentleman, this is Chewbacca. Chewbacca is a Wookie from the planet Kashyyyk. But Chewbacca ''lives'' on the planet Endor. Now think about that. That does not make sense. Why would a Wookiee, an 8-foot-tall Wookiee, want to live on Endor with a bunch of 2-foot-tall Ewoks? That does not make sense! But more important, you have to ask yourself: "What does this have to do with this case?" Nothing. Ladies and gentlemen, it has nothing to do with this case! ''It'' does not make sense! Look at me, I'm a lawyer defending a major record company, and I'm talkin' about Chewbacca. Does that make sense? Ladies and gentlemen, I am not making any sense! None of this makes sense! And so you have to remember, when you're in that jury room deliberating and conjugating the Emancipation Proclamation... does ''it'' make sense? No! Ladies and gentlemen of this supposed jury, it does not make sense! If Chewbacca lives on Endor, you must acquit! The defense rests. Wait!  Mr. Chef, this music has really touched me. I like to take up your case, free of charge! I will. We'll see you in court, Mr. Record Producer. Ladies and gentlemen of this ''supposed jury'', you must now decide whether or not to reverse the decision for my client, Chef. I know he seems guilty, but ladies and gentlemen, this... ...is Chewbacca. Now think about that for one minute. That does ''not'' make sense. Why am I talkin' about Chewbacca when a man's life is on the line? Why? I tell you why. I don't know. It doesn't make sense. If Chewbacca does not make sense, you must acquit! Here, look at the monkey. Look at the silly monkey. We find the defendant, Jerome "Chef" McElroy... guilty as charged. Uh, it's actually for four years. Can I help you? No, I’m one of his butlers. ''Sir'' Elton John. I was knighted, you know. I'm sorry, but I'm not a big candy bar fan. Chef? You mean ''Chef''-Chef? Of course. I haven't seen him for so long. I remember when I first met him. It was about 25 years ago. I was a struggling musician who couldn't get a break. And so I got Bernie to write my lyrics. And if it wasn't for Chef, I would never have had a career in music. Yes, of course. I'll buy three Crispy Yum Yums. Sure, kid. But I would retain exclusive worldwide rights,  including-but-not-limited-to-Asian-territories, with-a-twenty-percent-commission-from-all-domestic-sales, and-sole-ownership-of-any-and-all-publishing. Tell Chef I said hi. Howdy ho, boys. It occurred to me that you might need some more help raising money for Chef. So I called a few friends, and we all decided to come over. I see you've got a stage all set up for us. Then, let’s rock and roll! Or something similar. Thank you all for coming to help Chef. This is a song written by a very special little boy. I have no idea what his name is, but who the hell cares? Anyway, he wrote it for his girlfriend. <poem><i>Wake up, Wendy!</i></poem> <poem><i>Smell the coffee...</i></poem> 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 Yeah. What the hell do you want? What's this for? Chef's in trouble? Do I? I owe everything to Chef. You bet. Give me a box of Nilla Yum Yums and a couple of Berry Bars. 1 1 1 1 1 1 All right, let's get this show on the road! Come here, baby! Sex toys? Like what? How does it work? Really? Well, hell, let's give it a shot. Sure. I'll do anything for Chef. Give me a box of those Choco-Numbers.  <poem><i>Mmmmm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mmmm</i></poem> God bless you, Chef! Sure you are, Chef. I'll give a hundred more for another romp. You're telling me that students from Mr. Garrison's class actually did something that had some kind of relevance to the world? Mr. Garrison, the guy with the puppet? Well, I must say, Garrison, perhaps you're not as stupid and crazy as I always ''tell'' people you are. Well, I can't just shut them down, this is a free country. Look, the best I can do is create a proposition. We'll call it Prop. 10. The town can vote on it, and if it passes, we'll see what we can do. So I guess you wanna do some campaigning. <br>  Alright, what's next.  All right, men, we'll throw up the stage here. Before the vote we'll get a band ''every''one likes, like uhhhh, like... Like Toto. And then the Harbucks guy will have five minutes to speak and the boys will have five minutes to speak, and then the town votes. Sure sure sure, be my guest, knock your socks off. All right, you, it's time to go. Let's go. I don't tell you how to do your job, don't tell me how to do mine. Hey, there he is! That's Charlie Manson!  Come back here, God damnit!  Fudgecicle!   Tell him we ''won't'' shoot him, Boss. 1-Marshmallow, 2-Marshmallow,...  Hooray! Okay, thanks for coming to Chef Aid, everybody! Are you ready to rock 'n' roll?! Whoo! All right, let's get things going with... Rancid!  Ran-cid! Rick James, ladies and gentlemen! And now here's your favorite band, Primus! Whoo! And now, here’s Joe Strummer!  Whoo! Whoo! And now, here he is TV's Ozzy Osbourne! And now here’s Ween! And now, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Elton John! Whoo! <poem><i>California sun has sunk</i></poem> <poem><i>I was hiiiiiigh on junk--</i></poem> We're damned proud to be here to support our good buddy, Chef. It was Chef who told us in the early days, to keep trying and to keep pursuing our dreams, no matter how much we sucked. I love that man. You know, when The Clash were on tour and we lost the beat, Chef would be like at the side of the stage going, "Don't forget, pump your loins, children." You know, that was like his motto or something. <poem><i>It's a shocking world</i></poem> Welcome to Chef Aid, Chef!  Hello! We're all here to help our good friend, Chef, who has touched our lives in the past. I remember when I was just starting out, Chef suggested I buy a pompadour hat. I thought he said, "Bite the head off a bat", so I did. And the rest, oh, it's just history. Now, let's go crazyyy! <poem><i>Ain't nowhere to run!</i></poem> <poem><i>Ain't nowhere to hide!</i></poem> Aarrggghhh!!! We're thrilled to be part of Chef Aid. No, dude, that was Steve's idea. I don't know, dude. I thought you knew him. Chef was the guy who told us to do a country album. Oh. Then who's Chef? Oh, well. Anyways, here's our song! And what happened then? Well, in South Park they say... Johnnie Cochran's heart grew three sizes that day. Hooray! Hello, Stanley. Remember me? Hey, Stanley. I brought you and Shelly presents. Okay, Shelly. This one's for you. It's a television/CD player/surround sound home theater. Your very own fish.  Come on Shelly. Let's hook up your home theater.  Do you not like your goldfish? I'm sorry. I'm a bad aunt.   Sharon! Look at you, with your little shovel. Just like when you were twelve.  Ooh, hello, boys. I'm Stan's Aunt Flo. Nn-oh.  I got it from the pet store, Stanley. Let's see. I believe it was called "The Indian Burial Ground Pet Store," just outside of town. I know I have the address written down somewhere.  Let me look.  Hi, Aunt Flo.  Wow, you don't see this every day. It's like I'm looking in a mirror. I'm sorry I caused so much trouble. This is all very strange to me, too. Well, I was just standing around, and Stan and Kyle were being really mean, as usual, and Kenny had just bought a new car. This is amazing! I can't believe how nice you are, Chef. In my world, you're a skinny, white insurance salesman. I'll help you, Stan. Can do! I don't see any pet stores called "Indian Burial Ground."  What's so funny about that?   You guys, I found the pet store! Listen, friend. You can't sell people pets like this. You have to have a sign that says, "Warning: these fish are from an evil, parallel universe." Now, it's not our fault you disrespected the bodies of this land's native people, but by golly , you're gonna take this fish back.  Move your store, and let these great people of the Wampanoag rest in peace. No, Kyle. Murder is never an answer.  Hey, you guys. We still have time to enter the pumpkin-carving contest. Come on! I bet that together we can make the best pumpkin ever! Yuh, thanks, you guys. I certainly like you a lot more than in my evil, parallel universe.  Let's use Kenny's squash. Hooray! Oh, no!  Stan and Kyle have come to take my back to my world, and I don't ''wanna'' go back!  Please! Well, good-bye, you guys. It's been fun.  Meow. Meow. He was here! Cartman was just here! Aha! There you are, Cartman!  Hey! What's wrong with you, Cartman? What the hell's goin' on?! Cartman never hits us! Yes!  Thought you could get away from us, huh, Cartman?! It's time, Cartman! Prepare for gingerification!  The gingerification gun!  Give me that gun, kid!  We're looking for Cartman. The trail ended here. Where is he?  We're here to take you back, Goody Two-Shoes!  Come on, Mr. Wholesome! We're taking you back to ''our'' universe! Hall right! Just stand there, Cartman! This gingerification gun will send you back to ''our'' universe! Shut your trap, kid!  I am!  He is! Time is running out. You'll have to destroy us both. It's the only way you can be sure. We have to both go, for the good of the world. How did you guys know? What?!  ''Through white and drifted snow'' ''Over the meadow and through the woods'' ''To Grandmother's house we go'' Look at how big you've gotten! Well, this is what the holidays are about. Family. Well, what does your family do for the holidays, Stan?  No, Jimmy, this is my pot pie!  No, Jimmy! That's a bad Jimmy! Yes. Now, watch that ass in prison, son.  Nice to have you heuh.   Oh, which one is ''he'', then? God-damn it, why the hell do ''I'' always have to say grace? If one more person asks me to say grace, I'll be like, "Eh! I'm not ''saying'' grace! And if you ask me again, I'll kick you square  in the nuts!" Sshhhh! We're watching television.  Sweet.  Sweet.  Kick ass! You guys, seriously! Mr. Hankey kicks ass! Kickass!  ''No I don't!'' ''Come on, let's eat already! They gave me extra bread and water!'' Yeah, well I'b I busted out.  Sshhhh! You can't let the rest of the family know I'm here. If it's okay, we're just gonna hang out here for a couple of days with you kids.  Another inmate busted out with me. Don't worry, he's a good guy. All right, Chuck, but we gotta lay low for a while. All right, Chuck. Let's watch some TV or something.  Hey, bring us down some food, all right? Chuck, can you turn that thing down? Okay, Chuck! Thank you very much!  Wow, sweet! What's the matter? Oh, bummer. Uh, that's okay, Chuck. You just keep watching Christmas specials.  The cops are here!  Get down, Ma! What the hell is wrong with you, Manson? You're acting all funny! Everybody just sit down and shut up! We're not going back to the big house! Wow, she's really pissed. Damn it! What are we gonna do? Damnit, Dad, why didn't you put a back door on this house?! That's it! We're going out the bathroom window! Come on, Manson! Come on, damn it!  Well, it's good seeing you all. Don't move until we're gone or I'll shoot you dead. Happy holidays.  All right, it's open! Let's go! All right, kid, you can come. Now, let's go.   What?! Now can we go?? Oh, weak!  Well, I guess I'll be going, Mom and Dad. I hope you can forgive me. I always do. See ya, Eric. Thanks for all your help. Oh. Hey, Eric. I didn't think anybody'd be down here.  It sucks, just like all your other books.  Shut up!  I can't wait to get out among the pigs  and raise some hell. When I stand up on the mountain and say, "Do it!", it gets done! And it it don't get done, then ''I'll'' move on it! And that's the ''last'' thing in the world you want ''me'' to do. You know what the spirit of Christmas is? It's another lie, from the lyin' pigs that consider me the witness-! Heyyy! I'll take you!  Hey, I didn't bust out of prison to be locked up in somebody's basement! I want some action!  Come on! I'll hot-wire your Grandpa's car! All right, boys, keep your heads down!  We're goin' to the mall!  How would you like to come with me to a more secluded part of the mall?  Folks need to understand that I ''am terror''! I ''am fear''! I am-! Oh, hey look, another holiday special.   Well, how was it? Oh, I'm sorry. Uh, I went to a beauty parlor and had my tattoo redone.  Look! Oh. He's... ''around.'' Come on, I'll buy you kids an orange Smoothie. Run for your lives, boys!  Keep your heads down, kids!  They're gaining on us!  Get in the house! Hey, man, don't point a gun at your own mother!  I'm glad I'm not ''you'' right now, kid. But I gotta see what happens. Huh?! But Stan, your mother and father are out there! Stan, I wanna talk to you about family.  You see, I had a family once. At least, I ''called'' them my family. Really, they were nothin' but a gang of people I thought were my friends. Ah after we killed a bunch of people together, I realized that my real family was who took care of me, and who took the time to care about what I did. If they don't care about you, would they have driven nine hours to Nebraska? No, Howard. You go ahead. I've got something to say.  Folks, I apologize for this whole mess. I'm going to surrender. Somebody show the police a white flag.  Oh my God, they killed the little orange-coat kid! Good! I deserve to!  is an answer. You see, I get it now! I finally understand what the holidays are all about. Boys, don't you see? You can't let things get you down during the holidays, because being happy is what the holidays are all about! You're darn right I do.  "And I guess that's what I've learned. I'm sorry for what I did, but that doesn't make up for it. I deserve to be in jail. All I hope is that I don't make mankind lose faith in itself. Yes, there's murderers in the world. There's rapists and thieves. But those are the vast minority. The majority of mankind is made up of caring people, who try every day to do what they think is right. And that's the spirit of the season." What do you think, guys? Well, Guh Good night, you guys. Happy Holidays. What was that?  You-oo you just can't buy people, Mr. Potter, wuh. Why, you know what you are? You're a little bitch.  That's right, you're a bitch, and I bet you'd like to suck it, wouldn't you? Oh, Mary. Mary, you're real! Hello, movie house!  Hello, burger parlor!  Come on, Team! Not now, Eric.  Hold him! He has him! Where's the flag?! I said "no," and I mean "no!" Respect my authorituh! What?! Quiet down, we're watching television.  Yeah!'' Oh, weak! Happy holidays.  All right, boys, you're up next. Welcome to Mr. Hankey's Happy Lollyland!  You boys want your picture with Mr. Hankey? Howdy ho, boys. Gosh, you boys smell like flowers. Sure I am! Howdy ho! Well, Mr. Hankey has to grow too, you know. Howdy ho! It's okay, kids. I'm real. Hoowwdy ho!  Look, kid. There's Mr. Hankeys like me in every shopping mall. There is no ''real'' Mr. Hankey. Huh?? Ow! Ow!  Wah-hahow! Get out!  You lied to me, Mother. You said it was the ''real'' Mr. Hankey. I will not forget this, Mother. I will not forget this, ever.  Uh oh, they're rioting again.  What's happening? Some kid must have said it wasn't the real Mr. Hankey again.  Ron, it looks as though the chase is proceeding west down the interstate. We understand that Charles Manson is inside the car with several hostages, all of whom are children , the creamy bonbon s'mores in a delightful cookie crunch. Oh my God, it's Charlie Manson! Whoa! What's going on? How did you get out, son? Well, Howard, you've done it again! You've ruined Christmas! Well, there's that old window in the bathroom; you could probably squeeze through there.  All right, Manson, we know you're in there! Come out peacefully, and we'll shoot you!  This is Robert Pooner reporting live from Nebraska, where escaped convict Charlie Manson has walled himself up in a house. . Remember, if it isn't Palmoral, you're gonna get cancer. We've got a critical situation, ma'am. Charlie Manson is holding everybody inside hostage. Yes, ma'am.  Come out with your hands up!  All right, Manson, this is it! We're coming in after you! There's gonna be a lot of bloodshed, and a lot of innocent people are gonna die! You've got until 100-Marshmallow to come out! Look out, he's got a white flag!   They're surrendering!  You're going back to prison to rot, Manson! What?? Stop that.  Happy Holidays, Bob. Come on, Manson. You belong in jail.  Still more developments in the Manson hostage crisis. Uh, it appears now that eight-year-old Stan Marsh  is in BIG, big trouble. He apparently disobeyed his parents, left home without telling them, and uh, Tom, his- his mother is very disappointed with him.  And so, Manson is hauled off to jail to rot in his cell. Everything is back to normal, and I guess the only thing left to say is, God bless us, everyone.   All right you, spread 'em!  ''Happy happy happy happy holy happy happy happy<br>Holidays'' Happy Holidays, Chief.  AAAghah heheh. Yuh-ugh! Wagh!  AAAaaagh. Ugh, ugh, huh, aarrrnnn. Aaarrrhaharn. Uuurrnnn, too much pressure! The gnomes!  We can do our report on the gnomes. The underpants gnomes. The little guys that, that come into your room late, late at night and steal your underpants. They come out at 3:30 in the morning. Most people aren't up then, but I am. I can't sleep. Ever. No!! Sleep at my house tonight; I'll prove it to you. UUuuUunh! What do you mean?! Mwaaah! Slavery? Uunnnnhh!  What if my parents go out of business? Uh what'll I do? But we'll starve and die like dogs. I just have grounds. Urgh. Uh maybe, maybe it was all in my head. Maybe I'm going insane! ''Oh no I'm going insane!'' There they are!  Arrgghh! They took them again! Why do they torture me like this?! Why can't they leave me alone?! They took my underpants again! Soon they'll want my blood! ''Blood! Euuggh!''  Uurrgh! Uunh, it's too much pressure! Waagh! I need coffee. Dad! The metaphors, man! Agghh! Uuhhh, no way, man! That is way too much pressure!  Aaarrrnnn! Wagh! Didn't you see them!? Jesus, man, Jesus! What are we gonna do, huh?! ''[screen right to screen left] Aarrgghh!'' Jesus, dude! I'm to blame for all this! I'm to blame for everything!  Waagh! You guys! Sshhhh!  ''They're taking my underpants!<br>["We won't stop until we have underpants<br>Yum tum yummy tum day"]''   Waggh. Aggghhh! ''I can't take that kind of pressure. No, Sweet Jesus, ple-hehease!'' Hello there, customer. Hello. How are you today? I'm actually interested in something else. I'm John Postum from the Harbucks Coffee Corporation... Great. What can I get for you? Large coffee, small coffee?  Oh, you're that corporate guy who's been calling. Oh, forget it, my store is not for sale. Uh, I don't think so. My coffee shop is worth a lot to me. The answer is still no, Mr. Postum. You see, when my father opened this store 30 years ago, he cared about only one thing: making a great cup of coffee.  And that's why Tweek Coffee is still home-brewed from the finest beans we can muster. Yes, Tweek Coffee is a simpler cup, for a simpler America.  But that could put me out of business. Hi, Officer Barbrady. Oh, just some dong. What can I get for you. Bye-bye. They want me to sell the store, and it's so much money. I know, but if they open a Harbucks right next door, we might go out of business. They really have my balls in a vice grip.  Country fresh, like the morning after a rainstorm. Oh. I've got one for you. How about doing a report on how large corporations take over little family-owned businesses? No, I'm- serious, hon. These boys should learn how the corporate machine is ruining America. You see, I own a coffee shop and now a great, big, multi-million dollar company is going to move in and try to take all my business, which means I may have to shut down and sell my son Tweek into slavery. Yes, slavery. They really have my balls in a salad shooter. Wuh-okay, but corporate takeovers is a much more fertile subject. Actually, honey, I think those little tykes are just what we need. I've got an idea.  How's the report going, boys? Oh, do you need some more coffee? Well, boys, uh. I don't mean to pry, but, if you want it, I wrote your report for you. Yes, it's all about corporate takeovers. Of course, you don't ''have'' to ''use'' it. Alright.  And it can be our little secret about who wrote it, right? Now, when you give the report,  <br>And when you come up to do it a second time, really, really clear it up, I mean, um, really, really play the sympathy angle. They'll like'' that. They'll be calling you, and you'll get a passing grade for it. My pleasure. G'night, boys. Yes, it is.  Oh, hello, son, uh. How did your report go? ''Real''ly?? Well, son, you might have just saved the family business. What do you have to say about that? I know how you boys feel. . What? Oh, sorry. Here you go.  Oh, hello committee members. What a surprise. Yes. How did you hear?  Oh, you'll do fine, son. Wow, it it's great! What do you think, hon?  Hon? What's the matter? What do you mean? But, kids are great to get people on our side. Honey, all's fair in love and war.  And coffee. Hon? Hu-hon?  Uh, Mr. Postum, I'm afraid you've got a lot to learn about making coffee. Uh, I'm sorry to inform you that this town is having a vote tomorrow, and if the law passes, you're gonna be thrown out of town. At five o'clock, the best coffee wins. Either your coffee, or a fresh, warm cup of... ''Tweek's'' coffee.   Hey. Hey, that ''is'' good. It's subtle and mild. Mild, like that first splash of sun on an April  morning. This coffee is coffee the way it should be. Thank you, Mr. Postum, but I think we'll be happy with the money we make selling our son into slavery. Just kidding, son. That's right. How come ''you'' don't call me back? All we wanna do is buy out your coffee shop here. My company's prepared to make you a veerry generous offer.  This is a Cramsonite briefcase. All leather, it has four compartments and a keyless lock. Interested? Well, all right.  How about $500,000? Well, that's too bad. We're just gonna have to open our Harbucks right next door to you. Hey, this is a capitalist country, pal! Get used to it!  Good! Good! Now, make sure that sign is really bright and flashy now. Excuse me?! Hey, I'm not fat ''or'' smelly! Postum! My argument is simple. This country's founded on free enterprise. Harbucks is an organization that- ''An organization that prides itself on great coffee! We simply want tuh-- Oh, to hell with you!'' What?!  Damn, these people aren't buying any coffee! I'll have to try and appeal to the younger crowd.  I have a surprise for you: the new Kiddicino from Harbucks; more sugar and all the other goodies kids like with all the caffeine of a normal double latte.  Why don't you go back to the hole you crawled out from, lady?! Oh, and you don't? Your coffee tastes like three-day-old moldy diarrhea! What?! Well, it looks like Harbucks will never make it in this town.  All right, boys, that's it. Pack it up, we're movin' out of town. I know, but these folks obviously don't want us here. Oh, quit being so melodramatic, Sanchez. Jesus Christ! It's a French roast. Hehey, no hard feelings, Tweek. You know, we still need someone to run this Harbucks coffeehouse. I'm sure it will make a ''lot'' of money. Some things are more important than money.  The people of South Park count on you to give them that first cup of coffee every day. Oh, hello, son. How was your day? Well, have some coffee boys. I'll brew up another pot for later. Hoh, you'll like this coffee. It's fresh. Richard! Now, Tweek, how many times do we have to tell you? Your underpants are missing because you ''lose'' them, not because of underpants gnomes. Honestly, Richard. I don't see why you have to preach to some eight-year olds. My goodness. That's going to be a huge coffee house, honey. Liike, how do you mean?  Oh, that. He has ADD, attention deficit disorder. That's why he's so jittery all the time. I have a big problem with this. We are just using those boys for our benefit. They have no idea what they're saying. You don't just throw a child in a political commercial to sell your beliefs. I won't be a part of this anymore.  These boys are absolutely right. We've been using these poor kids to pull at your heartstrings for our cause, and it's wrong. We're as low and despicable as Rob Reiner. You keep protesting and complaining, but did any of you ever even bother to ''taste'' Harbucks coffee?  Harbucks coffee got to where it is by being the best. Don't you think you should at least try it? That's good. Who are your little friends? Great job! Boys, you have really opened our eyes. We didn't even know this was happening. Well, Mr. Garrison, it looks like we were wrong about you. You really ''are'' teaching these kids something. Aw, I am really moved. I say we follow these boys's cause. Let's join them in the fight against corporate takeovers!  Lead the way, boys! Mr. Tweek, we've only just heard. So, ''this'' is the corporate bulldozer trying to push you off the map.  Don't worry, Mr. Tweek. This committee is not going to let you be run out of business by these bastards! ''Do you hear that? You're not gonna get away with this, you whore!'' ...And we would have never even known that this was happening if not for these boys' excellent report. That's right. Yes! Mayor, these boys want that Harbucks coffee shut down right now! But they're ruining our city!  What do you say, boys? We're gonna pass a law! Well, what do you think?  Yes, it is. We'll put it on the air immediately.  Toto, ladies and gentlemen! All right. And now, before we all vote yes on Prop. 10, here to remind us why are the lovable, innocent children. That's not what you said last time. These boys did an excellent report for us this morning. They're so upset by this whole thing. Boys, we've talked it over, and we want you to take your case ''to the mayor''! Come on, boys! Let's go! Yeah! Yeah! Hooray! Hooray! Next is issue 37D, missing underpants.  Is it cold in here? Toto. Should Harbucks be allowed to open a store in South Park? That's tonight's topic. On my left, five innocent, starry-eyed boys from Middle America.  On my right, a big, fat, smelly corporate guy from New York. All right, Mr. Douchebag. Oh. Pardon me, Mr. Assface. Anyway, let's hear your side of the argument.  Come on, boys, don't be shy. What's your principal argument? Great argument! You win, boys! Take your corporate coffee and go back to New York City! How many Native Americans did you slaughter to make that coffee, huh?! It's people like you who are ruining Main Street, USA!  You should be ashamed of yourself, using cartoons to push caffeine on children! Is that all you've got, pussy? You're a pussy, pussy! Stealing underpants ''big'' business. Sure, that's what gnomes do. O-kay. Follow me.  Not much longer now. No, pussy, I'm taking you to my village.  Follow me. This is where all our work is done. Collecting underpants is just phase 1. Phase 1: collect underpants.  Hey, what's phase 2? Yeah yeah yeah, but, what about phase 2? You bet we do! Holy shit! We've killed your friend! Well, we can explain that to you easily. You know. Aw, but we just finished. But what will become of us? Phase 1: we collect underpants.  Well, phase 3 is profit. Get it?  You see,<br>Phase 1: collect underpants. Phase 2: ... Phase 3: Profit. Us gnomes are geniuses at corporations. Christ, we squished him like a bug! Yes, for a price. ''[three of them move a cart up a track]<br>Time to go to work, work all night<br>Se--'' Underpants!  Jesus Christ, look out! Yeah, Toto! Whoo, Toto! Woo! Underpants gnomes? What? What's this? Good?  Ogh. Hey, this is pretty damn good. Yeah, it doesn't have that bland, raw, sewage taste that Tweek's coffee has. As we steer our boat down  This croc has enough power in its jaws to rip my head right off. I've got to be careful. So, what I'm gonna do is sneak up on it and jam my thumb in its butthole. If I get bit out here, I'm 200 kilometers from the nearest hospital: I'd better be real careful jamming my thumb in its butthole.  Oh, boy, it's pissed off now. I'm gonna jam my thumb in its butthole now! This should really piss it off!  I've gotta be careful!  Well! That was quite an angry croc! But I managed to escape with only a few bruises and a shattered left testicle. Next week we'll look for more of these beautiful creatures, so we can learn more about them by pissing them off immensely. Thanks for watching. This grizzly bear has the strength of over ten Morgan Freemans. I'm really pissing him off right now.  Sure I can! I can hunt down anything! Wait a second.  I think he came through here recently.  Calm down, calm down. Wait! Look! No! It's a Rocky Mountain rattle snake.  Awww, yeah, that pissed it off all right!  The trail ends here. No worries.  Come back here, you!  Oh, he's a wily one!  Notice the dilated pupils of this prehistoric man. A sure sign the prey is frightened. As well as he should be, as I will now jam my thumb up his butthole.  Now I've got ''you'' pinned. ''I'' win! Now for the coup de gras. I'll just... get my... thumb up... here.  Holy bum-! AAAAAAAAAAAAA! Hooray!  CARTMAN, WILL YOU SHUT THE HELL UP AND GET SOME MORE ROPE?! No!  Yippee. Wait, what was that? I missed the question. Yippee!  Screw you!  Nay.  in our evolution. If I can unfreeze the body, and perform an autopsy, I could learn much about this creature's people and its time. Thank you, Mayor. Oh, and boys, I, I can't give you a reward for finding this creature, but if you'd like, I'll let you name him. Steve it is. Come on, Steve. We've got work to do.  Unfreezing this body will be quite delicate work. We'll have to use the most advanced methods available. This is very exciting. He could be a Neanderthal. Or an Australopithecus from the Paleolithic era.  This is incredible! Think of all we can learn from this body! All that it can teach us! Let's just hope the press doesn't get wind of this right away. Ladies and gentlemen, we still have a lot of work to do.  Yes, it's true, although at this early stage we know very little about this man or the time from which he comes. That's it, Kevin. Now we can begin the autopsy. Ugh? What's this? That's impossible!  Do an EKG on him! My God, he really ''is'' alive. The ice must have preserved him! No no, we've got to think this through.  Mayor, this man has not been conscious for almost three years. He won't understand what he sees! He'll be frightened and confused! Perhaps death is better than the shock he will take trying to adapt to our time.  Oh my God. It looks as if he's about to speak! What? You're, you're hungry? You're, you're hungry? Me friend. Friieend. Me friend. Ma-phes-to. Mah-phehs-to. Hawgh! If we could understand what he's saying, then maybe we could get some answers.  If only there was someone who could communicate with him on a level as primitive as his own, a mind like... a ''child''. Steve. You- Steeve. Steeeve. Steeeve.  Oh good, you're here. Yes, and I need you to communicate with him. See if you can understand what he's saying.  What'd he say? Very interesting. What?? Tell him, tell him he's... home. In the year 1999. He's been frozen for the last 32 months. And we found you- All right, all right, all- All right, all right, calm down. I think that's enough for today.  The same. That's right. Oh? Where are you gents from? Well, there's not a lot to see, but... Come in.  but we've made great progress now that he's in the habitat.  Yes. Kevin and I designed a habitat for Steve to live in that is completely like his own world. Everything is 1996-oriented. Yes, well, Kevin has done a lot of work in figuring out just how related to us Steve really is. He came up with this drawing: How would we do ''that''? As you can see, the ice man is listening to Ace of Base, which was a very popular group during his era, and primitive drumming soothed his people's tempers. Ah! Here we see the ice man trying to gain Internet access on the computer. The Internet was still not very big in his time, so the Web frightens and confuses him.  And now the ice man watches television.  Wait. This could be dangerous. He's fine, boys. And we're learning ''so much'' from him. He's gone! The ice man has broken out! He must have used this... door. We have to find him! He won't survive long out in the world! No, what did you say? Uh, use him for what? I have no idea! Was the ice man here? He can't function out here in our time! Is it him? Does he always do this?  Have you seen a man who looks similar to us, but with a thicker brow and an apish nose? An ice man, a man from the past. We must find him. Now, where is he?!  Where is he? Where is Steve?! We've got to stop it! He has to be around here somewhere. No! Come back! You can't get out! You'll never live!  What?!  Uuuurrr.  Mmmmm. Uugh!  Uh, ughn.  Where... where am I? Where am I? What's goin' on? Huh? Where am I? Hi. Where am I? It's 1999?? What? Thirty-two months?! Aaaa!   AAAAAAA! Whoa, oh. What?!! Rrrowrrr! Oh hi. What are ''you'' doing here? Viewing hours are 10 to 6. Wow. That's really nice of you, kid. Thanks! My name is Larry. Uh. Hey, kids, could you just open the door so I can get back to my family?  Arrrggh! Leslie. It's me, Larry.  Your husband? Think hard, Leslie. We used to be together, for over eight years? That was ''me!'' So you... remarried. Larry! Didn't anybody send out a search party? Please, Leslie, I don't know where else to go. I'm confused. ''You're'' Leslie. I'm sorry, too. I'll leave you alone.   I can't live in your time. I'm freezing myself again. Tell me about it. I've been doing this for over three and a half hours now, and only my toes are starting to ice over. What is that?  They're coming for me! Okay, boys. Thanks.  I got my ticket. I have to go to Platform B. Well, this is it. I'm going back to my time. Thanks again, boys. You boys have really shown me the true meaning of friendship. You didn't care about anything but my happiness. You put me in front of yourselves, and that's what real friendship is all about. After being frozen, I've learned that all a person has in life is family. And friends. If you lose those, you have nothing. So friends are to be treasured, more than anything in the world! Goodbye, boys. Goodbye, friends! Oh, poo! Huh?  Whah?!  I've got you pinned. I win.  Nooo!  Oohh!  Good-bye again! I'm off to Des Moines! I'm not living here! Living is having ups and downs and sharing them with friends!  Thank you, Stan and Kyle! See ya! We are from the University, of... America. Little boy, sometimes, what's right isn't as important as what's profitable. Sshhhh! What? Dr. Mephesto, where could the creature have gone? He's changing the channel. Something on the television could frighten and confuse him. And they've done it! The Atlanta Falcons are going to the Super Bowl! Husband? You're not my husband.  Oh. It's my former husband, who I had forgotten all about. Yes, Lorry. Uh, larry. Larry-y, you disap-peared. I waited for you to come home for over three days! I. I remember how cold and lonely the nights got. By the fourth day I knew: I had to move on. We did, Larry. We looked all afternoon. But we found nothing, no trace. Leslie, I'm with Buck now.  Right. I'm with Buck now. We have children together.  Calvin is eight, and little Buck is 13. I just can't up and leave them. I'm sorry.  Who is it, lover? Ooooo.   Home. Hey, who are you? Yes, hello. I see you.  Whoa! Aah, the train's not stopping.  AAAAAAAA!  Wow, that is the God-damnedest thing I've ever seen.
