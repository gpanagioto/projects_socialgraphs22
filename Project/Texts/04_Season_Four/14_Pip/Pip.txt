 Wa-a-ah!  I'm an apprentice blacksmith.  Well, it's not for me to judge you, sir. We are all the same.  Waaah!  Lovely day, isn't it? Where? That's a lot of  money-loney. ...I've come to answer the want ad.  What?? Eho. After you, miss. I've come to answer the want ad, ma'am. Oh, no, no! You you sort of look upon one when you have not seen the sun for over 20 years quite a lot these... days.  Righty-o. What are we going to play?  Well, uh... I think she's very pretty. I think she's rather insulting.  Don't you wanna play anymore? Oho. Well, yes, miss. Oh, um, not so much as before.  Ow!  Oh, dear. Who is that? Oh I... rather thought I was.  Hoh, lovely. Joe, do you know anything about girls?  But, do you know anything about them? About how they work. Do you think that a girl who is rich and educated would ever want to be with a blacksmith? I'm Pip, sir. Oho. But it ''must'' be Ms. Havisham! Yes sir. Good-bye, sir. None, sir. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.  Mr. Pocket? Thank you kindly. You do look rather familiar My, how lovely. Oh it's... quite alright.  Lord bless me! Why, you're the pale young man I saw at Ms. Havisham's house! Perhaps, but perhaps not. Ms. Havisham is very generous indeed. Well, what do you mean? Pocket, may I ask you a favor? I am desperately trying to become a gentleman! For the love of a certain girl. So, will you please tell me if I do something wrong at the table?   Sorry! Sorry! Oh. Excuse me. At half nine, the time when she stopped all the clocks in the house. Terribly sorry, Pocket.   Thanks to you. Oh, my! She is even prettier than before.   I don't know. I mean, I think about her every day. Righto. Yes, but... where will I find her? Thank you, Ms. Havisham! For everything!  I'm the happiest boy in the land! Hello, Estella. Yes. I've become a gentleman. May I?  Well, I was sent to be schooled in London. Oh. I see Joe once in a while. But I don't have much in common with him anymore, now that I'm a gentleman and all.  It is wonderful to see you again, Estella. Because I believe I'm in love with you.  I think you do. I see past that, Estella. I see a little girl who wants to be warm and kind. Who...? Who is that? I see, and you... fancy this Steve fellow?  Boyfriend?? I don't understand! I did everything right! I stopped being a poor commoner! I even blew off my lovin' Joe! Ms. Havisham! You have to talk to Estella! She's going out with a-  Ms. Havisham! But um... But I don't understand.  You sent me away to become a gentleman so that ''I'' could be with Estella.  ...Well, I suppose that if you set out to break my heart, you did a very good job of it. Because it certainly does hurt. It's... a-as if... squeezing it very tightly. But why do you make your daughter hurt people?  Joe?  Oh, why would she have wasted all that time sending me to school and making me into a gentleman? Why, you're the escaped convict I helped a long time ago. You? But why? Oh, dear. All this time I thought it was Ms. Havisham. She totally let me believe it.  Well, I've certainly learned a lot. That being a gentleman doesn't mean learning to dance, or proper table manners. It means being a gentle man. Gentle to ''everyone.'' And now I suppose there's only one thing left to do. If Ms. Havisham is determined to do this to others, let's go KICK HER ARSE! Not so fast, you ugly ancient bitch. You won't get away with this!  Pocket! Get over there, and do whatever it takes to keep those blokes from crying!  Come, Estella! You can't want to be part of this.  Estella! Listen to me! You are a wonderful girl, with a kind heart. But you do! And I shall prove it to you once and for all!  Look at this adorable little bunny. You see that? A heartless person wouldn't care at all about this bunny. They'd just as soon break its neck.  ...Right. Nine. Nine baby bunnies. A person with a heart could never kill ''nine'' baby bunnies. So you ''do'' have too big a heart to-  Ten baby bunnies! Twenty-six baby bunnies What? There! You see?! You ''do'' have a heart!  You're released from her now, Estella! Now we can begin our life together!
