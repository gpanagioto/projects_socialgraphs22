Yeah, it was huge. Yeah, what's there to hate about rainbows? Cartman, what the hell are you talking about? What were you talking about? That's impossible, Cartman doesn't know a rain-forest from a Pop-Tart. Dude, dolphins are like the second smartest animal on the planet. Yeah, cause Cartman cheated and won the environmental essay contest. Yeah, that'd be cool.  We don't believe for a minute that you won that contest fairly, fat boy. Dude, dolphins are intelligent and friendly. Dolphins are way smarter than you! Dolphins don't live in igloos, that's Eskimos! Tell me what you wrote about! Yeah, right! You'll go and sit in front of the TV and eat Cheesy Poofs, ass-master! What? You've got to weight 90 pounds. What's that stuff? Super fat-ass? Take that you stupid Indian! Shut up Cartman! Wendy, you got to prioritize. What's more important? Being on TV or some stupid assassination? Wendy, look! Mr. Garrison, stop! Man, did she really throw her voice with two dummies at once? What about, not holding anything against the person who wins? Come on Wendy, Kyle's mom will make us tuna fish sandwiches. We hope you can come back to school real soon Mr. Garrison.
