Thank you, Mr. Mackey, students of South Park Elementary.. I'm here to educate you about the single biggest threat to our planet. You see, there is something out there which threatens our very existence and may be the end of the human race as we know it. I'm talking of course about...  It is a creature which roams the earth alone. It is half man, half bear, and half pig. Some people say that ManBearPig isn't real. Well, I'm here to tell you know, ManBearPig is very real, and he most certainly exists. I'm serial. ManBearPig doesn't care who you are or what you've done. ManBearPig simply wants to get you! I'm super-serial.  But have no fear, because ''I'' am here to save you! And someday, when the world is rid of ManBearPig, everyone will say "Thank you, Al Gore. You're super awesome." The end. Thank you, class. Excelsior!  I'm spreading ManBearPig awareness. Here, each of you kids take a pamphlet and a bumper sticker.  I hope now you boys see that this is totally serial. The next time, it could be the "real" ManBearPig. Can I just get you to sign the awareness sheet? Just your name and phone number and where you first heard about ManBearPig?  Hello. Be safe.  Hello, this is Al Gore. I was the vice president. Can you and your friends make it to an emergency ManBearPig meeting tomorrow morning? I have some evidence he could be in this area.  Oh. I get it. You don't believe me either. Yes it is. Nobody believes me!  No you don't. Are you serial?  Hi kids! Come on in!  Okay, let's get this meeting started. What do you kids think we should do to stop ManBearPig?  What does your dad look like?? Does he have large hooves where his feet should be?? Damn. For a minute there, I thought we found him.  Oh Jesus on ice skates, we've gotta get down there right away. I can get you all excused from school.  Look! You boys have a chance to help me find and kill ManBearPig once and for all! I'm totally serial! Have you noticed high deposits of sulfur or a salmon-like odor coming from the caves lately? All right, kids, I need you to keep an eye out for ManBearPig droppings. Similar to pig droppings, but more manbearlike. Groan! Groan!  Not yet.  Kids! Kids, over here! Look. I bet this is where he's hiding.   No! Leave them alone, you Goddamned ManBearPig! Damn you ManBearPig! They're just children!  Excuse me, Ex''cuse'' me. This cave-in was no accident, and it isn't going to stop unless we move fast! I am super... duper... serial! I'm afraid you have a much bigger problem than a cave-in. No, stupid! It's ManBearPig!  Why won't anybody listen to me?! ManBearPig is in there and we have to kill him while we all have the chance. I'm serial! I told you we need to fill the cave with hot molten lead, 'cause it's the only way to make sure ManBearPig never comes out! And I'm sane and I'm totally serial, but everyone just keeps digging! They're already dead! Didn't you listen to me?? They got attacked by a ManBearPig and ManBearPig leaves nobody alive! I'm super serial! Nobody will listen to me but I'm serial!  This is the end of you, ManBearPig.  Excelsior!  I did it. I killed ManBearPig. I've saved the earth from certain destruction. Everyone is super-stoked on me, even if they don't know it. We are gathered here to say goodbye to four kids whom we all tried to help, but, in the end, could not. But where there is loss, there is hope. For ManBearPig is no more. I have beaten ManBearPig, and we will never forget the names of the brave young kids who lost their lives. Kid 1, Kid 2, Kid 3, and of course, Kid 4.  And how Kid 2 was always there when I needed him.  Kids! I saved you!
