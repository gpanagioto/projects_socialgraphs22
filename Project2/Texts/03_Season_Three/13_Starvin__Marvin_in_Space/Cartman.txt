Hey! That was Kyle that went #2 in the urinal! Oh, dude, this is not cool! No. Dude, I've seen this on TV. They shine that light in your face, and then they try to get you to tell them stuff by squeezing your balls really hard. Dude, I've seen it! They grab your balls with their leather-gloved hands and they squeeze 'em as hard as they can until they pop like little grapes!  Whoa, cool. Totally! Heeyy, that's Starvin' Marvin. Oh. We don't know him. Kyle's makin' mudpies; you guys want one?   K-kill me. No wait. I'll tell you.  He's, he's a little starving Ethiopian kid. We adopted him. Sally. Sally Struthers. The lady on TV. She knows everything. Sally Struthers. Dude, I couldn't take anymore of that balloon. Another couple hours of that, and I would've been totally pissed off. Well, I can't find anything- wait. What's this?  Oh, my God, ''this'' guy again.  Oh! Aww!  Well nice job, Marvin! I hope you got about a thousand dollars to pay for my house! Yeah, but where's that crappy song coming from? Could you turn that off?  No way, not Utah. Utah's nothin' but missionaries. Well, he hasn't been here yet. Where's this?  Ey! I'm the leader of Earth! Well, you can call leader 'til your ass bleeds, but that doesn't make it true!  No, never. It's perfect. Wah-ey. Come on you guys, wait! Forget him! He's done for!  No, no, he's done for. Come on!  U-u-huh. I don't remember. Hey, I was under duress! Maybe it waaas this one.  Holy shit! It's Sally Struthers! Wait. Ms. Struthers? Ms. Struthers! Ms. Struthers, please. Just listen to me for one second. You started the Feed the Children Foundation for wonderful reasons: to help starving, helpless people who live in a rotten part of the world. Well, it's for those reasons we wanna help our friend Marvin now.  Ms. Struthers. You helped so many people, and you've taught us that helping people is what life is all about. All we wanna do is... be like you.  She bought it. Wait. I remember. It was the ''red'' button!  Alright, Yeah, and maybe Jesse Jackson will be President, heh. What? We're not gonna come visit him. T'heh, whatever.
