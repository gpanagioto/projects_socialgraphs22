Say Terrance, isn't it wonderful having a holiday here at the Lazy "J" Ranch? Oh, look who's coming! Isn't that Mohammad, the holy prophet of the Muslim religion?  You censored out the image of Mohammad in our television special!! We demand you rerun ''Mystery at the Lazy "J" Ranch'' with Mohammad uncensored!
