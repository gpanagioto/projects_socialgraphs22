Mr. Garrison, we've been watching ''Barnaby Jones'' repeats for eight days now. It's hard to keep paying attention. To where? Yeah, all the constellations look alike. You couldn't get both arms behind your back, fatass! I thought it was planetarium. Hey, who are you?  Whoopie. Oh, man, I don't feel so good. Me too. It was sweet. Did what? My head still feels funny. Like you really need it, hippo-ass! Whoa, dude! Who the hell are you?! Mr. Garrison, since haiku sucks so much ass, could we go to the planetarium again? I dunno. I just have this sudden urge to go back. What do you mean? Sshh! Why? Oh, yeah. Here's the control panel that operates all the stars. You see? Nothing, dude. Just a bunch of stars. What does that do? Kenny! What's it doing? We're bastards! We've gotta go tell somebody, quick! But it's true, dude! Don't do it, Officer Barbrady! He's not highly intelligent.  Cartman! You saved us! He got a full dose of the stars. Can you imagine it, Stan. A mind, emptied by that... thing.
