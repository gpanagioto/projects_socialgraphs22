Oh, hello Coach. Well, he isn't worse, but, he isn't getting better. It's almost as if... his cancer were tied. He seems to have put all his hope into you winning that game. And with a tie, he's in a kind of... cancer limbo. Look! He's coming around again.  Just be aware of this, Coach. If you lose the Big Game, that little boy is going to die faster than Steve Irwin in a tank full of stingrays.
