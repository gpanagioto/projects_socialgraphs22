Daredevil is the alias of '''Matthew Michael "Matt" Murdock''', a blind lawyer. His [[origin story|origins]] stem from a childhood car accident that gave him special abilities. While growing up in the historically gritty or crime-ridden [[working class]] [[Irish-American]] neighborhood of [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] in [[New York City]], Matt Murdock is blinded by a [[Radioactive contamination|radioactive]] substance that falls from an out-of-control truck after he pushes a man out of the path of the oncoming vehicle. While he can no longer see, his exposure to the radioactive material heightens his remaining senses beyond normal human ability, and gives him a "radar sense." His father, a boxer named [[Jack Murdock (character)|Jack Murdock]], is a single man raising his now blind son, who despite his rough upbringing, unconditionally loves his son and tries to teach him to form a better life for himself. Jack is later killed by gangsters after refusing to [[Match fixing|throw a fight]], leaving Matt an orphan. In order to protect himself, Matt began training to hone his physical abilities and superhuman senses under the tutelage of a mysterious blind stranger named [[Stick (comics)|Stick]], eventually becoming a highly skilled and expert martial artist.

Some years later, after graduating from law school with high grades, Matt seeks out the criminal element in Hell's Kitchen and starts his crime-fighting activities. Matt targets the local gangsters who murdered his father and succeeds in bringing them to justice. Eventually, donning a costumed attire modeled after a devil, Matt took up a dual life of fighting against the criminal underworld in New York City as the masked vigilante Daredevil, which put him in conflict with many super-villains, including his arch-enemies [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] and the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]].<ref name="debut">{{Cite comic | Writer=[[Stan Lee|Lee, Stan]] | Penciller=[[Bill Everett|Everett, Bill]] | Inker=[[Steve Ditko|Ditko, Steve]] | Story=The Origin of Daredevil | Title=Daredevil | Issue=1 | date=April 1964 | Publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> He also becomes a skilled and respected lawyer after graduating from Columbia Law School with his best friend and roommate, [[Foggy Nelson|Franklin "Foggy" Nelson]], with whom he becomes law partners, forming the law firm Nelson & Murdock. After pretending to have a sighted [[Twin#Monozygotic (identical) twins|identical twin]] brother named '''Mike Murdock''', who Matt would claim was Daredevil whenever his identity was made public knowledge, and occasionally impersonate, Mike is brought into existence following an encounter with a reality-warping [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], before cementing his existence alongside Matt in [[Retroactive continuity|history]] with a magic spell.

Daredevil has since appeared in various forms of media, including several [[animated series]], [[video games]] and [[Merchandising|merchandise]]. The character was first portrayed in live action by [[Rex Smith (entertainer)|Rex Smith]] in the 1989 [[television film]] ''[[The Trial of the Incredible Hulk]]'', and then by [[Ben Affleck]] in the 2003 film ''[[Daredevil (film)|Daredevil]]''.

The character debuted in [[Marvel Comics]]' ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' #1 ([[cover date]] April 1964),<ref name=gcd-dd1>{{gcdb series|id= 1636|title= Daredevil ''(Marvel, 1964 series)''}}</ref> created by writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Bill Everett]],<ref>{{cite book|last1 = DeFalco|first1 = Tom|author-link = Tom DeFalco|last2 = Gilbert|first2 = Laura|chapter= 1960s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2008|location= London, United Kingdom|page = 100|isbn =978-0756641238|quote= Stan Lee chose the name Daredevil because it evoked swashbucklers and circus daredevils, and he assigned Bill Everett, the creator of the Sub-Mariner to design and draw ''Daredevil'' #1.}}</ref> with character design input from [[Jack Kirby]], who devised Daredevil's billy club.<ref name="thejackfaq4"/> Writer and [[comics historian]] [[Mark Evanier]] has suggested without confirmation that Kirby also designed the basic image of Daredevil's initial costume, though Everett modified it.<ref name="thejackfaq4"/> That original costume design was a combination of black, yellow, and red, reminiscent of acrobat tights.<ref name="debut"/>

The first issue covered both the character's origins and his desire for justice on the man who had killed his father, boxer [[Jack Murdock (comics)|"Battling Jack" Murdock]], who raised young Matthew Murdock in the [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] neighborhood of [[Manhattan]], New York City. Jack instills in Matt the importance of education and nonviolence with the aim of seeing his son become a better man than himself. In the course of saving a blind man from the path of an oncoming truck, Matt is blinded by a radioactive substance that falls from the vehicle. The radioactive exposure heightens his remaining senses beyond normal human limits, and giving him a kind of "radar" sense, enabling him to detect the shape and location of objects around him. In order to support his son, Jack Murdock returns to boxing under the Fixer, a known gangster, and the only man willing to contract the aging boxer. When he refuses to throw a fight because his son is in the audience, he is killed by one of the Fixer's men. Having promised his father not to use violence to deal with his problems, Matt gets around that promise by adopting a new identity who can use physical force. Adorned in a yellow and black costume made from his father's boxing robes and using his superhuman abilities, Matt confronts the killers as the superhero Daredevil, unintentionally causing the Fixer to have a fatal heart attack.<ref name="debut"/>

[[Wally Wood]] introduced Daredevil's modern red costume in issue #7,<ref name="writers">{{cite web |url=http://www.manwithoutfear.com/daredevil-writers.shtml |title=Daredevil: The Man Without Fear – Writers |first=Kuljit |last=Mithra |date=1996–2013 |publisher=ManWithoutFear.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130321191654/http://www.manwithoutfear.com/daredevil-writers.shtml |archive-date=March 21, 2013 |url-status=live |access-date=May 2, 2009 |df=mdy }}</ref><ref>DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 107</ref> which depicts Daredevil's battle against the far more powerful [[Sub-Mariner]], and has become one of the most iconic stories of the series.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Thomas|first= Roy|date= August 2011|title= Stan Lee's Amazing Marvel Interview!|journal= [[Alter Ego (magazine)|Alter Ego]]|issue= 104| pages= 10, 12|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|location= Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1= Lee|first1= Stan|chapter= In Mortal Combat with Sub-Mariner|title= The Very Best of Marvel Comics|publisher= Marvel Comics|date= 1991|page= 136|isbn= 0-87135-809-3}}</ref>

Daredevil would embark on a series of adventures involving such villains as the [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]], [[Stilt-Man]], the [[Gladiator (Melvin Potter)|Gladiator]], and the [[Enforcers (comics)|Enforcers]].

The series' 31-issue run by writer-editor Stan Lee and penciler [[Gene Colan]] (beginning with issue #20) includes ''Daredevil'' #47, in which Murdock defends a blind [[Vietnam veteran]] against a [[frameup]]; Lee has cited it as one of the favorite stories of his career.<ref>{{cite book|last = McLaughlin|first = Jeff|title = Stan Lee: Conversations|publisher = [[University Press of Mississippi]]|year = 2007|location= Jackson, Mississippi|page = 185|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=zLmB3GprtboC&q=Stan+Lee+most+proud+of&pg=PA185|isbn = 978-1578069859|quote= There was a ''Daredevil'' story about a blind guy that I loved [issue #47].}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1= Lee|first1= Stan|chapter= Brother, Take My Hand!|title=The Very Best of Marvel Comics|date=1991|publisher=Marvel Comics|page=157|isbn= 0-87135-809-3}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=January 2017}}

Matt discloses his secret identity to his girlfriend [[Karen Page]] in issue #57.<ref>DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 138</ref>  However, the revelation proves too much for her, and she is depicted as breaking off the relationship.<ref name="daredevilvol1#57">{{Cite comic | Writer= Lee, Stan| Penciller= Colan, Gene| Inker=[[Syd Shores|Shores, Syd]] | Story=In the Midst of Life...! | Title=Daredevil | Issue=57 | date=October 1969 | Publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref> This was the first of several long-term breakups between Matt and Karen, who would nevertheless prove the most enduring of his love interests.

===1970s===
[[Gerry Conway]] took over as writer with issue #72, and turned the series in a pulp science fiction direction: a lengthy story arc centered on a robot from thousands of years in the future trying to change history. Even long-standing arch-villain the Owl was outfitted with futuristic weaponry and vehicles. Conway also moved Daredevil to [[San Francisco]] beginning with ''Daredevil'' #86, and simultaneously brought on the [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]] as a co-star for the series.<ref>Sanderson "1970s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 155: In May [1972], writer Gerry Conway transported Daredevil and his crime-fighting partner, the Black Widow, into a mansion in San Francisco.</ref> The Black Widow served as Daredevil's crime-fighting ally as well as his love interest from issue #81–124 (Nov. 1971–Aug. 1975), of which #93-108 were titled ''Daredevil and the Black Widow''.

[[Jann Wenner]], the co-founder and publisher of the ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' music magazine appeared in ''Daredevil'' #100 (June 1973) by Gerber and Colan.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Boyd|first= Jerry|title= The House of Ideas' Herculean 100th Issues!!

Miller continued the title in a similar vein to McKenzie. Resuming the drastic metamorphosis the previous writer had begun, Miller took the step of essentially ignoring all of Daredevil's continuity prior to his run on the series; on the occasions where older villains and supporting cast were used, their characterizations and history with Daredevil were reworked or overwritten. Most prominently, dedicated and loving father Jack Murdock was reimagined as a drunkard who [[physical abuse|physically abused]] his son Matt, entirely revising Daredevil's reasons for becoming a lawyer.<ref name="daredevilvol1#191">{{Cite comic | Writer=Miller, Frank | Penciller=Miller, Frank| Inker=[[Terry Austin (comics)|Austin, Terry]] | Story= Roulette | Title=Daredevil | Issue=191 | date=May 1980 | Publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref> [[Spider-Man]] villain [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]] was introduced as Daredevil's new primary nemesis, displacing most of his large rogues gallery. Daredevil himself was gradually developed into something of an [[antihero]]. In issue #181 (April 1982), he attempts to murder Bullseye by throwing him off a tall building; when the villain survives as a [[quadriplegic]], he breaks into his hospital room and tries to scare him to death by playing a two-man variation on [[Russian roulette]] with a secretly unloaded gun.<ref name="daredevilvol1#191"/>

After #191 Miller left the series. O'Neil switched from editor to writer.<ref name="O'NeilInt"/> He continued McKenzie and Miller's noir take on the series, but backed away from the antihero depiction of the character by having him not only spare Bullseye's life but express guilt over his two previous attempts to kill him. Miller returned as the title's regular writer, co-writing #226 with O'Neil. Miller and artist [[David Mazzucchelli]] crafted the acclaimed "[[Born Again (comics)|Born Again]]" storyline in #227–233.<ref>DeFalco "1980s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 226: "'Born Again' was a seven-issue story arc that appeared in ''Daredevil'' from issue #227 to #233 (Feb.&nbsp;– Aug. 1986)."</ref> In the ''Born Again'' storyline, Karen Page returns as a heroin-addicted porn star, and sells Daredevil's secret identity for drug money. The Kingpin acquires the information and, in an act of revenge, orchestrates a frameup that costs Murdock his attorney's license. Miller ended the arc on a positive note, with Murdock reuniting with both Karen Page and [[Maggie Murdock|Maggie]], the mother he thought dead, now a nun.

[[Ann Nocenti]] later became the series's longest-running regular writer, with a four-and-a-quarter-year run from #238–291 (Jan. 1987&nbsp;– April 1991).

The team returned Murdock to law by co-founding with Page a nonprofit drug and legal clinic, while Nocenti crafted stories confronting [[feminism]], [[drug abuse]], [[nuclear proliferation]], and [[animal rights]]-inspired terrorism. She introduced the antagonist [[Typhoid Mary (character)|Typhoid Mary]],<ref>DeFalco "1980s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 237: "Mary was first introduced in ''Daredevil'' #254 by [writer] Ann Nocenti and artist John Romita Jr."</ref> and in issues #262–265 used [[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|the Inferno event]] as a backdrop for the collapse of Daredevil's life: the clinic is destroyed, Page goes missing after learning that Matt has had an affair with Mary Walker, and Walker reveals herself as the alter ego of Typhoid Mary. Murdock subsequently becomes a [[drifter (person)|drifter]] in [[upstate New York]], an especially controversial move in Nocenti's run, as it marked the first time the character had been taken outside of an urban environment. She ended her run with a positive turn in Murdock's fortunes: he returns to Hell's Kitchen, regains his sense of self, reconciles with Foggy Nelson, and resolves to seek out Karen Page.

===1990s===
New writer [[D. G. Chichester]] continued from where Nocenti left off, with Murdock resuming his friendship with [[Foggy Nelson]], struggling to re-win the heart of Karen Page, appealing the revocation of his attorney's license, and bonding more deeply than ever with Hell's Kitchen. Chichester's focus on Daredevil's relationship with New York City went so far as to have two issues devoted entirely to Daredevil defending New Yorkers from ordinary criminals and even simple accidents. The critically acclaimed "Last Rites" arc from #297–300 saw Daredevil regaining his attorney's license and finally bringing the Kingpin to justice.<ref>Manning, Matthew K. "1990s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 258: "Culminating in the anniversary 300th issue, Daredevil would finally gain the upper hand against longtime foe Wilson Fisk (the Kingpin) in this moody tale by writer D. G. Chichester and penciller Lee Weeks."</ref>

[[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] returned to the character and his origins with the 1993 five-issue ''[[Daredevil: The Man Without Fear]]'' miniseries.<ref>Manning "1990s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 264: "Comic legends Frank Miller and John Romita Jr. united to tell a new version of Daredevil's origin in this carefully crafted five-issue miniseries."</ref> With artist [[John Romita Jr.]], Miller expanded his [[retcon]] of the life and death of Murdock's father, "Battling Jack" Murdock, and Murdock's first encounters with the Kingpin and Foggy Nelson.<ref name="man without fear">{{Cite book |first= Frank|last= Miller|author-link= Frank Miller (comics)|author2=Romita Jr., John |author-link2= John Romita Jr.| title= Daredevil: The Man Without Fear|publisher= Marvel Comics|page= 160|year= 1994|isbn= 978-0752208978}}</ref> The role of [[Stick (comics)|Stick]] in the genesis of Daredevil was expanded, as was Murdock's doomed love affair with Elektra.

The creative team of Chichester and penciler [[Scott McDaniel]] changed the ''status quo'' with their "Fall From Grace" storyline in issues #319–325 (Aug. 1993&nbsp;– Feb. 1994).<ref>Manning "1990s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 263</ref> [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]], who was resurrected in #190 but had not been seen since, finally returned. An injured Daredevil creates a more protective costume from biomimetic materials: red and gray with white armor on the shoulders and knee pads. Revamped billy clubs could attach to form [[nunchucks]] or a [[bo staff]]. His secret identity becomes public knowledge, leading to him fake his own death and assuming the new identity of "Jack Batlin". This new identity and costume last for several story arcs, while Murdock finds a way to convince the world that he is not, in fact, secretly Daredevil (courtesy of a double). A short stint by [[J. M. DeMatteis]] returned Daredevil to his traditional red costume and Matt Murdock's identity.

Under writers [[Karl Kesel]] and later [[Joe Kelly (comics)|Joe Kelly]], the title gained a lighter tone, with Daredevil returning to the lighthearted, wisecracking hero depicted by earlier writers. Matt and Foggy (who now knows of Matt's dual identities) join a law firm run by Foggy's mother, Rosalind Sharpe.

In 1998, ''Daredevil''{{'}}s numbering was rebooted, with the title "canceled" with issue #380 and revived a month later as part of the [[Marvel Knights]] imprint.<ref>{{gcdb series|id= 6026|title= Daredevil ''vol. 2''}}</ref> [[Joe Quesada]] drew the new series, written by filmmaker [[Kevin Smith]].<ref>Manning "1990s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 290: "It was a dream come true for many comic fans. Kevin Smith, the writer/director of such cult films as ''Clerks'', ''Mallrats'', and ''Chasing Amy''...had been hired by Marvel to write ''Daredevil'', a character whose title many thought could use a major facelift."</ref> Its first story arc, "[[Guardian Devil]]", depicts Daredevil struggling to protect a child whom he is told could either be the [[Messiah]] or the [[Anti-Christ]]. Murdock experiences a crisis of faith exacerbated by the discovery that Karen Page has AIDS (later revealed to be a hoax) and her subsequent death at [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]]'s hands.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Smith, Kevin|penciller= Quesada, Joe|inker= Palmiotti, Jimmy|story= Guardian Devil Part 8: The Devil's Deliverance|title= Daredevil|volume= 2|issue= 8|date= June 1999}}</ref> When he discovers that the true party responsible for the scheme is [[Mysterio]], who is currently dying of cancer, he leaves Mysterio to commit suicide, deciding to use the money Karen left him in her will to re-open Nelson & Murdock.{{issue|date=September 2016}}

Smith was succeeded by writer-artist [[David W. Mack|David Mack]], who contributed the seven-issue "Parts of a Hole" (vol. 2, #9–15). The arc introduced Maya Lopez, also known as [[Echo (Marvel Comics)|Echo]], a [[deaf]] martial artist.

===2000s===
David Mack brought colleague [[Brian Michael Bendis]] to Marvel to co-write the following arc, "Wake Up" in vol. 2, #16–19 (May 2001&nbsp;– August 2001),<ref>Manning "2000s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 305: "Writer Brian Michael Bendis began his impressive run on the ''Daredevil'' title with a small character-driven four-part story, teaming with his old friend David Mack."</ref> which follows reporter [[Ben Urich]] as he investigates the aftereffects of a fight between Daredevil and the new [[Leap-Frog (comics)|Leap-Frog]].

The 2001 ''Daredevil: Yellow'' miniseries presented another take on Daredevil's origins using letters written to Karen Page after her death. The series depicts the early rivalry between Matt Murdock and Foggy Nelson for Page's affection, and incorporates many events depicted in the earliest issues of ''Daredevil''. The supervillains the Owl and the [[Purple Man]] appear as [[antagonist]]s. In this story, Daredevil credits Page with coining the phrase "The Man Without Fear", and she suggests to Daredevil he wear all maroon instead of dark red and yellow.

Issue #26 (December&nbsp;2001) brought back [[Brian Michael Bendis]]. Developments in this run included the introduction of romantic interest and future wife [[Milla Donovan]], the outing once again of Murdock's secret identity, the reemergence of the Kingpin, and Daredevil's surrender to the FBI.

The impact of his exposure as Daredevil continued to be used as a plot point by both Bendis and writer [[Ed Brubaker]] and artist [[Michael Lark]], who became the new creative team with ''Daredevil'' vol. 2, #82 (Feb. 2006).<ref>Manning "2000s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 331: "Writer Ed Brubaker and artist Michael Lark had quite a challenge ahead of them when they took over the reins of ''Daredevil'' from the popular team of writer Brian Michael Bendis and artist Alex Maleev."</ref>

A new volume began as part of the [[All-New, All-Different Marvel]] branding, written by [[Charles Soule]] with art by [[Ron Garney]] with the first two issues released in December 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/secret-wars-ends-a-force-totally-awesome-hulk-more-debut-in-marvels-december-2015-solicitations|title= ''Secret Wars'' Ends, ''A-Force,'' ''Totally Awesome Hulk'' & More Debut in Marvel's December 2015 Solicitations|date= September 15, 2015|publisher=Comic Book Resources|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20151125002053/http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/secret-wars-ends-a-force-totally-awesome-hulk-more-debut-in-marvels-december-2015-solicitations|archive-date= November 25, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> In this series, Matt returns to New York, where he now works as an Assistant District Attorney.

Following the release of Issue 28, much like with other Marvel series as part of the ''[[Marvel Legacy]]'' event, the ''Daredevil'' series renumbered, as if it had never been relaunched, with #595 which was released on November 8, 2017, where Daredevil's longtime nemesis the Kingpin became the Mayor of New York City and begins a campaign to make costumed vigilantes officially criminals.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.marvel.com/comics/78145/daredevil-storming-city-hall/|title=Daredevil: Storming City Hall|website=News - Marvel.com|access-date=April 8, 2018}}</ref> Although Murdock's attempt to set up a sting operation results in his allies being arrested when the Kingpin turns this trap against him, Fisk's legal manipulations work against him when he is attacked by the Hand, leaving Fisk in a coma and Murdock legally mayor of New York from his position as deputy mayor due to a loophole added by a prior administration that had not been amended,<ref>''Daredevil'' #600</ref> allowing Matt to take control of the city and release his fellow heroes to help him stop the Hand.<ref>''Daredevil'' #601</ref>

Charles Soule released his final Daredevil storyline "Death of Daredevil" during the October and November 2018 releases, in a 4-part bimonthly release which ended the series.<ref>[https://www.newsarama.com/41944-death-of-daredevil-starts-this-october.html DEATH OF DAREDEVIL Starts This October] -Newsarama</ref> Afterwards the series went on hiatus for two months and resumed distribution in February 2019, with a brand-new volume written by [[Chip Zdarsky]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newsarama.com/42800-marvel-comics-february-2019-solicitations.html|title=Marvel Comics FEBRUARY 2019 Solicitations|publisher=Newsarama}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newsarama.com/42746-daredevil-1-relaunch-coming-in-february-wait-isn-t-he-about-to-die.html|title=DAREDEVIL #1 Relaunch Coming in FEBRUARY (Wait, Isn't He About to Die?)|publisher=Newsarama}}</ref> The primary artist on the series is Marco Checchetto. This new volume follows Daredevil's return to crime-fighting as he accidentally kills a robber during an arrest, leading him to doubt his status as a hero and to a confrontation with Spider-Man. Murdock later abandons his Daredevil persona and focuses on his job as a parole officer, feeling that Daredevil does not bring justice and only harms the Hell's Kitchen community. His mantle is taken up by several vigilantes trying to replace Daredevil, eventually leading Murdock to don a black variation of Daredevil's outfit and fight against the mob, which has taken over Hell's Kitchen, usurping Wilson Fisk's control over the district.

===2020s===
After he helps save Hell's Kitchen, Daredevil, still in his mask, gives himself up to police custody, stating that he wants to stand trial for his crimes but will only do so on the condition his identity is never revealed. He voluntarily confesses to the killing and is sentenced to a prison term. While Matt serves his time, Elektra takes up the Daredevil costume and protects Hell's Kitchen at his behest. In the prison, Murdock grapples with the idea that Daredevil and Matt Murdock work together to put people in prison, which he comes to see as ruining people's lives without reforming them or setting them on the right path.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.marvel.com/articles/comics/everything-that-s-happened-in-daredevil-so-far|title=Everything That's Happened in 'Daredevil' So Far |first=Blair |last=Marnell |date= June 26, 2020 |publisher=Marvel.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/daredevil-going-to-prison-marvel-comics/|title=Daredevil is Going To Prison in Marvel Comics |first=Mike|last=Cuenca|date= September 18, 2020 |publisher=Screenrant}}</ref>

Although the character is blind, his remaining four senses function with superhuman accuracy and sensitivity, giving him abilities far beyond the limits of a sighted person. Few characters know that the hero cannot see. Daredevil developed a [[Radar]]-Sense,<ref name="historyradar">{{cite web|url=http://www.theothermurdockpapers.com/2009/03/history-of-radar-sense-4-frank-miller.html |title=A History of the Radar Sense #4 – Frank Miller, Part 1 |date=March 21, 2009 |work=The Other Murdock Papers |access-date=April 29, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090629002733/http://www.theothermurdockpapers.com/2009/03/history-of-radar-sense-4-frank-miller.html |archive-date=June 29, 2009 |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}</ref> as well as [[Human echolocation|echolocation]]. Writer/co-creator [[Stan Lee]] said that he was worried that blind people would be offended at how far he exaggerated the way a blind person's remaining senses are enhanced, but that his fears were assuaged by letters from organizations such as The Lighthouse for the Blind which said that blind people greatly enjoyed having Daredevil comics read to them.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Thomas|first= Roy|date= August 2011|location= Raleigh, North Carolina|title= Stan Lee's Amazing Marvel Interview!|journal= [[Alter Ego (magazine)|Alter Ego]]|issue= 104|page= 10|publisher= TwoMorrows Publishing|quote= The one thing that worried me about Daredevil – I wondered if blind people would be offended, because we were exaggerating so much what a blind person can do, and they might have felt that we're making it ridiculous. But I was so pleased – after the books were published, we started getting letters from charities for blind people, like the Lighthouse for the Blind in New York. Letters saying, 'We've been reading these stories to the people here and they love them, and they're so pleased you have a super-hero who is sightless.' And, oh boy, that made me feel great!}}</ref>

The [[Beyonder]] once restored Daredevil's eyesight, but, suspecting a trick on the Beyonder's part, Daredevil immediately insisted that his blindness be restored. Beyonder agreed.<ref>''Daredevil'' #223 (October 1985)</ref>

When [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] expanded most of Daredevil's abilities, he attempted to make them "extraordinary enough to be exciting, but not on par with [[Superman]]", noting Superman's distinctly unbelievable powers. When Miller joined the title in 1979, the first thing he did to the character was "revamp" his radar sense and made it less distinct and more believable; he wanted Daredevil to have the "proximity" sense that some martial artists claim to have. Due to the character's sensitive sense of touch, Daredevil can read by passing his fingers over the letters on a page<ref name="historyradar"/> though laminated pages prevent him from reading the ink.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Andy Diggle|Diggle, Andy]]|penciller=Gianfelice, Davide|inker= Gianfelice, Davide|story= Reborn Chapter One|title= Daredevil Reborn|issue= 1|date= March 2011}}</ref> Daredevil has commonly used his superhuman hearing to serve as a [[polygraph]] for interrogation by listening for changes in a person's heartbeat.

While his radar sense mostly compensates for his blindness, it has certain limitations. He cannot perceive color without touch, and he can only read printed matter if the ink is raised enough for his sense of touch.{{issue|date=April 2014}}  Most photographs, televisions, and computer screens are blank to him.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= Soule, Charles|penciller= Garney, Ron|inker= Garney, Ron|title= Daredevil|volume= 5|issue= 4|date= April 2016}}</ref> However, the radar sense has shown on numerous occasions the ability to "see" through walls and fabrics.

In his civilian identity, Murdock is a skilled and respected New York attorney. He is a skilled detective, tracker, and interrogation expert, as well as being an expert marksman.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

After his identity was publicly exposed and he was forced to relocate to San Francisco, Matt Murdock's secret identity as Daredevil was restored by the Purple Children, the children of his old foe the [[Purple Man]].

==Supporting characters==
Throughout the core ''Daredevil'' series, many characters have had an influence in Matt Murdock's life. His father, "Battlin' Jack" Murdock instills in Matt the importance of education and nonviolence with the aim of seeing his son become a better man than himself.<ref name="debut"/> He always encouraged Matt to study, rather than fight like him.

Matt Murdock's closest friend is [[Foggy Nelson|Franklin "Foggy" Nelson]], his college roommate, [[sidekick]], and law partner.<ref name="debut"/> Their relationship in the early years of the series was fraught with tension due to Nelson's sense of inferiority to Murdock as a lawyer and as a target for the affections of their secretary, [[Karen Page]]. They frequently argued over Murdock's preference for defending supervillains, as Nelson's enthusiasm is for corporate law.

Beginning with Frank Miller's run on ''Daredevil'', his traditional rogues' gallery was used less often, and [[The Kingpin]] became Daredevil's arch-enemy. Like the Purple Man, Death-Stalker, Assassin, and several others, the Kingpin has long known Daredevil's secret identity. His run as the series's central villain ended with issue #300, but he continues to menace Daredevil on occasion. Elektra made her debut as a bounty hunter, and though her time as part of Daredevil's rogues' gallery was brief (spanning barely a year of the series), her romantic past with him is an important part of the mythos. In ''Daredevil'' #254, [[Ann Nocenti]] introduced [[Typhoid Mary (comics)|Typhoid Mary]], an assassin for the Kingpin with [[dissociative identity disorder]] (the diagnostic term for multiple personalities), who would become a prominent Daredevil foe.

==Other versions==
===1602===
In [[Neil Gaiman]]'s ''[[Marvel 1602]]'', set in Earth-311, '''Matthew Murdoch'''  (known as '''The Bard''') is introduced as a blind balladeer. Secretly he is an adventurer for hire, who charges excessive prices to anyone who has the money, for any job. Matthew, as a child, was a fearless boy who would explore anywhere. One day he discovered a dark cave that glowed inside from a green substance. As a boy Matthew thought nothing of tasting it, and so he did to know what it was. He soon walked back the way he came. His mother later found him with a fever and discovered that her son is completely blind. Though he lost his sight, the rest of Matthew's senses became enhanced with superhuman sharpness. Matthew traveled as a blind beggar and poet, singing songs of heroes, and appearing weak and helpless. His true nature would be revealed when he was either on a job for a client or attacked.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

The Queen of England's head spymaster, Nicholas Fury, had hired him to hunt down and protect Donal, the Templar keeper of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]’s staff. On the way to meet Donal he encountered a woman named Natasha (aka the [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)#1602|Black Widow]]), whom he referred to as the most dangerous woman in Europe. His analysis of Natasha proved to be very accurate when she betrayed him by smashing a bottle over his head and pushing Matthew off a bridge into a canyon below. Murdoch survived, and appeared again in a dark cave just in time to save Donal from being attacked by Natasha's men. Matthew attempts to rescue Donal from her by taking him as far away as he could. But Natasha had the cave entrance surrounded with a garrison of men, sent by Count Otto von Doom of Latveria to capture the old man's treasure, Donal, and Matthew Murdoch. Doom imprisons them in one of his castle's cells and works to uncover the secrets of the golden bauble that Donal gave to him to distract him from the true treasure: the staff. Donal is also in contact with Doctor Strange, the former Queen's court magician and physician, who informs them that a group of heroes are on their way to the castle.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

When the imprisoned Captain of the [[Fantastic Four]] rails against his stone prison, it shakes the castle from its foundations and frees Murdoch and Donal. Murdoch uses his abilities to carry the old man and leap from wall to wall to the courtyard many feet below. When Doom's men corner them, after Donal demands to find his staff, the old man uses it to transform himself into the Thunder God, Thor. Thor uses his immortal powers to stop Doom's men and assist [[Alternative versions of Professor X#1602|Carlos Javier]]’s witchbreed in their attack on Doom's castle, finally allowing Doom to use Thor's electricity to explode the golden sphere that Donal had given him, scarring Doom and bringing him to the brink of death. While Donal-as Thor-joins the group aboard their ship, headed to the New World to fix the tear in their universe, Murdoch uses his own means to leave Latveria.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

Murdoch later appears to King James, in the dark, threatening to cut his throat if he ever attacked the late Queen's spymaster, Fury. He then disappears through the window, promising to return again if James is untrue to his word, and with a final warning not to touch his home land of Ireland.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

===Age of Apocalypse===
In the ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]'' timeline (Earth-295), '''Keeper Murdock''' serves [[Mikhail Rasputin]], one of Apocalypse's [[Horsemen of Apocalypse|Four Horsemen]]. Exposure to toxic waste during his time in one of Apocalypse's labor camps for humans caused Murdock's blindness and powers, though he believed his powers were granted by an implant given to him by Rasputin. When he accidentally touched the incapacitated [[Empath (comics)|Empath]], he realized the error of his ways, he then put Empath out of his misery by beating him to death with his Billy Club.{{issue|date=February 2013}}
Renouncing Mikhail, Murdock ripped off his visor and realized that his enhanced senses were not the result of his cybernetic augmentation. Murdock broke down upon realizing how many years Mikhail had been manipulating him.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

Ten years later, Murdock is seen working for Weapon Omega, Apocalypse's replacement. He serves as the keeper of New Apocalypse city, using his sense to monitor humans who try to enter the city. He is seen hunting for Harper Simmons and fights with Prophet hand to hand but was defeated with a poison gas that allowed Prophet escape with the X-Terminators.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

===Amalgam===
In the [[Amalgam Comics]] universe, '''Slade Murdock''' is a blind mercenary in New Gotham City acting under the name of "[[Dare the Terminator]]", because of the dares she takes, and that few dare to challenge her.

===Earth X===

First, in an interesting visual pun, [[Kurt Wagner (comics)|Kurt Wagner]] eventually goes back in time to become the red-skinned demon Belasco.

Secondly, in the afterlife, Matthew Murdock is shown as part of the Avenging Host.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

Thirdly (and most prominently) an invulnerable stunt man, thought by the Thing to be [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]], goes by the name of Daredevil, as well as donning a costume that looks somewhere between that of Daredevil and [[Evel Knievel]]. This version craves his own death. Ben Grimm repeatedly tries to guess at Daredevil's identity, guessing Deadpool at first and then a string of other obscure Marvel characters, but Daredevil denies being any one of them. Eventually [[Machine Man]] confronts Daredevil and reveals that he was never any previously known Marvel character - he is an original character from the Earth X universe.{{issue|date=February 2013}}
