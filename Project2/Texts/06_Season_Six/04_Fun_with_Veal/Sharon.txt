Officer Barbrady. What can I do for you? Stole? A-a-are you sure?  Not now - my son is not a thief. I'm sure this is just some kind of a misunderstanding.  Stanley, what are you doing with those calves? Stanley, this isn't up for discussion. The rancher is gonna take his cows back and  Stanley! Stanley, you open this door right now or you're gonna get it! Open this door, now! I apologize for this, Mr. Rancher Person. I can't lie to my son, okay? If I betrayed him like that, I'd pay for it the rest of my life. And so that's the situation. Our boys have locked themselves in Stan's room until we can promise them the calves will live free, in writing. Well excuse me, Sheila, but it wasn't that simple!  That was very impressive.  Very persuasive. Alright, Stanley, this has gone on long enough! Your little game is over! Well that's fine! You boys can just stay in there and starve to death. Us parents are going to go to Pizza Shack and have pepperoni pizzas and ice cream. You'll have to come out sooner or later, boys. The longer you wait, the more trouble you'll be in.  Ms. Cartman, this is a battle of wills. We need our boys to know that we're not gonna cave in, at all. Ms. Cartman, what are you doing?  You're giving my baby guns? What??
