Mr. Adler? Yeah, you are! You ''always get in trouble''.  Dude, shop class sucks. Maybe we ''should have'' taken home ec. Do you wanna bet? Dude, because! You have to stand up for yourself! So will you fight him?  There. Did you see? He just flipped you off. So, do you agree to fight him after school? We'll see! Yeah. That's not cool, dude.  Tweek and Craig are gonna fight. What? Aw, they wanna fight! They just don't know it yet!   Tweek? Well, Craig showed up. And then Craig was all like, "Tweek is scared o'me. He's a big chicken." And he started doing an impersonation of you being a chicken;  well, everybody in the world saw it! Well, everyone in the world thinks you are. See ya.  He'll view it as a challenge when he's getting his ass kicked! Shut up, fatass!! That's more than ten bucks, you stupid fatass! Tweek's gonna fight Craig! Time for you to get proven wrong, fat boy. No I won't, because you'd eat 'em first, tubby.  How??  Not like that! Fine! Come on, Tweek! He's only got one arm! Remember, Tweek: punch hard, punch low. This is when you gotta get mean, Tweek. Go, Tweek. Kick his ass! Get him! Get him!  Whoa, Tweek! Did you hear ''that''? Craig just called you a boner!  We'll just have to keep throwing jabs to win the fight. You bastards! Yeah. See, we got you to fight just 'cause we wanted to see who was the toughest. We made up all that stuff we said to get you guys mad at each other.  Boy, do we ever. Yeah. And then Craig's family came on and said Tweek was the wuss, and then punched Tweek's mom in the hooters.
