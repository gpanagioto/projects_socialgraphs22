Oh, I have to admit I'm still embarrassed about getting a nose job, Tom. I didn't want people at school to know, so I told them I had herpes. Wow! Isn't that amazing Mr. Hat? Hmmm. Oh, that's not bad. WOW! That's it! That's the nose I want! I can live with that. Where-eh, where am I? Uuf, I feel weak. How do I look? Ah-I feel kinda nauseous. Aauugh-huh. UUUUUuuuuuugh Bluuuch...Bluuuch...Bluuuch...Oh, stop, that movie was terrible! Wuch, uch. Boy I had to see the entire movie to see the alien and it was her goddamned father! Well? Wwooww, that's a pretty good nose job. What do you think, Mr. Hat? Hi, Mrs. Campbell. Really? No, but thanks for asking. Wow, Mr. Hat. Having a nose job is even better than I thought. There's a whole world of opportunity opening up in front of us. Hello there, children! Children, I have a very important announcement to make. I'm quitting my job as a teacher. It's strange, but suddenly I feel really confident about myself, and I've decided to quit teaching, and do what I've always dreamed of doing: hang out and screw hot chicks. But the good news is, I've already talked to Principal Victoria about it and Ms. Ellen can stay on as your permanent teacher. I'm a lady ''killer'', Mr. Hat. A ''few hundred''? Hoh, boy, I'm gonna need some more smack. Boy I'll tell you something Mr. Hat. Being hot and sexy is fun for a while, but it sure does get boring. What the...? Whoa-hey-way-wait-aaah. Aaaah. Mr. Hat! Save yourself! Hoh, Mr. Hat, I hate this! I wish I'd never had a nose job. Damn this beautiful face of mine! Damn it to hell!! We have to get the surgery again, Mr. Hat. I want to be the old me again!
