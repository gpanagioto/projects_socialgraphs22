Hell's Pass Hospital. Sharon and Dr. Doctor stand before Shelly's bed.

Dr. Doctor

It's a good thing we got her to the hospital in time.

Sharon

But what's wrong with her?

Dr. Doctor

It's chickenpox. There seems to be a small epidemic going around. Your daughter never had the chickenpox as a little child, I take it?

Sharon

No, no, she's been perfectly healthy.

Dr. Doctor

Well, that's the problem. You see, chickenpox is a pretty normal thing for young children, but as you get older it becomes a more and more ferocious disease.

-----


The door opens and Stan enters.

Sharon

[Sweetly.] Shelly, look who's come to visit you; your little brother, Stan.

Shelly

[In disgust.] Oh, whoo-peee!

Dr. Doctor

You know, most people don't realize that chickenpox is actually a form of herpes.

Stan

Dude, you've got herpes on your face!

Shelly

Shut up, brat!

Sharon

[With some urgency.] Will my daughter be okay?

Dr. Doctor

She'll be fine.

Shelly

[Stan scratches her cheek.] Stop it!

Dr. Doctor

We just want to be cautious and monitor her here.

-----


A crash is heard, and Sharon and Dr. Doctor look on in surprise.

Stan

Ow!

-----


Shelly has knocked Stan to the floor.

Sharon

Come on, Stanley. Give your sister a kiss and then we have to go.

-----


The Broflovski house. Sharon, Sheila, and Liane are seated at the dining room table. Ike is playing in his high chair.

Sharon

...and then the doctor said that it's much worse as you get older. My daughter is in pretty bad shape now, but if she were in her twenties, she could die.

Sheila

My God, I never knew chickenpox was such a dangerous illness.

Liane

I guess it's much better to get it when you're young.

Sharon

So tell me if I'm crazy, but I started thinking that we should intentionally have our boys play with a child who has the chickenpox. Let them get it now, while they're young.

Sheila

That's not crazy at all, Sharon. Mothers do it all the time.

Liane

Oh, yes. When I was a child, my mother had me go over to a little girl's house who had the chickenpox, just so I would get it.

Sharon

So it's not such a crazy idea after all?

Sheila

Noo, no. And I'm pretty sure that strange little boy Kenny has the chickenpox right now.

-----


Kyle, Stan, and Cartman walk up to the table.

Kyle

Are you guys having a meeting or something?

Sheila

How would you boys like to have a little slumber party at your friend Kenny's house tonight?

Cartman

No way, dude. Kenny's family's poor; they live in the ghetto.

Kyle

Yeah. Let's just have a slumber party here.

Sharon

Boys, you're going to sleep over at Kenny's, and that's final.

Cartman

Oh weak!

-----


The boys have gone home to gather their things. Now they meet up and walk to Kenny's house.

Kyle

I wonder why our moms want us to sleep over at Kenny's so bad.

Stan

Yeah, it's pretty weird.

-----


The boys cross some railroad tracks.

Kyle

Well, all I can say is, he's better have Nintendo.

-----


They come upon a house with an orange cat and a small gray dog milling around. Strewn about the yard are a motor, a sofa, a refrigerator, a pack of beer bottles...

Kyle

Well, here's Kenny's house.

Cartman


In the ghetto
On a cold and gray Chicago morn
Another little baby child is born
In the ghetto... In the ghetto




-----


Stan knocks on the door and Stuart McCormick answers, beer in hand.

Stuart

Yeah?

Stan

We're here to have a slumber party with Kenny.

Stuart

What? Don't you know Kenny's sick with--?

Carol

[Intruding.] That's the whole point, remember? Their moms want them to catch it while they're young.

Stuart

Oh yeah.

Stan

Catch what?

Carol

Nothin'. Uhco-uh, come on in, I was jus' makin' dinner.

-----


The boys follow the parents in. Shag carpeting, another sofa, an engine block doubling as a coffee table, a beer sign...

Cartman


And his momma cried
'Cause if there's one thing that she don't need
Is another little hungry mouth to feed
In the ghetto In the ghetto




-----


Stuart sits in his armchair.

Stan

Sshh! Cartman!

Cartman

What?

Carol

[Setting the table.] Kenny, your little friends are here! Come play with them!

Kenny

(No, Mom, I'm seriously sick!)

Carol

I know you're sick! Now get your buns out here!

Kyle

Heheheh, buns.

Kenny

[Walks up to the other boys.] (Hey you guys, what's goin' on?)

Stan

Whoa, dude! You've got herpes on your face, too!

Cartman

[Scanning the room.] Where is the Nintendo?

Stuart

We don't have a Nintendo. We got a ColecoVision hooked up to the black-and-white TV.

-----


Rats scurry near the TV.

Kyle

Oh my God. This is like a third-world country.

Carol

[Now finished setting table.] Throw your sleeping bags in Kenny's room and then come grab some dinner.

Cartman

Oh, good. I'm starving.

-----


The boys are seated, as are Kenny's parents. Kenny's older brother comes to table. All there is to eat is a plate of 5 or 6 frozen waffles and a toaster to toast them in. The boys can only wonder.

Carol

Let's say grace.

-----


The boys put their hands together.

Stuart

Lord, we thank you for this staggering payload of frozen waffles you have bestowed upon us. And since we have been faithful to you, we know that you will send us some good fortune one of these days, even though you sure as hell seem to be taking your sweet time. Amen.

All

Amen.

Cartman

Pfff..!

Carol

Okay, let's dig in.

-----


She drops a waffle into the toaster.

Kevin

That one's mine, that one's mine!

Cartman

[Coolly.] What kind of side dishes will we be enjoying this evening with our frozen waffles?

-----


Everyone stops and waits.

Cartman

Am I to understand there will be no side dishes?

Stuart

So, Kyle, your dad's still bringing home those big, fat lawyer paychecks?

Kyle

I don't know.

Carol

Stuart, don't even get started!

-----


She points at him.

Stuart

[To his wife.] What? I'm just askin' a question. [To Kyle.] You know, your dad and I used to be best friends when we were teenagers. We would work together at Pizza Shack. But he got promoted and went off to community college and I didn't. And you know why? 'Cause your dad's Jewish!

Cartman

Puh! I heard that.

Carol

That ain't why, Stuart! [Sadness creeps into her voice.] It's because you are an alcoholic retard and he had dreams of not eating frozen waffles for dinner every night!

Stuart

Hey, is it my fault you don't know how to cook?!

Carol

What am I supposed to do with frozen waffles, clamhead?! You put 'em in the toaster and you cook 'em!

Stuart

You just don't know how to use spices and stuff.

Kevin

[Gleefully.] My waffle's d-hun, my waffle's d-hu-hun!

Carol

Now Kevin, we ain't got enough for everybody. You have to split that with your brother.

Cartman

Oh, Jesus, are you fucking kidding me?

Stuart

Hey! We don't say "fuck" at the table, you little asshole!

Cartman

[Hushed.] Heh, we apparently don't say 'side dishes' at the table, either.

Kenny

(Aa-choo!)

Carol

Kenny, honey, if you're going to sneeze, sneeze on them.

Stan

Huh?

Kenny

[Turning towards Cartman.] (Waa-choo!)

Cartman

[Recoiling.] Ey!

-----


Cartman closes both his eyes, but then opens the right one. Later, in Kenny's room. Kenny has two posters of bikini-clad women and one of a 4X4 monster truck. His curtains are tatters and his dresser drawer is a battered suitcase. His bed has no frame to rest on.

Cartman

Man, your family sucks ass, Kenny. Whoever heard of frozen waffles for dinner?

Kyle

Come on! Let's just get in our sleeping bags and get this night over with.

-----


The boys go to their respective sleeping bags while Kenny goes to his bed. The boys roll down their bags and Stan and Kyle have Terrance and Phillip sleeping bags, Cartman however...

Kyle

Cartman, what the hell is that?

Cartman

It's my Urkel sleeping bag. Isn't it coool?

Kyle

No, it's not cool!

Stan

Dude, I think I just saw a rat!

Cartman

Argh! You have rats in your house, too, Kenny?!

Kenny

(Uh-huh.)

Cartman

Dude, seriously, you'd better stop being so poor, or else I'm gonna start huckin' rocks atcha.

Stan

I don't think it's very healthy to sleep with rats.

Kenny

(Well, there's gonna be a bunch of rats until they put the freakin' ceiling in.)

Stan

Oh.

-----


The boys settle into their sleeping blankets, and Kenny claps twice, making the lights go out.

Kenny

(Aa-choo!)

-----


The next day. The boys have gone back home. First up: Stan's house. Stan has a thermometer in his mouth and his skin is starting to break out.

Sharon

Okay, lemme see.

-----


She withdraws the thermometer, and reads it.

Sharon

Oh, goody! You've got a fever!

Stan

[Mad.] Goody? What do you mean, "goody"?!

Sharon

Yyup, it looks like you've got chickenpox alright.

Stan

Chickenpo--? Oh no, I must have caught it from Kenny last night.

Sharon

Oh, gee, I guess you did.

Stan

Well, you sure seem happy about it!

Sharon

All right, it's off to bed with you, young man.

-----


Cartman's house. Cartman is on the sofa scratching at his skin.

Liane

Don't scratch it, hon.

Cartman

[Whining.] But mom, seriously, it itches. I can't stand it!

Liane

No, hon.

Cartman

[Whining.] Mom, seriously, it itches. It itches!

Liane

Here, I got you some calamine lotion.

-----


She hands the bottle to him.

Cartman

I don't wanna.

Liane

It'll make your itches go away.

-----


She opens the bottle and rubs some lotion on his face.

Cartman

Ugh. Uunnh.

-----


She stops.

Cartman

Ey, give me that!

-----


He takes the bottle and rubs some more lotion on his face.

Cartman

Ahhhh...

Liane

Not too much, hon. It says on the bottle that too much can be bad.

Cartman

More calamine lotion!

-----


Kyle's house. His parents look him over.

Sheila

I don't understand it. He's perfectly healthy.

Kyle

Yeah. I feel great!

Sheila

Are you sure you stayed over at Kenny's house?

Kyle

Yeah, dude. I told you, we had bread sandwiches for breakfast.

Sheila

Did you sleep in the same room?

Kyle

Yes. Why?

Sheila

Bubbe, how would you like to spend the night at your friend Kenny's house again?

Kyle

No way, dude! It sucked ass! They don't even have cable!

Sheila

Well I think you need to spend more time with your friends.

Kyle

Kenny's not really my friend, Ma. I don't give a rat's ass about him.

Sheila

I'm gonna give Mrs. McCormick a call.

Kyle

Aawwww! Hey Dad. Is it true that you and Kenny's dad used to be best friends when you were young?

Gerald

Who? Stuart? Yeah, yeah, I guess we were.

Kyle

Well how come Kenny's family eats frozen waffles for dinner and has rats on the floor, and we have a big house and lots of food?

Gerald

Well, because Kenny's family doesn't have as much money as we do.

Kyle

But why? If they're hungry and poor, why don't we just always give them half of our food?

Gerald

Ha ha ha ha ha! Ooh-ho boy, have you got a lot to learn! Sit down, son.

-----


Gerald sits and motions for Kyle to sit on his lap.

Gerald

You see, Kyle, we humans work as a society, and in order for a society to thrive, we need gods, and clods.

Kyle

Gods and clods?

Gerald

Yes. You see, I spent a lot of time going to law school, and I was able to go because I have a slightly higher intellect than others. But I still need people to pump my gas, and make my French fries, and fix my laundry machine when it breaks down.

Kyle

Oooohh, I see. Gods and clods!

Gerald

That's right. So Kenny's family is happy just the way they are, and we're all a functioning part of America.

-----


Stan's house, night time. Stan is in bed, motionless.

Sharon

[Enters.] Stanley, can I get you anything else?

-----


She draws closer and feels his forehead.

Sharon

Stanley? Oh my God! Randy?! Randy, hurry, he's burning up!

-----


Next day, Hell's Pass Hospital. Stan now lies next to Shelly. Their parents are also present.

Sharon

Don't you worry, Stanley, you're going to be okay.

Dr. Doctor

[Entering.] Can I talk to you outside?

Sharon

Kids, Daddy and I are gonna be right back, okay?

Stan

Okay.

Shelly

[Now that they're alone.] Serves you right, you little brat!

Stan

Well at least I'm not gonna die from it like you might! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

Shelly

If I die from this, I'm taking you with me!

TV Voice

["Passion Cramps"] Will Carol find out she's a fa...

Stan

I don't wanna watch this! I wanna watch Terrance and Phillip!

Shelly

[Threatening] We're watching this!

Stan

Well I've got the remote, bitch! Hahaha. [Click.]

Phillip

Say, Terrance? Will you check my ass for abnormalities?

-----


Phillip raises his leg high.

Terrance

Sure thing, Phillip.

-----


Terrance sticks his head in there, and Phillip farts on him.

Terrance

Ah ha ha ha, you got me again!

-----


Stan laughs.

Phillip

That's tomfoolery.

-----


Stan laughs, as do Terrance and Phillip.

Shelly

Give me the remote!

Stan

No way, dude! We're gonna watch Terrance and Phillip all day--

-----


She reaches over to his bed, presses a switch, and his bed folds in on him.

Stan

Ey! Get me out of here!

-----


Shelly takes the remote and switches channels.

TV Voice

["Passion Cramps"] She was...

-----


Meanwhile, outside the room.

Dr. Doctor

He'll be okay, but it's a good idea for us to monitor him for a while.

Sharon

[Anxious.] Oh God, what have we done?

Dr. Doctor

There there now, it's not your fault.

Randy

Doctor, we-uuuh purposefully sent our son to stay with a friend who had chickenpox so that he would get it early.

Dr. Doctor

Oh, wow, you did? Wow. You guys suck.

-----


Kenny's house. Kyle and his mom are visiting. She's talking with Mrs. McCormick in the dining room. Kenny and Kyle enter.

Kyle

Could we go home now, Ma?

Sheila

No, bubbeleh. You play with Kenny some more.

Kyle

But we've been playing for eight hours. We can't think of anything else to do.

Sheila

I've got a great game for you. It's called "ookie mouth".

Kyle

What's "ookie mouth"?

Sheila

First, you let Kenny spit in your mouth. Then you try to swallow his spit and say "ookie mouth" at the same time.

Kyle

Sick, dude!

Sheila

No, no, bubbe, it's loads of fun. Try it.

-----


Kenny and Kyle look at each other and walk away.

Sheila

That ought to take care of it.

Carol

You want some more hot water?

Sheila

Oh, no thank you. It's terrific though, it's-- You don't have any tea bags or coffee grounds to go in the hot water, do you?

Carol

Naw, we don't go for that hoity-toity rich folk stuff.

Sheila

I see. Well, you certainly have aab- humble home, Mrs. McCormick.

Carol

Yehah, well, unfortunately my husband is a washed-up hunk of shit!

Sheila

Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

Kyle

Ookie mouth! [Kenny spits in.] Gross! I can't do it, Ma!

Sheila

Try again, bubbe!

-----


Kenny spits in Kyle's mouth again.

Kyle

Argh!

Sheila

You know, your husband and mine used to work together as teenagers.

Carol

Oh they wuz best friends; you couldn't separate 'em.

Sheila

Really? I met Gerald in college, so I didn't know. What happened to them?

Carol

Oh they jus' grew apart, I guess. I think Stuart's a little jealous that your husband got out of makin' pizzas and went on to make somethin' of hisself.

Sheila

Well that's too bad. I'm sure your husband's a fine man.

Carol

Oh, hell no! He's a nugget o' deer turd.

Sheila

But if they were such good friends it seems silly that they don't even talk anymore. Let's get them together!

Carol

Uh-I don't know.

Sheila

We'll just arrange a little fishing trip for them or something.

-----


Kyle returns with Kenny.

Kyle

I can't say "ookie mouth" and have Kenny spit down my throat at the same time. It's impossible.

-----


Kyle's face and hat are covered in spit.

Sheila

Practice makes perfect, bubbe.

-----


Cartman's house. Cartman's on the sofa watching TV, scratching his face.

Cartman

Dammit, where's that calamine lotion?!

Terrance

[With clipboard.] Phillip, I've got good news, and bad news.

Phillip

Give it to me straight, Terrance.

Terrance

The good news is, you have a clean bill of health.

Phillip

Oh, what a relief!

Terrance

The bad news is, you have cancer.

-----


Cartman is shocked.

Phillip

Cancer?

Terrance

Yes. I'm afraid your ass is collapsing.

Phillip

My ass is collapsing?

Terrance

Yes. See this X-ray? [Turns it on.] That's your ass. See this line? [Points to it.] That's your ass collapsing. Your ass is collapsing.

Phillip

Will this mean that I won't be able to fart anymore?

Terrance

No, it means that you won't be able to live anymore.

-----


They both laugh.

Cartman

[Somber.] Oh, no. [The itching returns.] Damnit!

-----


Mr. Kitty strolls by.

Cartman

No, Kitty! That's a-- Wait a minute. Come 'ere, Kitty!

-----


Kitty jumps up and Cartman uses him as a scrubber.

Cartman

Uh. Yes. Uh...

Liane

[Closing a door.] I'm back, hon. I got some more calamine lotion.

Cartman

[Releases Mr. Kitty.] It's about friggin' time! Give me that!

-----


He grabs the bag and hurries up the stairs.

Liane

Just use a little bit of that stuff, hon. It has to last a while.

-----


Cartman reaches the bathroom and closes the door. Then he opens the bag and pulls out six bottles of the lotion and pours them into the tub. Then he undresses and jumps into the tub.

Cartman

Uugh! Yeessss. [His voice trails off.] Ooohhh yyou guys, seriiously, it calms yer ass. Ahhhh...

-----


He sinks into the water blissfully as bubbles pop around him. Meanwhile, Gerald and Stuart are driving to the river for a fishing trip.

Stuart

I didn't know you like to fish, Gerry.

Gerald

Oh, yeah, love it! I haven't done it for a while, though. I had to go out and buy a few things, you know a-. A rod and a reel and an uh, uuh...

Stuart

Tackle box?

Gerald

Yeah, tackle box. [Stretches.] Man, smell that mountain air. What a great Saturday morning; aren't weekends just the best?

Stuart

When you're uh-unemployed, weekends are meaningless.

Gerald

Right. Right-right.

-----


Monday afternoon, South Park Elementary. The dismissal bell rings.

Mr. Garrison

And so, children, that's how you tell a prostitute from a policeman. Now, are there any questions?

-----


Kyle raises his hand.

Mr. Garrison

Yes, Kyle?

Kyle

What the hell does that have to do with American history?

Mr. Garrison

Uh, that's a good question, Kyle. Are there any other questions?

Kyle

Mr. Garrison, I'm the only one here. Everyone else has chicken herpes.

Mr. Garrison

Right, right. Uhh... Well, class, I'm going to assign you all a paper. The theme of the paper will be, "How I would make America better."

Kyle

What?! Does everybody have to do it, or just me?

Mr. Garrison

Uh, don't worry, Kyle. I'm sending homework to all the children who are out sick. They'll have to turn in a paper, too.

-----


Hell's Pass Hospital.

Stan

Homework?! But I'm in the hospital!

Sharon

Well, your teacher sent this stuff over for you to do while you're sick.

Stan

That son of a bitch! What kind of sick weirdo is he?

Sharon

Now, Stanley, I know at your age teachers can seem cold and heartless, but later, you'll understand that he did this for your own good.

Stan

Not Mr. Garrison, Ma. He really is a sick weirdo.

Randy

Yeah, it's-it's true, he is.

Sharon

Oh. Well, anyway, here's a pencil and some paper.

Stan

Wait! Where are you going?

Randy

We're going down to-uhh Happy Burger for some milkshakes.

Stan

Milkshakes?!

Sharon

Yeah, and then we're going to the movies.

Randy

See ya, son. [They leave.]

Stan

Weak!

-----


Kyle's house. Kyle is on the sofa working on his paper.

Kyle

"So this is how America works. We have gods and clods. My dad says America needs both rich and poor to survive, but I have a better idea."

-----


Kyle puts down the pen and paper and walks over to the kitchen.

Sheila

No I don't understand it, Dr. Schwartz, he's perfectly healthy.

-----


Sheila is on the phone, Kyle is over by the microwave.

Sheila

He's been over at Kenny's house three days in a row and still hasn't caught the chickenpox.

Kyle

[Softly.] What?

Sheila

I don't know what else to do. We sent the other boys over and they all got sick, but I can't get my little Kyle to catch it.

Kyle

[Frightened.] Oh my God!

Sheila

[Turns.] Kyle, what are you doing there, honey?

Kyle

[Angry.] You!

Sheila

[Subdued.] I'll call you back, Dr. Schwartz.

-----


She hangs up.

Kyle

You!

Sheila

[Walks over.] What, bubbeleh, what is it?

Kyle

You sent us over to Kenny's house on purpose! You wanted us to get sick!

Sheila

Oy. It was for your own good, Kyle. I wanted you to get chickenpox while you were young.

Kyle

Why?! So I could be sitting in the hospital waiting to die, like Stan?!

Sheila

Now, Kyle, come here.

Kyle

You get away from me, you crazy woman!

-----


He runs off.

Sheila

Hoh boy.

-----


Down by the riverside. Stuart and Gerald are fishing.

Stuart

Beer?

Gerald

Huh? Oh, uh, no thanks, I brought my own. Microbrew sampler from Aspen. Has six different beers from local breweries.

-----


Stuart is expressionless.

Gerald

Sahay, remember that time we built the fort in your mom's back yard?

Stuart

Hu hu hu hu heh yeah. It took us damn near two years to finish it.

Gerald

Hahah. Whatever happened to that old hunk o' junk? Haha--

Stuart

[Soberly.] That's where I live now.

Gerald

Oh, right.

-----


Hell's Pass Hospital. Stan is working on his paper.

Stan

And so that's why Knight Rider was the best show in America.

Kyle

[Rushing in.] Stan! Stan!

Stan

[Pointing to Shelly.] Sshh. Wake her up and we're both dead.

Kyle

[Softly.] Sorry, sorry. You know how after we spent the night at Kenny's house and-and you and Cartman got sick with chickenpox?

Stan

Yeah.

Kyle

Dude! Our parents sent us over there to get us sick!

Stan

What are you talking about?

Kyle

They knew that staying at Kenny's house would get us sick, and they made us do it anyway.

Stan

They did?

Kyle

Yeah. And I think I figured out why.

Stan

Why?

Kyle

Because they're a bunch of assholes.

Stan

[Long gasp.] Of course!

Kyle

Come on, dude. We've gotta get out of here. I don't know what they're planning next, but it can't be good!

-----


They rush out of the room, meanwhile, back at Cartman's house. Cartman is back in the tub, now working on his paper. Calamine lotion bottles line the tub and litter the floor outside.

Cartman

"I hope that one day America could be more like Endor, where the Ewoks live. Endor is very cool."

-----


The doorbell rings.

Cartman

Mom, answer that! "They have trees and Ewoks, and barbecues, which is why I like Endor more than America. It's cool."

-----


Kyle and Stan rush into the bathroom.

Kyle

Cartman, do you remember how we all spent the night at Kenny's a couple of days ago?

Cartman

I remember frozen waffles with no side dishes.

Stan

Cartman, our parents sent us over there to catch chickenpox from Kenny!

Kyle

Yeah, dude. Your mom wanted you to have herpes on your face.

Cartman

She what?!

Stan

It's some kind of parental conspiracy. Our parents are trying to kill us or something.

Cartman

That bitch! I'm gonna go downstairs and kick her square in the nuts!

Kyle

No-no-no-no. Come on, fatass, we're gonna get 'em all back.

-----


Down by the riverside...

Gerald

Well, I'm sure you'll find another job soon. Something'll come along.

Stuart

Not that easy. You were lucky.

Gerald

Now, now-I, I wasn't lucky.

Stuart

You had rich parents. You got to go to that expensive community college.

Gerald

Hey! I worked my ass off to get to where I am today! [Rising.] I wanted to be somebody!

Stuart

[Rising.] I wanted to be somebody, too! I just wasn't born with a silver enema up my ass!

Gerald

You're just jealous. You're a bitter old drunk, just like your father!

-----


Stuart punches him down.

Gerald

Ow!! [Gets up.]

Stuart

Now don't make me do that again!

-----


Stuard hits him again.

Gerald

Ow! You son of a bitch!

-----


Gerald chokes Stuart. They start tugging at each other.

Stuart

Uh!

Gerald

Ow!

Stuart

Oh!

Gerald

Ow!

-----


Gerald ends up on the ground again.

Stuart

Eeaagghh!

-----


Stuart jumps and does an elbow drop on Gerald.

Gerald

[In pain.] Huuuh!

-----


Hell's Pass Hospital. Stan's parents are visiting.

Randy

Doctor?

Dr. Doctor

Yes?

Randy

Wh-where's Stan?

Dr. Doctor

Stan?

Randy

Stan, our son?

Dr. Doctor

Oh, yes. Where is Stan?

Sharon

You mean Stanley's missing?

Dr. Doctor

No, no. He's not missing. We just... can't seem to find him at this moment.

Sharon

[To Randy.] Oh my God! Our son ran away!

Randy

Will he be okay out of the hospital?

Dr. Doctor

Oh sure, sure. But we have to get him back soon. If he doesn't get his antibiotic shot today, he could die.

Sharon

Die?

Dr. Doctor

Yes, die. It won't be any easy death, either. The chickenpox will slowly move down his trachea into his lungs.

Randy

Okay, well well, let's go look--

Dr. Doctor

As he chokes for breath, the pox will move through his inner ear into his brain, making him think he's David Duchovny.

Sharon

Oh God, no!

Randy

I'm-I'm sure he couldn't have gone far.

Dr. Doctor

Now moving on all fours and wheezing uncontrollably, his cellular structure will regress into a gelatinous mass of--

-----


Kyle's house. Sheila looks after Ike, who plays with a toy truck. Gerald enters. His entire outfit is torn, he has a black eye and his fishing line is all mangled.

Sheila

So how was it? Did you boys have a good time fishing?

Gerald

That son of a bitch ripped my parka!

Sheila

Catch anything?

Gerald

I just don't get it.

-----


He drops the pole.

Gerald

Why would he invite me fishing and then turn into a complete bastard?

Sheila

Well, darling, I have to tell you something. He didn't invite you. I set the whole thing up.

Gerald

What? Now why the hell would you knowingly deceive me like that?

Sheila

I thought it would be good for you.

Gerald

Just like you deceived our son into going to Kenny's; and that didn't work either!

Sheila

[Exasperated, she leaves.] I'm doing the best I can!

-----


Gerald picks up Kyle's paper on the sofa and looks over it.

"My Final Solution by Kyle Broflovski."
"My dad is the smartest guy in the whole wide world. He has taught me that all poor people are actually things called clods. I wanna live in a world of only gods, so my idea to make America better is put all the poor people into camps."


Gerald

What?!

-----


"If we get rid of them, there will be nothing but rich people. And there won't be any hunger, poverty, or homeless people. 'Cause they'll all be dead. The end."

Gerald

Oh, God, what have I done?

-----


Chef's house. He's watching Terrance and Phillip. Terrance and Phillip are both on operating tables with only their heads and asses exposed.

Phillip

What's happening here, Terrance?

Terrance

We're doing an anal transplant. It's our only hope.

Phillip

Who's the donor?

Terrance

I am, Phillip. I am.

Phillip

Terrance, you're giving up your ass for me?

Terrance

Just half my ass. Can you believe it, Phillip? Best friends, and now we're going to share the same ass.

-----


Someone is knocking on Chef's door.

Chef

Oh, damn it, not now!

-----


Chef goes to answer the door. Stan, Kyle and Cartman wait.

Chef

Damn it! Children, what are you doing here? Terrance and Phillip are about to go into surgery!

Kyle

Chef, we wanna know about herpes.

Chef

What makes you think I would know anything about that?

Kyle

Well I don't know. You're just the only grownup we trust.

Stan

How does someone get herpes?

Chef

Well you get it by sharin' relations with somebody who already has it. You have to be very careful around someone who has herpes.

Kyle

Do you know anybody with herpes?

Chef

Well, there's old Frida down on Main Street. She has a mouthful of herpes. You need to stay away from her.

Stan

But what if we want to give somebody herpes?

Chef

Oh, then, Frida's the right person to go to.

Kyle

Cool! Thanks, Chef!

Chef

O-kay!

-----


He closes the door and goes back to his armchair. The boys leave.

Chef

Wait a minute. What the hell did I just do?

-----


Main Street. Randy and Sharon drive around looking for Stan.

Sharon

Stanley?

Randy

Stan?

Sharon

[Softly.] Oh, Stanley, where are you..?

Randy

Stan?

Sharon

Stanley!

-----


The car makes a right two blocks down, and the kids appear a block closer. They walk up the block and see an old redhead smoking a cigarette.

Kyle

Are you old Frida?

Frida

[Raspily.] Who wants to know?

Kyle

Someone who wants a favor.

Frida

Ten dollars a lay, five dollars a b-- [Snorts.]

Kyle

[To Stan, throws his hands up.] Huh?

Cartman

We want you to give our parents herpes.

Frida

[Puffs out.] Five dollars.

Stan

My dad has five dollars on top of his dresser. [Coughs.]

Kyle

Damn, you sound pretty sick. Maybe you should go back to the hospital.

Stan

And have Shelly kick my ass? No thanks. Plus, I have to get my parents back just as much as you do.

-----


The Monkee's "I'm a Believer" plays. The boys hire Frida, and take her to each of their houses. First stop, Stan's house. She goes into the bathroom and uses Randy's and Sharon's toothbrushes. Stan and Kyle smile, then Stan gives a thumbs up in approval. In the kitchen, Frida chugs away at a jar of milk, then sends the milk right back into the jar. Next stop, Kyle's house. She goes into the master bedroom and uses Sheila's lipsticks. Then she goes to the kitchen and soils the silverware by putting each and every utensil under her armpits. Stan and Kyle jump for joy and high-five each other. Last stop, Cartman's house. She goes into Liane's room and pulls out some panties, then rubs them all over her face. Cartman jumps for joy. They all return to Stan's house, and she licks away at some wine glasses and the phone receiver. Stan and Kyle high-five each other again. Finally, they pay her and she leaves.

Stan

Thanks a lot, Frida!

Frida

[Hacks.] Don't mention it.

-----


She hacks again, pockets the money, and walks away.

Kyle

D-hude, this is gonna be so killer. They're all gonna get herpes!

Boys

Hooray!

-----


Stan coughs and the adults burst into the room. Fear strikes the boys.

Randy

Stanley, where the hell have you been?

Sharon

Damn it, Stanley, you had us worried sick! You have to get back to the hospital for a shot!

Stan

[Hiding behind Kyle.] I don't wanna go back there.

Randy

[Coming for him.] Come on, we're taking you back to the hospital.

-----


Randy drags him off.

Stan

Don't you guys feel like brushing your teeth first?

Randy

What?

Stan

You know, freshen up your breath.

Kyle

Aw, man. [Tottering, eyes half shut.] I don't feel so good.

Sheila

[Pleased.] Oh good, maybe you finally caught the chicken--

Kyle

Ugh...

-----


Kyle falls back, passing out.

Sheila

Kyle!!

-----


Hell's Pass Hospital. All four boys are now in recovery.

Dr. Doctor

Well, I hope you boys learned your lesson. Going out and playing around with chickenpox almost killed you all.

Kyle

We're sorry.

Dr. Doctor

Well just be thankful we got you here in time. Your parents are here to see you, I'll send them in.

Kyle

This itches! Give me some of that calamine lotion, Cartman.

Cartman

Hell no, you guys get your own!

-----


The parents enter, they all have herpes sores on their faces, well except Liane for some reason...

Sharon

Stanley, how are you feeling today, son?

Stan

Pretty good.

Sharon

[Cheerfully.] The doctor says that maybe you can go home tomorrow.

Randy

Yeah. Isn't that great, Stanley?

Stan

Wow, coo-hul!

Sheila

And how are you, Kyle?

Gerald

Are you doing okay?

Kyle

I'm better now.

-----


He and Stan start laughing.

Sharon

What's so funny, you two?

Kyle

We gave you guys herpes.

Sheila

What-what-whaaat?! You did this?!

Stan

We got you back for getting us sick. We had a prostitute use your toothbrushes and stuff.

Randy

I can't believe you gave us herpes. You little rascals!

Sharon

[To Randy.] Well, I guess it serves us right. [To the boys.] Kids, we should have honest about wanting you to get chickenpox.

Sheila

It's true. We were wrong for deceiving you about it.

-----


Liane walks over to Cartman.

Cartman

Hey, how come you don't have sores on your lips, Ma?

Liane

Ooh, I have them somewhere else, poopiekins.

Cartman

Hooray!

Gerald

And, uh Stuart, I think I owe you an apology. I realize that I shouldn't be so cold towards people that are less fortunate than me.

Stuart

Aww hell, I'm sorry, too.

-----


Terrance and Phillip is on. The anal transplant surgery was a success.

Terrance

Oh, Phillip, I'm so glad everything turned out for the better.

-----


He farts high and laughs.

Cartman

Well, I know one thing for sure.

Liane

What's that, Eric?

Cartman

We're all gonna need a lot more calamine lotion.

-----


All the boys start laughing, then the parents join in. The doctor stands by Kenny and doesn't laugh. Kenny laughs, but drops dead. The meter flatlines and a long, steady note is heard. All stop laughing.

Stan

Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!

Kyle

You bastards!

-----


Stan laughs, then Kyle, then everyone else, including Kenny's parents. End of Chickenpox. "I'm A Believer" plays.
